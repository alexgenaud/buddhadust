					<h4 class="ctr c">Language in Early Buddhism<br />
					and Other Articles of Interest in Buddhist Studies</h4>

					<p>The following is a list of interesting looking articles focused primarily on the language of early Buddhism but including some more general topics. The list was culled from the results of a much larger and more general and multi-lingual search done on ccbs.ntu.edu.tw. It would be most helpful to one and all if those finding these articles on line or finding names of publishers, journals, etc and dates of publication would get back to me with the information.</p>
