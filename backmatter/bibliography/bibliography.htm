					<h4><a id="donJuanSeries">Carlos Castaneda</a></h4>

					<p><b>The Teachings of don Juan</b> A Yaqui Way of Knowledge<br />
					Pages : 288<br />
					Pub Date : 1968, 1973<br />
					Publisher : Univ. of California Press, Simon &amp; Schuster</p>

					<p><b>A Separate Reality: Further Conversations with don Juan</b><br />

					<b>The Art of Dreaming:</b> 1993</p>

					<p>For the Magic of this series to come through it must be read in sequence. Feel free to debate with yourself as to whether or not this series represents the depiction of real events — in the process of doing this, however, I suggest you try and find one internal contradiction. For Buddhists this is an important series because many of the techniques Don Juan uses are the same as those of Buddhists. This should not be too much of a surprise when we learn, towards the end of the series, that Don Juan and many of his associates studied Buddhism in China.</p>

					<p>There are two other books in this series, one giving exercises in Magical Passes and one which to my mind is most interesting because it was apparently written before the first book and is clearly the work of an ordinary man ... and yet an extraordinary man even then.</p>

					<p>Two other related series also exist. Works by two of Don Juan's female apprentices. Taisha Abelar and Florinda Donner Grau.</p>

					<p><b>Shabono</b>, Florinad Donner-Grau, Delacorte Press, New York, 1982<br />
					This is the first of her books. They too should be read in order. This is one of the most astounding books you will ever read. All three together are even moreso. Here Florinda follows the signs and ends up 'going native' among a tribe of Yanomama Indians in the jungle boardering Venezuela and Brazil. This is what it means to be committed, to lend the mind as well as the body to one's path. There is maybe a one-sentence reference in this book to her teacher, one of Don Juan's group. There is no attempt to make a tie-in to Castaneda.</p>

					<p><b>The Witches Dream</b>: Florinda Donner-Grau, 1987, Simon and Schuster, Inc., New York <br />
					A real work of art. Here Florinda is instructed in the nature of magical power through the life stories of a half dozen patients of a healer in Venezuela. You need to work at it to see what she is doing, but by the end of the book it has painted an incredable picture. Again, although the entire adventure was instigated by the teacher in Don Juan's group, there is hardly any mention of her and none of Castaneda. Carlos does provide an introduction to the work. Cynics would say at this point that she was trying to boost her book sales by this introduction. That would argue against the idea that she was working with Carlos in his hoax. To be convincing one would want as disinterested a witness as could be found. What we have here is as disinterested a witness as could be found ... only to be 'spoiled' by C.C.'s Introduction.</p>

					<p><a id="being_in_dreaming"><b>Being-In-Dreaming</b>,</a> Florinda Donner-Grau, Harper, New York, 1991<br />
					Florinda recounts her introduction to the Sorcerers' world. Here we too are introduced to Florinda's teacher and we find out that it is the same group with which Carlos has been involved. She describes her meeting with Carlos and some early encounters.</p>

					<p><b>The Sorcerer's Crossing</b>, Taisha Abelar, Viking Penguin, U.S.A., 1992 </p>

					<p class="f4">That anyone who actually read all of Castaneda's work and also the works of these other two authors who could still believe that this is a work of fiction (a hoax) gives too much credit to the mind of ordinary humans. A lie of this complexity and perfection would be a work of sorcerery in itself.</p>
