					<h1>Index Key for the Majjhima Nikaya Sutta Index</h1>

					<div class="nobdr">
					<p class="f2"><b>BD</b> = (BuddhaDust) the translations of M.Olds<br />
					<b>SBB</b> = Sacred Books of the Buddhists, <b>Further Dialogues of the Buddha,</b> Lord Robert Chalmsers, translations.<br />
					<b>PTS</b> = <a href="http://www.palitext.com/">Pali Text Society</a> <b>The Collection of The Middle Length Sayings,</b> Translated by I.B. Horner, 3 Volumes<br />
					<b>WP</b> = <a href="http://www.wisdompubs.org/">Wisdom Publications</a> <b>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha,</b> Translated by Bhikkhu Nanamoli and edited and revised by Bhikkhu Bodhi<br />
					<b>ATI</b> = <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/">Access to Insight</a>. Primarily the translations of Bhikkhu Thanissaro.<br />
					Other sources are spelled out.</p>

					<p>If the sutta name is a link, that version of the sutta is contained on this site and the link is to that version.<br />
					Page numbers following the Pali name and in the text itself are references to the Pali Text Society edition of the Pali.</p>

					<p>If, in the Pali text or a translation you see a number, and it looks like this:  <a id="pg1"><span class="f2 g"><b>[1]</b></span></a> that is the page number of the original source of that text and that page number is an identified object to which you may link by appending to the url for the page "#pg1" (without the quotation marks.) When the page number is in other formats, it has not yet been given an identity. You may, however, link to it in the same way in the expectation that at some point it will be given such an id. So doing will not invalidate the link it will just point to the top of the page.</p>

					<p>Example: Use: "[website]/dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.013.horn.pts.htm#pg119" for Horner's <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.013.horn.pts.htm#pg119">MN.13, page 119</a>.</p>

					<p>Similarly, in the cases of those books primarily composed of verses, verse numbers appear like this: <a id="v1"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1]</b></span></a> and may be linked to by appending to the url for the page "#v1"</p>

					<p>Example: Use  "[website]/dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.240.rhyc.pts.htm#v601" for Mrs. Rhys Davids' <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.240.rhyc.pts.htm#v601">THAG.240, verse 601</a></p>

					<p>Page references to the Pali within translations have the following appearance: <a id="pt348" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg348"><span class="f2">[348]</span></a> and will eventually all be links to the PTS Pali Text Page number as located on this site's BJT/PTS hybrid Pali Text. These links can themselves be linked to by appending "#pt000" (without the quotation marks; zeros do not precede single or double digit numbers) to the url.</p>
