					<p>The Buddha, from a brief discussion of the four types of individuals found in the world, when asked to elaborate expounds on the habits of those intent on harmful ascetic practices, those who follow a bloody calling, those who torment both themselves and others, and those who neither torment themselves nor torment others. By way of the last group he teaches a detailed course of progress from layman to the benefits of Arahantship.</p>

					<h4><a id="p52">52</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm">Aṭṭhaka-Nāgara Suttantaɱ,</a> I.349</h4>
					
					<p>In this sutta Ananda explains to a householder how Arahantship can be attained via any single one of eleven different avenues.<br />
					The avenues are any one of the four jhanas, the brahmaVihāras, or the arupa jhanas up to the Realm of No Thing's to be Had. The effeciant cause of the attainment, it is clear, is not the jhana or meditative state, but the insight that that state itself has been own-made and is impermanent.<br />
					It is important to note that here is an unequivocal statement that it is possible to attain Arahantship directly from the First Jhana. I stress this point to the readers here not to make out that it is any easy task, but only to refute the notion that it is an impossible one, or that it is absolutely necessary to attain all Four Jhanas which is to make the task appear to be absolutely out of reach for most people today. To attain the First Jhana one must abandon all desire for sensual pleasures, give up foolish conduct, and become entheusiastic about the enjoyment of solitude. Most people can do this much. It requires a little effort. You need to find some place where you can be alone and undisturbed for several hours. Then remember: The Jhanas are not the goal, they are just the platform. At this point one must see the impermanance of all things that have been constructed to form one's individual world including this very mental state called the Jhana, any body, sensation, perception, personal construction, and individualized consciousness. Then one must see that this impermanance, for one attached to the world, inevitably brings pain, and that what is painful cannot be the self. So seeing, one is repelled by constructed things, repelled one abandons them and constructs no more, having abandoned construction one is free, in freedom, seeing freedom, one can know: rebirth is left behind (it requires construction), lived is the best of lives, duty's duty has been done and there is no more being any kind of an 'it' at any place of 'atness' left for one. This is Nibbana, Arahantship, being no longer subject to Time and Death, the Unseen Consciousness of the utterly purified Mind void of any identification with 'self'.</p>

					<p>Ananda delivers a variation on The Gradual Course. Here he gives the laymen of Kapilavatthu a discourse on undertaking the quest for awakening from the point of undertaking the training in ethical behavior right on up to the eradication of the Corrupting Influences in Nibbana. It is possible this sutta was intended for laymen directly, (in which case it is encouraging laymen to become arahants) but I believe rather that it was intended to encourage some to enter the order, and to show the others the nature of the practice of the bhikkhus.</p>

					<h4><a id="p54">54</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm">Potaliya Suttantaɱ,</a> I.359</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha explains in detail what it means to have given up all avocations in this Dhamma.<br />
					Note that here, speaking to a layman, the Buddha is describing the attainment of the three visions of the Arahant as being attained just subsequent to the abandoning of pleasures of the senses. That is, without any specific mention of even the first jhana.<br />
					Based on this one could say that Arahantship is attainable without jhana; or one could say: The conditions for the first jhana are met with, and the conditions for the fourth jhana are met with, so there is here the attainment of arahantship with jhana.<br />
					Why is jhana not mentioned here? I suggest it is because the discussion proceeds from the request to provide the entire giving up in every way of all occupations. Jhana, as jhana, is essentially an occupation.<br />
					This sutta contains the details for the similes for the pleasures of the senses, that is that the pleasures of the senses are like a meatless bone, carrion attacked by vultures, a blazing torch carried against the wind, falling into a pit of glowing charcoal, a loan, having climbed a tree to enjoy the fruit while another man is chopping it down.</p>

					<h4><a id="p55">55</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.055.pali.bd.htm">Jīvaka Suttantaɱ</a> I.368</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha refutes the accusation that he allows the eating of the flesh of animals killed specifically for him and he explains the peramaters that allow the eating of meat.<br />
					A sutta to consult when the endless debate over vegetarianism comes up. Let me have another shot at clarifying the situation. There is kamma, and there are the rules for the bhikkhus, and there is doing good deeds. As far as kamma goes, the operant factor, the efficient cause of a kammic consequence, is intent. Where there is no intent to cause harm, there is no kammic consequences. The rules for the bhikkhus are based on the law of kamma. There being no intent to harm in connection with eating meat that was not killed by one's self, killed upon request by  one's self, or suspected to have been killed specifically for one, there is no kammic consequence and there is no rule against eating meat of such a sort. Where some individual decides that he wishes to reduce the demand for meat that is the motive for the butchering of animals, that is an intentional good deed and is to be praised. When an individual blames a person who does not have any intent to harm living creatures, but who eats meat as per the factors that make it kammically blameless, then that person is blind to the nature of kamma and is making bad kamma by holding a wrong mental position. And the louder and more forcefully they do that, the worse is the bad kamma they make. Finally, the bhikkhus are beggars. Beggars should not be choosers. They are in the right refusing meat that is not allowable because in the refusal is a lesson given to the doner of what is allowable. But in the ordinary course of the begging round for a beggar to refuse meat lawfully given is to deprive the doner of good kamma and that is bad kamma. There are countries which are primarily vegetarian and situations where the bhikkhu may have a choice. In the case where the doner of a food gift gives the bhikkhu a choice, there is no problem with his requesting to be given vegetarian food only. The layman, of course, can choose to be a vegetarian or not according as he wishes with no adverse consequences.</p>

					<h4><a id="p60">60</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm">Apaṇṇaka Suttantaɱ,</a> I.400</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha explains a logical way to behave when faced with uncertainty as to what one should believe.<br />
					This sutta should be read by every skeptic and every realist who can see of himself that he does not know or see such things as the workings of kamma, rebirth according to one's deeds, the existence of Heaven and Hell, gods, God or the Devil, etc. The logic of the sutta is incontrovertable, indeed. It only makes sense to cover your bets. To hold the position that 'there is no' (kamma, God, etc.) is actually to say that one 'knows,' and to say that one knows means that one is claiming to know all. How else could one know that 'there was not'? If a thing exists, it can be seen. Perhaps not by everyone, but sooner or later it can be seen. If a thing does not exist, one would need to see absolutely everything to know that it did not exist. And then, maybe you missed something. Then, too, to say that one knows that 'there is not' is to say that one knows more than those who have said that 'there is.' That is 'exalting one's self and disparaging others.'<br />
					I think Bhk. Bodhi's understanding of what he calls 'The Doctrine of Non-doing' is not well reflected in his choice of sub-title for this section. The idea is not that this is a doctrine of 'Not-doing', but that this is a doctrine where people believe that there is no kammic result of deeds, no 'doing' in the sense of creating consequences. It is saying that there is 'no <i>bad</i> (or good) action' 'kamma' 'action' or 'doing,' not 'no doing'. The idea 'bad' or 'good' implies 'consequences.' Certainly we can see with our own eyes that 'doing' has occurred. 'Kamma' here is being translated one-sidedly, that is only as the 'doing', but the idea of the 'doctrine' is that there is no 'result' (the other side of 'kamma'.) Buddhism itself can be characterized as a doctrine of 'not-doing': 'the not doing of unskillful deeds.' For example, the intent to not do a kammic deed identified with own-making in thought, word, or deed.<br />
					There is a similar misplaced emphasis in Bhk. Thanissaro's "Action and Non-Action."</p>

					<p>Malunkyaputta, dissatisfied that the Buddha has not answered a number of questions concerning existence and non-existence (whether or not the world is vast, or an ending thing or whether or not the self and the body are one thing or different things, or in what way the arahant manifests after death) confronts Gotama who explains to him that these questions are not expounded upon because they are not relevant to the goal of ending suffering. This sutta contains the famous simile of the man who refuses to accept medical treatment for an arrow wound until he knows all about the arrow, the shooter, etc.</p>

					<p>The wanderer Vekhanassa, teacher of Sakuludāyin, has come to challenge Gotama but is shown to be holding a viewpoint based entirely on hearsay ("This is the highest lustre ...") which breaks down under close questioning. He is then led to acceptance of the more realistic doctrine of the Buddha.<br />
					What is it that by the end has convinced Vekhanassa that he is holding on to a belief which he himself does not see for himself? What convinces him that Gotama knows a saving <i>dhamma?</i> Challenged by way of a simile, Gotama, using similes, releases Vekhanassa from 'sutta-bondage' (a key use of word-play missed by Ms. Horner). The whole dynamic goes on beyond anything actually stated in the sutta and without 'seeing' what Gotama does or how it is working on Vekhanassa's mind, it makes no sense. This is a exquisite example of the magic of a sutta.</p>

					<p>The Buddha's wandering brings him to a spot where the Buddha Kassapa once taught and where at that time in a previous birth as Jotipala, Gotama had to be dragged by the hair to visit this Buddha and hear his Dhamma.<br />
					Of course there developed a great controversy over this sutta concerning the idea that a Buddha is 'self-awakened', not brought to awakening by having heard another's doctrine. But there is hearing a doctrine and even professing great belief in it without understanding a word of it or what it was intended to accomplish. Gotama makes the statement that it was under this Buddha (Kassapa Buddha) that he '... lived the higher life for supreme enlightenment in the future.' This can mean no more than that he lived within the rules of a bhikkhu with the intent to attain awakening. It says nothing about having accomplished even the first step of this desire.

					<p>The story of Ratthapala who, inspired by a Dhammatalk given by the Buddha wishes to enter the order but is refused the permission of his parents. (Up to 200 years or so ago even in Europe it was common that 'children' (males and females) up to the age of 25 and older were required by law to ask permission of their parents for such things as marriage. They could be put in jail for disobediance.) He vows to die on the spot unless he receives permission and after many pleadings by his parents and friends finally gets his parents concent. He thereafter quickly becomes arahant. On revisiting his family he is first unrecognized and subjected to abuse, then his father tries to tempt him to return to the world with gold and his former wives. He is not persuaded and delivers a sermon in verses on the subject of the pains in the world. Still later he discourses to the king on four doctrines of the Buddha concerning the futility of living in the world.</p>

					<p>Raja Pasenadi pays a visit to the Buddha and shows great respect and enumerates the reasons for his great respect. As well as the content of this sutta being food for thought, the sutta is also interesting as a window on history. It is as this discussion is taking place that the king's son usurps the throne. We get a glimpse into the very moment of decision when Digha Karayana, the commander and chief of the Mallas, who is attending on the king asks himself why he must just stand around while the King fawns on the Buddha. At the time, the authority of kingship was vested in certain symbols: the umbrella, sword, turban ... and Pasenadi had removed his sword and turban out of respect for the Buddha, and had given them to Digha Karayana to hold for him, but he went off with them and made Pasenadi's son king.</p>

					<p>The Brahmin Brahmayu, at the age of 120, is converted and becomes a non-returner when he sees the 32 marks of a great man in Gotama and is taught a gradual course in Dhamma.<br />
					This sutta has several interesting features. The casual mention of this brahmin as being 120 years old and 'reaching life's termination'! is only one of several such examples of life expectancy at the time. The 32 marks of the Superman are always a good challenge. Try and work out in your mind how these marks can be both physically visible and representative of superiority or special powers in a being. Note the manner of the exchange; that is, in verse. This was a frequent form of debate and required that the one challenged reply to the challenge in the form of the challenge. Verse required a reply in verse, etc. Today such debates are still to be found in Spain and Arab countries and in musical battles in many countries. Also note the extreme politeness and respect in the brahmin's behavior.</p>

					<p>Keniya, a matted hair ascetic is greatly satisfied by a teaching of the Buddha and invites him and the order of bhikkhus, 1200 in number to a meal for the next day. In the meantime Sela the Brahman seeing the preparations for the meal being made by Keniya, is told that it is for an Awakened One. Sela is stirred by the idea of an Awakened One and visits the Buddha immediately and he, and his 300 followers are converted. The next day the Buddha and the order of bhikkhus, some 1500 in number show up for the meal.<br />
					This sutta is full of magic! There is no mention at all of Keniya being in the slightest way disturbed by the addition of 300 guests for the meal. Can you see why? Note the way that Gotama responds in kind to the address in verse. This sutta gives us a peek into the very different way things were done within the closed society of the Brahmins versus that of the ordinary people of the time.</p>

					<p>A debate between a brahmin and the Buddha concerning the relative merits of the casts. A thoroughly rational and convincing set of arguments for the position that it is individual merit, not birth that distinguishes one man from another.<br />
					Well, this is not just a debate with good logical points being made. It is withering assault on a stupid idea that twists the argument into a knot and tosses it aside. It is to the credit of Gotama's opponent that he never believed he would win the argument in the first place and that he so gracefully acknowledges defeat in becoming a disciple of the Buddha.<br />
					An interesting point that comes up in passing is the notion of how conception occurs and the role in that of the Gandhabba. The role of the Gandhabba is questioned by some. Here it is clear that the Gandhabba is the spirit of the being to be reborn. This is not some guardian spirit or musical chorus attending the event to make sure of it's success. Further, though there is no mention of this here, or elsewhere that I know of, there is competition for this role in the event. Fierce competition, as with the stream of millions of spermatozoa competing to be the one fertalizing the one egg. Imagine then, on top of the competition between Ghandhabbas seeking rebirth, and the competition between the millions of spermatazoa coming down one individual's ... um ... stream, the competition between beings for the roles as the participating male and female in the picture, and you begin to get some sense of the difficulty of finding rebirth again as a human, once death has overtaken the body.</p>

					<h4><a id="p98">98</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.098.pali.bd.htm">Vāseṭṭha Suttaɱ,</a> II.196</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha resolves the dispute between two brahman youths. One held the belief that a brahman was a brahman because of birth, the other that a brahman was a brahman because of deeds. In many examples the Buddha shows that one is a brahman because of deeds.<br />
					God-like behavior brings one into alignment with the original benevolent objective creative force and one merges into and becomes God; corrupt behavior (essentially biased, self-serving, "self-ish" behavior) separates and distances one from the original creative force and continuing on in that direction one ends up in Hell.</p>
