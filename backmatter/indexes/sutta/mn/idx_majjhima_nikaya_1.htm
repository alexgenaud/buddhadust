					Here the Buddha reveals the root concepts of all things.<br />
					In it's expanded form (found in my translation) it is certainly a hypnotic spell, and will, as if by magic, take one back to the very origins of the world. It builds up from that by way of fundamental concepts at the root of all things, verbal and physical and beyond to Nibbana. It is an excellent sutta, by the way, for learning the Pali language.</p>

					<p>The Buddha urges the bhikkhus to become heirs of Dhamma, not of worldly things. By heirs of Dhamma he explains, he means putting the Dhamma into practice as he himself puts it into practice. Sariputta follows up on this exhortation with details. It is by not putting this Dhamma into practice as the Buddha did that senior bhikkhus, middle-ranked bhikkhus and juniors, one and all come to blameworthiness, and it is by putting it into practice in this way that one and all come to praiseworthiness.</p>

					<p>Brahman Janussoni questions the Buddha about the fears and distractedness of mind that arise on living alone in the wilderness. The Buddha explains that for those with corrupt behavior in body, speech and thought; with passionate desires, corrupt at heart, lazy, nervous, doubt-ridden, proud and arrogant, fearful, hungary for fame and gains, weak in energy, confused, without concentration, and weak in wisdom such a life does inspire fear, but for one without these corruptions such a life strengthens one in pursuit of the goal.</p>

					<p>The Buddha likens a dirty cloth incapable of taking dye to the mind corrupted by greed and covetousness, malevolence, anger, malice, hypocrisy, spite, envy, stinginess, deceit, treachery, obstinacy, impetuosity, arrogance, price and conceit — incapable of attaining a good rebirth. He then likens the cleansing of a dirty piece of cloth that renders it capable of taking dye to the process of cleansing the mind of these corruptions, and he describes this cleansing process.</p>

					<p>Maha Cunda approaches the Buddha to ask how to eliminate ideas of 'I' and 'mine'. The Buddha's response is to give him pairs of opposites to be resolved upon, thought of, used as guides to follow, things leading upward and which will scour out ideas of 'I' and 'Mine.'<br />
					The fourty-four things are each repeated in accordance with these six ways of dealing with them. This is definately a 'scouring out' not an expunging! Ms. Horner has fallen victim to the challenge to the memory and changed her translation in mid-stream in this sutta which can lead to the misperception that there are a different fourty-four things being spoken of after the first two cycles. I have noted the change on her translation.</p>

					<p>The Buddha explains the logic behind the difference between the Buddhist proclaiming faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha and those of other beliefs proclaiming faith in their teacher, teachings and fellow-believers.<br />
					A very interesting sutta! Essentially the difference is in the perception that the Buddha's system works or ought to work in accomplishing what is in effect the goal of all seekers, that there is nothing left unexplained, and that since this is not the case in other faiths, that the faith of those who follow such is never, can never be fully vested. The inference is that faith is not fully vested <i>by a Buddhist</i> until such time as he has perceived that the system works, or ought to work.</p>

					<p>Mahanama the Sakkyan, lamenting over his state of confusion with regard to pleasures of the senses, is given a detailed exposition of what constitutes the pleasure and the danger of the five senses, the thing that is binding Mahanama to confusion, and the way the Buddha himself escaped such confusion. The Buddha then describes an encounter with some Jains wherein he defeats their claim that the end of pain is to be got through pain by showing them that they are practicing their painful austerities without any support in knowledge or understanding and concludes with a description of the exceptional pleasure which he is able to attain.</p>

					<p>The Buddha cuts off an argumentative questioner by telling him that in his teaching there is no arguing with anyone about anything and by this he is free. In repeating the insident to the bhikkhus he is questioned as to what this teaching is that argues with no one about anything. The Buddha explains in brief that it is by having no interest in the obsessions and perceptions that assail the mind. Then further the bhikkhus ask for a clarification of this of Maha Kaccana, who speaks of the obsessions and perceptions that arise from sense experience.<br />
					Mrs. Horner, following the Pali, abridges two repetitions of the main body of this sutta. The abridgments in the Pali are not indicated as abridgments (by the usual "...pe...") but are done with summary statements. The usual case would have been that the monks and then the Buddha would have repeated all that which had been said and done in each case (each repetition making precise recollection more likely and testifying to the veracity of the testimony). This method of abridgment alone speaks to the fact that the Majjhima was compiled later than either the Anguttara Nikaya or the Samyutta Nikaya. It represents a lessening (however slight) of the respect for precision in recounting the events and sayings of the Buddha, a degradation likely resulting from the arising of the written text. As with cell-phone texting today [Monday, November 16, 2015 6:40 AM] and e-mail yesterday and television before that and radio before that and writing before that, each new generation of communication and memory enhansing devices destroys rather than inhances communication while degrading our ability to remember.</p>

					<h4><a id="p21">21</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.021.pali.bd.htm">Kakacūpama Suttaɱ,</a> I.122</h4>
					
					<p>A famous sutta dealing with the idea that the student of this system should not concern himself with worldly matters, even those so close to home as the abuse of nuns ... to say nothing of abuse of chickens ... (or one might say: concern as to the contents of one's own bowl, let alone the contents of your neighbours bowl) ... also dealing with the need for patience and endurance when faced with disagreeable speech (true or false) ... to be counteracted by training in a heart of friendliness towards one and all.</p>

					<p>The Venerable Moliyaphagguna is too attached to the nuns and whenever anyone speaks in dispraise of them he raises a legal issue. He is brought before the Buddha who says this is unworthy behavior of one having gone forth out of faith, and says (my <b><i>boldface italics</i></b>):</p>

							<p class="in2">Wherefore, Phagguna,<br />
							even if anyone face to face with you<br />
							should speak dispraise of those nuns,<br />
							even so should you, Phagguna,<br />
							get rid of those <b><i>which are worldly desires</i></b>,<br />
							those which are worldly thoughts;<br />
							and you, Phagguna,<br />
							should train yourself thus:</p>

							<p class="in2">'Neither will my mind become perverted,<br />
							nor will I utter an evil speech,<br />
							but kindly and compassionate will I dwell<br />
							with a mind of friendhness and void of hatred.'</p>

					<p>This attitude of detachment from what goes on in the world (and by 'world' is meant any form of individualized existence, including in heaven or identification with Brahmā) is extremely important and so totally different than what is taught in virtually every religion in the world that it needs to be brought up again and again. Trying to become a world reforming activist Buddhist is the single biggest mistake being made by people entering the Buddhist Order in these times [Sunday, November 17, 2013 4:29 AM], and it is also at the root of the difference between what is taught in the Pali and what is being taught by the Mahayanist schools.</p>

					<h4><a id="p22">22</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.022.pali.bd.htm">Alagaddūpama Suttaɱ,</a> I.130</h4>
					
					<p>A wide-ranging very famous sutta that begins with a forceful teaching on the dangers of indulgence in sense pleasures. This sutta contains two famous similies: the similie of the snake illustrating how a wrong grasp of the Dhamma is like taking hold of a poisonous snake from the wrong end; and the simile of the raft illustrating how the Dhamma should be used to attain it's ends and then be let go. The sutta concludes with a thorough examination of the way 'not self' should be considered.<br />
					The interesting question here is why would Arittha hang on so stubbornly to his view about the harmlessness of sense-pleasure indulgence? It is possible of course that he was just a fool (but he was not unskilled in meditation, see: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.006.olds.bd.htm#fn1">SN 5.54.6</a> where Gotama thought enough of him to give him special instruction on the in-and-out-breathing practice). But the likelihood is that he was trapped by a perception that befalls one who holds the view that there is no self. In this view a number of very dangerous conclusions can be reached because there is perceived to be no individuality there to experience the consequences of deeds. This would justify the simile of the snake and would explain the long dissertation that follows concerning the 'not-self' position. The presence here of the simile of the raft might also be explained as a hint to Arittha that if even the Dhamma could be let go, he could certainly let go his view. There is also in this sutta a very interesting remark made by Gotama as to constructing theories about the self where he states that even if there were a self that was incomprehensible, it would be foolishness to form theories about it. This statement is a little obscure and is made only in this sutta and has caused some confusion. Ms. Horner's translation is the most potentially misleading. The idea is that it is shown that examining things as they really are, there is no comprehension of a self possible, BUT even if there were a self that was incomprehensible, it would be foolish to speculate about it because it's paramaters could not be encompassed by speculations made within the scope of comprehension. This is not, as Ms. Horner's translation would indicate, an asertion that there is a self.</p>

					<p>The Buddha uses a simile to warn the bhikkhus not to mistake fame, or achievement of ethical culture, or attainment of concentration, or attainment of knowledge and vision for attainment of permanent freedom disconnected from Time, which is the goal of his system.<br />
					There is a problem with the last section of the Pali. The problem is either with the PTS Pali or the BJT/CSCD (BBS and SBJ eds.,) or all of the above. In the PTS the the first half of the last section, before the simile, has the bhikkhu attaining release from things connected to time which is then cast as a position from which he is likely to fall away. The second half of the PTS version of the last section has the bhikkhu attaining release from things not connected to time which is then cast as a position from which there is no falling away. The other versions of the Pali and the translations (all the other translations) have the first and second halfs of the section as identical.

					<p>Saccaka, who has been boasting and bragging that he can defeat the Buddha in debate when he meets him in debate is upset after his first utterance. The Buddha then teaches him Dhamma.<br />
					This is a wonderful example of old time debate. It also shows how politely and reasonably such a debate was conducted even when the consequences were as hair-raising as they are shown to be in this sutta. There is no attempt to bring the debate to a pre-mature conclusion simply because Saccaka feels bad. What our board monitors need to see is that by terminating debate for the sake of maintaining good feelings is preventing the discovery of deeper truths. We hang on to our beliefs; getting them destroyed is painful; going through that pain is the only way of reaching higher wisdom.<br />
					This debate also shows how a really wise debator takes defeat and turns it into an advantage.<br />
					This sutta concludes with an exchange which should put to rest all doubt about the impossibility of transference of kamma. Saccaka, in gratitude for his instruction, invites the Buddha and the sangha for a meal. To prepare the meal he asks his friends to donate to him what they feel they owe him. He then gives what he has received to the Buddha and the Saŋgha. Then he asks that the merit for such a meal be received by the doners. The Buddha explains that the doners have given to Saccaka and will receive kammic consequences that accord with the rebound from one such as him whereas Saccaka, who gave to the Buddha will receive the kammic consequences of one who has given to a Buddha. No transference of kamma.</p>

					<p>The Buddha teaches Saccaka about training the body and training the heart.<br />
					In this sutta we once again come upon Gotama's description of his extreme austerities in his attempt to attain Awakening, his subsequent rejection of such practices, and his recollection of an insident in his youth that pointed to a successful practice.<br />
					Sitting there he finds himself in a very peaceful state of mind which he describes in a formula that later becomes know as 'the First <i>Jhāna</i>' — 'knowing'; it is a point at which two things are seen with absolute clarity: 1. it is got by letting go of (separating from) lesser states; and 2. it is a higher form of happiness than sense pleasure; that is at this point one knows for certain one is on the right track.</p>

					      <p class="in2"><i>Separated from Sensuaity,<br />
							Separated from Unskillful things,<br />
							With Thinking and With Pondering<br />

					<p>Here we have, side-by-side, both the formula and an illuminating image of this entry point to the attaining of Awakening.</p>

					<p>At ease sitting at the root of the rose-apple tree, the young prince is seen <i>just prior</i> to his entry into puberty (separated from sensuality). He is separated from his father and the commencement of the ceremony (separated from unskillful things), yet is observant of the situation. What you need to know is that the Plowing Ceremony is a 'rite of spring', a 'fertility rite', a ceremony that would introduce a youth to sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p>The well-known sutta in which the Buddha explains the idea that consciousness is a conditioned phenomena and is not the self that transmigrates from one birth to the next.<br />
					This is a very important sutta to understand clearly. (The Chalmers translation is too abridged to be of much help, see the other translations for a better perspective.)<br />
					All consciousness is a result of the coming together of conditions.<br />
					There are various sorts of consciousness depending on the conditions which give rise to it.<br />
					Consciousness is not a self that transmigrates from one existence to the next.<br />
					The subjective aparent continuity of individuality from moment to moment and life to life is a matter of illusion. A case of mistaken identity: Identification with conscousness assumed to be the continuation of an identification with consciousness that performed deeds with the intent of creating this consciousness.<br />
					After determining that it is individualized consciousness (among the various sorts of consciousness) that Sati believes transmigrates from birth to birth, the Buddha deals with that form of consciousness from the point of view of the factors on which it is dependent and the mechanism of rebirth itself. The mechanics of the arising of consciousness in ordinary rebirth must be understood before it can be seen how there arises a second sort of consciousness that is not dependent on individualized existence.<br />
					There are then two <i>general</i> categories of consciousness: Consciousness conditioned by things of Time; and consciousness conditioned by things not of Time.<br />
					Consciousness conditioned by things of time (the six senses) is a thing of time and comes to an end.<br />
					This is the consciousness of the ordinary individual.<br />
					When consciousness is conditioned by consciousness of freedom from things of time, it is consciousness conditioned by things not of time.<br />
					That consciousness, though it is conditioned, has not been own-made, identified-with, and is not an 'existing thing' but is only a consciousness of not being a thing, is not identified-with as "I" or "mine", and because not dependent on something that comes to an end, does not itself come to an end and is the goal of this system.<br />
					Again: Consciousness arises dependedent on conditions.<br />
					If the conditions present are consciousness of freedom from things of Time, the resulting consciousness is consciousness of consciousness of things not of Time. It has arisen as a result of conditons, not as a result of the willing of an individual (i.e., own-making, or sankharaming.) Consciousness, freed from things of time, is unlimited, not bound to Time, deathless... Nirvana: Out of the Woods; Nibbana, unbound.<br />
					Returning to the sutta: An individual who sees consciousness like this does not speculate about the past, future or present nature of a self. He may have vision of past lives, but he also sees that none of them were the self of him. He knows of the future that there is no thing which will be identified with as the self. He knows of the present that there is no thing there that is the self. This is a simpler way of seeing things than the divisions that are created by the assumption of individuality and consequently he is not confused about things of the past, future or present. Things come to be as a consequence of conditions (kamma); without conditions they do not come to be; on the ending of the conditions that brought them about, they cease to be. For all things. Not just "me" or "them".<br />
					If you can see how ordinary rebirth-consciousness arises as a consequence of conditions, you can then see how with different conditions (consciousness of consciousness of things not of Time) a different sort of consciousness can arise and you can direct 'mind' to that second sort of consciousness which, unending, deathless, and free from time is clearly superior.</p>

					<p>The lay follower Visakha asks his former wife, the nun Dhammadinna a series of questions concerning Dhamma and receives answers approved of later by the Buddha. The questions asked reveal a number of the more subtle points in understanding the internal make up of the Dhamma. This is definately a good sutta to compare with the Pali and other translations.</p>

					<p>Four modes of practicing Dhamma: Pleasureable in the present with painful consequences; painful in the present with painful consequences; painful in the present with pleasurable consequences; and pleasurable in the present with pleasurable consequences. The same theme as the previous sutta, but differently expanded.<br />
					The four described differently than in the previous sutta and here given similies. Very good suttas to read when your practice seems to be resulting in nothing but grief. You stop drinking and find you have no friends; you stop killing and find your house full of cockroaches, etc. One of the most difficult barriers to overcome because it comes at the beginning of one's practice when one has very little experience to bolster one's will power.</p>

					<p>The Buddha explains how to think to achieve Stream-entry and then describes seven fruits of Stream-entry.<br />
					This description of the fruit of Stream-entry does not include the usual 'never again to be reborn in states lower than human birth, and rebirth only seven more times at most' but in some ways these are more valuable in that they deal with mental attitudes one acquires which are extraordinarily re-assuring and form the basis for enthusiasm for greater effort at attainment.</p>

					<p>The Buddha visits Baka Brahma who has come to the belief that he is immortal. The Buddha disabuses him of this idea and demonstrates his authority with an act of psychic power.Each translator has his own notion of what the title of this sutta may mean. PED has the term 'nimantana' as 'invitation'. NI = in; MANT = mind, command; intend. Ms. Horner: 'Challenge'; Bhks. Thanissaro and Bhodi: 'invitation'; Sister Upalavanna: 'Address'. How about: 'All of the above.' A pun, meaning to address, and invite, and challenge. Address as in sword-fighting; invite as in kung-fu movies where one fighter indicates with his hand 'bring it on'; or the 'Invitation Hand' of Wu Dan kung-fu indicating that the opponent should commense if he is going to fight; a challenge to combat or to discovery.</p>

					<p>Mara tries to upset Maha Moggallāna and is told of Maha Moggallāna's own experience as Mara attempting to upset bhikkhus where he ends up in Niraya with the body of a man and the head of a fish boiling for many hundreds of thousands of years. The gatha at the end is about as close to an old-time curse as is found in Buddhism. (But note that Moggallāna clearly shows how this is not a curse, that he holds no ill-will, and that it is strictly this Mara's own deed that will bring about the dread consequences. In fact what we may be seeing here is the way the curse originated, that is as a simple statement of what a real seer sees as the consequences to someone of what they have done. Only later to be transformed into a wish.)</p>
