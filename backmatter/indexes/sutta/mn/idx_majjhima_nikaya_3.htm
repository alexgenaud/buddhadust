					<h4><a id="p101">101</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm">Devadaha Suttaɱ,</a> II.214</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha gives a detailed refutation of the doctrine of the Jains and sets forth his counter-argument in his method for the ending of kamma.<br />
					An extremely important sutta which is a shameful mess in the Horner translation and it is not at all clear in the other translations. It needs an entirely new translation. I have done a paraphrase version in which one can at least follow the argument.<br />
					It is a world-wide phenomena in religions that the dues required for salvation is pain. The Buddha refutes this argument by explaining that it is by not reacting (that is 'not reacting'; that is not 'not experiencing'; one does not fight against or pursue the furtherance of on-coming experience) to pleasant or unpleasant experience with grasping or aversion that past kamma is resolved, freedom from kamma attained. The first effort at putting this method into practice is usually accompanied by pain of withdrawl. The yearning to prolong the experience of pleasure, when denied, is painful; the urge to escape pain, when denied, is also initially painful. The ending of the old habit of reaction is painful, but it must be seen as a secondary pain. The Buddha gives as an example the painful sensations that accompany the curing of an injury caused by a poisoned arrow. It is this experience which is being mistakenly interpreted as the fee for freedom. It is not the fundamental fee for freedom. Not everyone will have such dues to pay. The fee for freedom is the non-reaction.</p>

					<p>In this sutta the Buddha outlines various views about the nature of the real, essential self and the world, past, future and present and points out that these views are all speculative and that for true satisfaction and liberation one must let go of all that which has been constructed, including speculative opinions.<br />
					As is suggested by Ms. Horner, this sutta should definately be read along with the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Brahmajāla-Suttanta.</a> It has some interesting differences. (I do not say 'contradictions.') Ms. Horner, here, as throughout her translation of the Majjhima relys heavily on the commentary. In the case of this sutta at least the commentary has tended to force an interpretation of what is being said where it would be better taken as it is given.</p>

					<h4><a id="p105">105</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm">Sunakkhatta Suttaɱ,</a> II.252</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha shows Sunakkhatta a path to Nibbana together with several similes to help illustrate his points.<br />
					The path is a very unusual one! Unique in the suttas. He takes Sunakkhatta from a point where he is interested in irrelevant issues like the accomplishments of certain bhikkhus, through abandoning sense pleasures, to 'unshakability', to The Realm of Nothing's Real, to the Realm of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception, to temporary Nibbana, to Nibbana.<br />
					Unshakability here may mean becoming a Stream-enterer, or it may mean someone who has attained the fourth jhana, it is not defined. It may just mean someone looking for conviction in something. The next sutta illustrates how this concept should be understood as a quality, not a destination.</p>

					<p>The Buddha elaborates a heierarchy of stages in the realization of Nibbana with unshakability as the initial point of entry, that is, Streamwinning.<br />
					A very important sutta in that it describes the stages of progress towards Nibbana not with the usual 'Streamwinner', 'Once-returner', 'Non-Returner', 'Arahant', but gives us a perspective on these by describing stages to Nibbana in terms of attainment of unshakability, the Realm of No-things-had, the Realm of Neither-perception-nor-non-perception, Crossing the Flood, and the Aristocratic Release.</p>

					<p>Ananda responds to questions about how the order can maintain harmony without a designated leader.<br />
					Bhikkhu Thanissaro's introduction to this sutta:<br />
					This discourse presents a picture of life in the early Buddhist community shortly after the Buddha's passing away. On the one hand, it shows the relationship between the monastic community and the political powers that be: the monks are polite and courteous to political functionaries, but the existence of this discourse shows that they had no qualms about depicting those functionaries as a little dense. On the other hand, it shows that early Buddhist practice had no room for many practices that developed in later Buddhist traditions, such as appointed lineage holders, elected ecclesiastical heads, or the use of mental defilements as a basis for concentration practice.</p>

					<p>The Buddha discourses on the qualities of the bad man and those of the good man.<br />
					This sutta, as well as describing the bad man and the good man, brings up the interesting idea that it is not possible for a bad man to "know" a bad man or a good man. The idea is that it is not possible for a person to see as a fault in another a fault he himself does not believe is a fault or a virtue he does not think is a virtue. I think this does not mean, for example, that the liar cannot tell another liar. He is just unable to see a fault in telling lies. In other words what he cannot see is not the fault, but the goodness or badness of the qualities. There are those who have faults they understand as faults and I think it does not contradict this sutta when we find that these persons are sometimes able to acknowledge in someone else the goodness that they do not themselves possess. Indeed this is a necessary pre-requisite for undertaking the effort at salvation taught by the Buddha.</p>

					<p>This Sutta describes how Sariputta attained the goal through tracking down the essential factors necessary for insight.<br />
					This is a very interesting and unique sutta as is evidenced by the number of translations we have. In it we find the details of the jhanas described in more than the usual detail, and we have the over-arching method which is: observation of the component parts of a mental state; tracing them back to their point of origin; following them back to their point of ending; drawing the conclusion that these are ending things and do not constitute that which is self or belonging to self; and then separating one's self from them, becoming detached. Probably the most instructive sutta when it comes to developing and using the jhanas to attain detachment.</p>

					<p>The questions that should be put to one who has stated that for him rebirth is left behind, lived is the best of lives, done is duty's doing, there is no more being any sort of an 'it' at any place of 'atness' left for him; i.e., he has declared arahantship.<br />
					Here the Buddha has specifically used this formula for declaring arahantship. This is possibly because the term Arahant was used at the time to designate an honorable (worthy) person other than an arahant. So by using this specific formula the exact meaning of the term in this context is unmistakable.<br />
					I believe the Olds translation is the first full translation of this sutta. The PTS and Bhks. Nanamoli and Bodi's  translations have abbreviations and both re-use previous translations of the last section whereas it contains differences from the previously translated Pali. Sister Upalavana's translation is linked. She often mangles English, but her predisposition is to accurate translation independant of the other translators and consulting her choices is sometimes helpful.</p>

					<p>The Buddha delivers three discourses in brief on the subject of how to judge whether or not something should be done or used or practiced or associated with. In each case Sariputta expands the brief discussion in detail and the Buddha confirms Sariputtas analysis.<br />
					Here, in the unabridged version we see the way the teaching was likely conducted. Not only does Sariputta expand the teaching in brief of the Buddha, but the Buddha then repeats what Sariputta has said, so the bhikkhus end up having heard the lesson three times.<br />
					Nit: Ms. Horner has translated 'vitthārena' as 'in full' but logic and tradition has it that the Buddha always speaks 'in brief' or 'in detail' (which is not the same thing as 'in full'. However lengthy a discourse may be, by the nature of the interlinking of doctrines it can be expanded limitlessly (see <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">The Method</a> on this site for an example of how this works), so that there is never any teaching 'in full'. Bhk. Bodhi has 'in detail'.</p>

					<p>The Buddha sings the praises of a number of paccekabuddhas.<br />
					This is a very old form of poetry. It consists, with a side-note her and there, of a list of ancient heros (seers) who were paccekabuddhas. The Paccekabuddha is an individual who became arahant without the aid of the Dhamma of a Buddha. Paccekabuddha, is often translated 'silent buddhas' and such are said to not teach. Since there are stories here and there showing that a paccekabuddha did teach, the better understanding is that these individuals had neither the training or the inclination to teach and lacked the charisma to lead groups.<br />
					A very old way of remembering the past practiced in Ancient Greece (where some teachers are reported to have memorized the entire contents of large libraries) and throughout the Ancient East, still practiced by some tribes in Africa. Before writing and the printing press, and the radio, and the TV and the computer and the i-phone, the mere recollection of a single word or name would bring to mind a much expanded story as handed down from generation to generation. In the Buddha's time it was expected that a person could at least remember the history of his family back seven generations on both sides. We see evidence in the udanas at the ends of chapters in the Pali of how this technique was used to memorize the entire collection of suttas before it was written down. Recently 'rediscovered' this memory enhansing method can now be found advertised on late night TV and on the Internet whence you can pay a hefty sum to learn to make associations in the mind.</p>

					<p>In this sutta the Buddha teaches that there is a misguided way and a high way and that the high way may be undertaken in a low way and a high way depending upon one's point of view, the direction of one's effort and the set of one's mind.In this sutta the Buddha teaches that there is a misguided way and a high way and that the high way may be undertaken in a low way and a high way depending upon one's point of view, the direction of one's effort and the set of one's mind.<br />
					Each factor of the Magga is, in this description of how to undertake the Dhamma, to be guided by high view, high effort and high mindfulness. These are defined. The Way in this sutta is described as having High knowledge <i>(ñāṇa)</i> and High Freedom (vimutti) as dimensions nine and ten.<br />
					Note in this sutta the definition of <i>'Sammā Diṭṭhi'</i> High View. It is on this sutta that a certain school of Buddhism holds that any effort at accomplishment is mundane practice and that there is nothing to do to attain the super-mundane practice. If they have any logic to their reasoning it is because this so-called supermundane practice is made up entirely of letting go. But letting go is still kamma, action, something to be done and often requires great effort just to get to the point where letting go is possible. I am of the belief that the intent in this sutta was not to suggest two separate paths, but to create awareness that if a practice is pursued with grasping the result will not be the liberation one saught. In practice one will tread both paths, first with grasping and then upon becoming aware of the grasping, with letting go.</p>

					Note: This sutta shows that minding the body is a complete path to Nibbana. Ms. Horner would have it that this sutta has been extracted from the Satipatthana.

					<p>The Buddha teaches how the intent to create experience for the self results in rebirth in accordance with the intent in a sequence that progresses from the intent to experience rebirth as a wealthy or powerful individual through a detailed list of gods to Arahantship.<br />
					Lord Chalmers here has both reverted to his previous translation of Sankhārā as 'plastic forces' and taken on to that the definition of it as being faith, virtue, instruction, munificence and understanding. This is not supported by the Pali. There is no 'these five Sankhārā' there. In the 'wherever are these Sankhārā' the 'these' refers back to the previous set (fixing his heart, setting his heart, training his heart in this translation). He confirms his error in the following cases but breaks down towards the end, using there 'qualities'. He is not alone in his confusion. Both Bhk. Bodhi and Ms. Horner's translations of Sankhārā change in this sutta. The confusion results from their original translations, which, say I, should always have followed the Pali etymology and been translated 'own-making' or at the least 'construction'.<br />
					This sutta needs to be fully unabridged for its full power to be manifest. It is not simply a set of formulas for attaining this or that rebirth. It is a sequence, it points out at each succeeding step a greater and more ambitious goal.</p>

					The brother of the previous fire and brimstone sermon. The thing, my friends, is not whether or not you believe there is a Hell or not; if there is, it will not matter what you believed. The only rational course is to behave as though there were. That way if there is, you are safe, if there is not at least here the wise will see you as having acted rationally.<br />

					A sutta which breaks down the logic behind the caution not to quickly draw generalizations from personal experience.<br />
					Note in this sutta that there is no question that an intentional deed produces the result as per the intention. It always does. What this means, however, should be understood not as meaning that the form or shape of the intended deed is the result, but that in accordance with the sensation intended to be produced by the action so is the deed experienced. A deed of thought, word, or body intended to cause pain, results in the experience of pain. The shape of that pain may vary from the shape taken by the deed.</p>

					<h4><a id="p142">142</a>. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.142.pali.bd.htm">Dakkhiṇa-Vibhaŋga Suttaɱ,</a> III.253</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha provides a scale for the expected kammic return on gifts to individuals and gifts to the Order in it's various forms.<br />
					A sutta for those wishing to calculate their kammic savings account. Note here is a sutta which explicitly states that gifts given 'to the Saŋgha' are superior in yield even to that of a gift given to a Buddha. It is very important that one wishing to make such a gift state this at the time the gift is being given. Otherwise the kammic result is that of a gift given to an individual. The formula goes something like this: "Please accept this gift to the Saŋgha from me, as a favour to me." For a detailed discussion of giving in general see <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/beginners_questions/advantage_giver.htm">Advantage Giver</a> in the <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dt_toc.htm">Forum Archives.</a><br />
					There is also a discussion in this sutta of 'purification' of gifts by either the giver or the recipient. What does it mean that 'an offering is purified'? The potency of an action is relative to the detachment of the giver and the receiver. It is as though a certain amount of the energy in the deed is held back or weakened by the attachment of either the giver or receiver thus diminishing the kammic consequence or creative force it would have if left free. But the encumbered deed can aparently be restored to it's full potential (? or at least can have it's potential boosted; purification does not necessarily mean that a thing has become wholly pure; the sutta is, after all, giving us in effect, gradations of detachment in individuals) by the degree of detachment of one or the other or both the giver and the receiver. The 'sila' and 'kalya-dhamma', the 'ethical conduct' and 'lovely-manners' are in this sutta the indicators of the detachment of the individual. So for example, a gift given by one of poor moral habit (just to choose something likely to be familiar to the reader) is purified to a certain degree by a recipient of good moral habit, to a greater degree by one striving after Stream-entry, and to still higher degrees by those further along the path.</p>
