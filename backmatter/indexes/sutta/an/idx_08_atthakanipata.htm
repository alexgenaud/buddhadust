Sakka visits Uttara and asks him if the saying was original with him and Uttara replies that whatsoever is well said is heard from the Buddha. Sakka then repeats to him the entire episode of it's original utterance by Gotama in AN 8.7. and commends him to remember it as an integral factor in the holy life.</p>

						<p>The story of the conversion of <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/siha.htm">Sīha, the Lacchavi general</a> who was formerly a disciple of the Niganthas.<br />
						An elucidation of the distinctions to be made when applying terms descriptive of Gotama's system "A doctrine of inaction, a doctrine of action, a doctrine of annihilation, a doctrine of abhorrence, a doctrine of abolition, a doctrine of mortification, a docrine against rebirth, a doctrine of consolation." At the meal provided by General Siha after his conversion the issue of eating meat came up and we see a clear illustration of the intent of the rule allowing meat to be eaten if it was not known or suspected to have been killed specifically for one. The General has ordered that meat was to be obtained from an animal that was already butchered. This is comparable to purchasing meat on display in a supermarket today. There is no adverse kamma from either the purchase or the eating of such meat. There is also in this sutta the strange statement by the General that he would not kill a living being even for his life's sake. Perhaps he was retired.</p>

						<p>An elegant sutta describing the instructions given Anuruddha which lead to his becoming an arahant. Also useful as an instruction as to how to attain the <i>jhānas.</i>  There is also a deep lesson here on the use of psychic power. Gotama first visits Anuruddha by way of 'astral travel' (giving him by this a shock to his system to bring his higher mental powers into play) having overheard him with his supernatural hearing, congratulates him on his thoughts (the seven thoughts of a Great Man), rehearses them with him and instructs him in the attainment of the <i>jhānas,</i> and upon returning rehearses the whole lesson in detail with the bhikkhus. The thing to 'see' is Anuruddha 'hearing' as Gotama rehearses the seven thoughts in detail with the bhikkhus. In this sutta (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.030.hare.pts.htm#pg158">page 158</a>) there is a definition of set up 'sati' (upaṭṭhitasati) the state achieved by 'satipaṭṭhana' (the setting up of sati) which should be noted by everyone practicing that method, that is (Hare's translation): <i>'he is endowed in the highest degree with intentness of mind and discrimination; he <b>recollects and calls to mind both the doings and the sayings of long ago'</b></i> or as in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/07_sevens/an07.004.hare.pts.htm#pg3">AN 7.4 pg 3</a>: <i>'he minds and reminds'.</i> — Whereas mindfulness and paying attention are aspects of the practice of setting up sati, the state achieved does not put the emphasis on 'attention' but on the memory. For 'paying attention' we have '<a href="../../../../dhammatalk/method/self-defense.htm">guarding the senses.</a>' So the practice of one who has mastered these two basics is: paying attention to the events occuring at the doors of the senses and using the memory to evaluate those events to the point where they are seen as transient, essentially painful, and not-self at which point there is serenity (<i>samādhi,</i> the peace of detachment) and recognizing this detachment as freedom, freedom. The information is here. The method is well taught. What should be done for you by a teacher, friends, has been done. Getting something from that is up to you. Find your place to be alone, meditate! Do not regret hereafter!</p>

Form an 'aspiration' this way: "Let me (or 'May I'), as a consequence of this gift, be reborn among ..." These are all rebirths for those whose minds 'are set on lower things.'

						<p>Eight essential factors in the observation of the Buddhist Sabbath with an explanation of why this practice is so fruitful.<br />
						Very interesting from the point of view of the comparative life-spans of some of the gods above the human realm. In this we have an anticipation by about 2500 years of Einstein's Theory of Relativity ... adding some things Einstein didn't think of. Combine this with an understanding that the Paticca Samuppada anticipates quantum physics and whole new worlds of possibilities open up ... But not so long as we have the seven-day work week throwing off the natural rhythm of life as would be lived according to lunar and solar time. In balance with the cosmos, one can see into the cosmos, find one's place, achieve balance; off balance, the sight of man is continually seeking just to find balance. We see the result of that in the focus on the buck. Organize the calendar according to the convenience of the merchant in the seven-day work-week and the mind naturally concludes that the goal of the merchant (the buck) is the source of balance in the world. Think of the ramifications in terms of health, status, power, satisfaction.</p>

						<p>Six factors which, depending on their presence or absense in a person in eight combinations make for sufficiency in being of benefit to either the self or others or both. This sutta has two characteristics which are interesting. First is that it is another of the sort which come across as mental exercises: it really stretches the attention to keep track. I really hope that seeing some of these suttas completely rolled out brings home this idea that what we have here in this sort of sutta is an enjoyable challenging way to learn Dhamma ... not to mention the benefits in strengthening the memory. The second characteristic found in this sutta is the fact that it is one which is very encouraging to even those whose grasp of the Dhamma is somewhat slender while at the same time points to the path to improvement.</p>

						<p>A bhikkhu asks for a lesson 'in brief' and gets a lesson in detail. A truly unique sutta which leads to arahantship by a complex mixing of the four <i>brahma viharas,</i> and <i>samādhi</i> practice in the context of <i>satipatthana</i> training. A good sutta to break up the rigid understanding of <i>samādhi</i> and <i>satipaṭṭhana</i> practice.<br />
						This is a very interesting sutta because it gives a step-by-step instruction in meditation practice. It is notable here that while the factors of <i>jhāna</i> are stated, they are all just classed under <i>'samādhi'</i> ('serenity'; Hare, Bhk. Thanisaro, Bhk. Bodhi: 'concentration') and are not put in the usual 1-4 grouping and the term <i>'jhāna'</i> is not mentioned. The method for transitioning out of <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> is inidicated here in a way that is only found in a few suttas: that is, by abandoning one, then the other. Also interesting in this sutta is the way serenity practice is combined with the <i>satipaṭṭānās</i>.</p>

						<p>A valuable sutta for those interested in the development of the 'Devine Eye' or clairvoyance. Gotama provides a step-by step progression from the seeing of vague lights, to seeing the forms of beings, to associating with them and conversing with them, to learning of various sorts of information about them to knowing whether or not one had one's self at some time been one of them.<br />
						This is also a detailed presentation of the cultivation of serenity based on 'light' which is said to be the samadhi most conducive to yielding knowledge and vision. Begin by 'looking at' the vague lights one sees when the eyes are partially closed. Without thinking about the lights, track the lights. The best practice is to not 'focus down,' but to repeatedly glance at, as  one does not generally 'focus down' on things in normal seeing, but glances at things. (Wisdom of Don Juan) Overcome the obstacle of delight or surprise, or fear, or attachment to the phenomena or pride in the accomplishment when the vague lights become clearly distinguishable shapes, when the shapes become beings, when the beings become pictures, when the pictures become stories, etc.<br />
						The Hare translation made the best of a confused PTS Pali which was, as we have it, abridged without so indicating and was a mess, the BJT Pali was similarly messed up. I have put the Pali into the form I believe was originally intended and have reconstructed Hare's translation accordingly. You've been told.</p>

						<p>The Buddha states that he is able to extend his lifespan to the end of the evolution of the world. He states this three times but Ananda does not take the hint to ask him to do so. Mara rejoyces but overplays his hand, pushing for the Buddha to enter PariNibbana immediately. The Buddha tells Mara not to be impatient for he will do so within three months thereby renouncing the remainder of his lifespan possible. At this statement there is a world-shaking earthquake. Then Ananda asks about the causes of such earthquakes and Gotama explains the eight causes. A hard sutta for those grounded in modern science to accept. An interesting thing in this regard is the description of the first cause of such a quake which is more or less what we might call a 'normal' quake. In this it is stated that the earth is situated (stands) on water, the water on air and that when the air becomes disturbed, it disturbes the water which disturbes the earth. Our history books record the idea of the earth being on water as ancient ignorant myth. But if the translation of 'water' is it's other meaning as 'liquid' and if the translation of 'air' is as it's other meaning as 'motion'. We could then see that the statement is that the earth's mantal rests on liquid and that when such things as solar flairs and cosmic winds disturb the magnetic field ... . Well ... the scientists will immediately say that it isn't the liquid strata that causes quakes, but the plates rubbing against each other. But what causes their movement? I know! I know! It's the movements of those turtles. The other causes are much more mystical. ... but what causes the solar winds? Etc. </p>

						<p>A stepwise method of progression from faith to arahantship. Identical with AN 8.71 above but with the deliverances substituted for the four jhanas. What is the significance of this? First one must understand that the deliverances are not 'the final deliverance' as in Nibbana. In both the case of the jhanas and the deliverances, Nibbana is attained upon conscious realization of liberation. Upekkah (detachment), or the fourth jhana (or any state of detachment above involvement with sense pleasures), or the perception of the ending of sense experience, are in and of themselves not enough. The factors that would bring such detached or liberated states to an end and result in re-entry or rebirth, that is, the <i>āsavas,</i> or corrupting influences, must be brought to and end and seen to have been completely eliminated. So what is being said in these suttas is that one uses the detached state of the jhana, or the released state of the deliverances, first working on the ending of the asavas and then attaining freedom from them, and realizing one has got free, one is free.</p>
