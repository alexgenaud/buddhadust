						<p>Covering #s 8,9, and 10. Three suttas which describe a stepwise method of progression from faith to arahantship. Each slightly different. Since each purports to be a path to Arahantship an equivalence is implied. Your homework is to see if you can see the equivalence. Another challenge is to rationalize the fact that here one sacred cow is left out, there another. For example the Eightfold Path is omitted in all but one of these methods, the <i>jhānas</i> are included in only one. The trick is to let go of any tendency to hang on unyieldingly to terminology while simultaneously being so precise in one's thinking that nothing essential to the process is missing.<br />
						The Pali is abridged in a way which allows for multiple versions of the missing sections. The BJT has a briefer version than the one used here. The Woodward expansion is based on the more verbose version (based on his suggestion in a footnote).</p>

						<p>Ten similes extolling the virtues of carefulness (appamada).<br />
						The term to understand here is <i>'appamāda'</i>: A = non; PAMĀDA = carelessness. One of the most frequently occuring concepts in the whole of the Pali Cannon. This word is a mantra. A magical word which if concentrated upon, repeatedly pronounced to the point where it induces a hypnotic trance, opens up to reveal the memory embedded in it's creation. A memory which goes far beyond the admittedly valuable idea of being cautious.</p>

						<p>Some bhikkhus are asked that since both they and the Buddha teach a goal of understanding all things, what is the difference between the two systems. The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that when this question is asked the response should be: 'The 10 Questions' (Giving them in full as found in this sutta).<br />
						This is a subtle response to this question in that The 10 Questions is a broad and deep exposition to the 10th power of how everything in the world is to be let go. Each of 'the 10' is a complete path to utter detachment seen from a different perspective. A sutta no serious student of the Dhamma should neglect!

						<p>In an alternate version of the Great 10 Questions, the Kajaŋgala bhikkhunī expands the questions given in brief to a group of lay followers. Her version contains a few answers that differ from those given in the previous sutta [<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.027.wood.pts.htm">AN 10 27</a>]. This is the set of ten questions on which much of <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/title_page.htm">The Pali Line</a> (the introductory course in the Buddhism of the Pali Suttas recommended here) is based. These ten questions can be used in much the same way as the kasina, or concentration device, as a 'theme' of practice. In each individual case it is explicitly stated that thorough comprehension leads to 'the end of dukkha' or Arahantship. The actual experience is that one sees how each of these is of such a nature as to encompass all the rest ... and all the other doctrines of the system.<br />
						It is important to note that there are several versions of the ten questions. They are all equally valid in terms of their scope and use. Numerous other sets could be constructed by reviewing the whole of the Anguttara Nikaya.</p>

						<p>Raja Pasenadi pays a visit to the Buddha and shows great respect and enumerates the reasons for his great respect. Woodward notes that this sutta contains statements that would not likely have been known to Raja Pasenadi. This seems an obvious case of tampering by early compilers. Compare this sutta with <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.089.horn.pts.htm">MN 89 Horner</a> (the much more likely true story). The issue for us is: does it matter? As far as the doctrines contained in the sutta they have no inconsistency with their counterparts in the rest of the suttas (they are in fact mostly verbatim pick-ups). It is distasteful to our sensabilities that the editors should make an explicit claim that this was a true sutta when the fact is insupportable, but the reality is that story telling tradition has always been very liberal in such matters ... right on up to today. In any case, what we should not do is 'throw the baby out with the bath water' and disregard the Dhamma within the sutta as not-dhamma because of a liberty taken by an editor.</p>

						<p>Mahāli asks the Buddha about the reasons for bad and good deeds. In a very interesting post-script to the direct answer that it is is as a consequence of lust, hatred, delusion, not noticing the beginnings of things, and following wrong views and the reverse of these five, he further states that without these ten things there would be no wrong or deviant living or right or straight living. In other words these things amount to the sum total of what is needed to be done in the system to attain it's goals. No mention of the Magga. In other other words, the Magga is a method for eliminating the first five of these things, so instruction can be given in these two general ways: either by stating the things to be eliminated or by stating the method to eliminate them. The choice, presumably being made based on the listener's inclination and capabilities. Once a request was made for an instruction in brief where the response simply stated: "Whatsoever has to do with hunger (<i>taṇhā</i>), know that is not Dhamma."</p>

						<p>The Buddha spirs on the bhikkhus warning them not only to guard against backsliding but also against accepting the status quo, admonishing the bhikkhus to examine themselves for faults and then to make a strong effort to get rid of any faults found; this as a key to the comprehension of their hearts. (Ending as with the two prevous suttas). It is interesting that here he is speaking of a person who has faith, virtue, much knowledge, the habit of casting off things, wisdom and quick wits. One might think this was pretty good, but the warning is not to be complacent even with relatively high accomplishments. This is a monster of a mountain that must be climbed!</p>

						<p>The Buddha gives two criteria for evaluating the knowledge of one's own heart: attainment of higher wisdom and insight into Dhamma, and calm of heart; and then he gives a method for judging the right course to take with regard to clothing, food, location and persons.<br />
						This is an invaluable sutta with regard to day-to-day practice.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi has translated <i>'Samatha'</i> as 'serenity'; Woodward uses 'peace'; Bhk. Thanissaro uses 'tranquility. <i>'Samatha'</i> is a term that both encompasses and is subordinate to <i>'samādhi'</i>. It stands for the general goal of the calm necessary for unbiased vision of things the way they really are, and it is the practice of stilling, calming and tranquilizing the body in preparation for samādhi. What is required for this word then, is one that implies the general idea of calm (applicable to both body and mind, or as here, heart), plus the specific idea of calm of body. 'Serenity' is more of a mental quality. It is the idea of being calmly above it all. Therefore I suggest that for <i>'samatha'</i> we use 'calm' or 'tranquility'; and reserve 'serenity' for <i>'samādhi.'</i></p>

If a person doesn't listen, forgets what he has heard, teachings formerly memorized are not rehearsed, and he has no intuitive understanding he tends to wane; if he listens, remembers what he has heard, rehearses formerly memorized teachings, and cultivates intuitive knowledge he tends not to wane.</p>

						<p>The Buddha reveals ten perceptions which are very helpful to seekers. I did a translation of this sutta so that we would have here a contrast with Woodward's translation. There is an enormous difference when <i>'sannā'</i> is translated 'perception' rather than 'idea'. <i>Sannā</i> = 'one-knowing' or 'first-knowing' or 'once-knowing' = perception, not idea. The difference is that an idea is an abstract thing, tending to suggest an intellectual understanding apart from the perception of it being something connected to the self (speaking conventionally, or, rather, since these things are 'helps along the way', speaking with regard to the identification with 'this being'); here the idea is to have actually seen these things as they manifest themselves to one's self... actually seeing, or smelling, or tasting the identical repulsion one has of excrementia, in some otherwise delightful food for example, or the actual feeling of world-wearyness when some ambition arises, or the conscious recognition of release (a deep sigh of relief that feels like it is the first full breath one has had in a long time ... which it is) when one has finally passed the withdrawl stage connected with some habitual practice one has let go.</p>

						<p>The Buddha reveals ten perceptions which are very helpful to seekers.<br />
						This sutta while including some of the perceptions from the previous sutta, adds a few that are in need of a little explanation. Perception of bones, larva, mal-coloration, swelling. These ideas are generally associated in the commentaries with the use of concentration devices (specifically those of observing a corpse). That has the tendency to create the same distance from them as does the use of 'idea' in the translation. These are 'live' perceptions. One sees in one's mind's eye, as clearly as in a vivid dream, maggots heaving around, as often as not within 'one's own' or some live person's body, or one sees all mankind as a mess of maggots roiling around in some open wound, not just in the body of a corpse one is using as a concentration device. One sees a repulsive swelling or bruising in ordinary objects and people, or one sees ordinary objects and people as just a repulsive swelling. Again, in the mind's eye, one perceives this whole universe as a disgusting skeleton, or one sees right into the bones of some person or sees some person as simply a walking skeleton. Woodward does not comment, Bhk. Bodhi has these as perceptions of corpses. The Pali has these as stand-alone concepts; not connected to corpses. The distinction points out the utility: the kasina (observing a corpse) is used to stimulate the perception. The end result is not the perception of these things in a corpse, but the application of the perception of these things to everyday experience, they serve to make one aware on a gut level of the reality of things. One uses the recollection of these perceptions to counter lust or other disadvantageous feelings that have arisen. They instill sobriety.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches ten important ideas by posing them as questions that might be asked of Buddhists by outsiders. There is an interesting manipulation of the term 'dhamma' here which illustates it's dual meaning as 'thing' and 'Form' (in the sense of 'Good Form') or 'The Teaching.' This translation of 'Dhamma' as 'Good Form' comes from the discussion of the term in Rhys David's <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.015.asoka.htm#pg292">Buddhist India pg 292</a> where he points to the etymological root as "identical with the Latin <i>forma</i>" our 'form'. This serves very well for this word where it must stand for 'thing' and is a synonym for <i>'rūpa'</i> (often translated 'form') in this sense, and also for 'the best way to do a thing', or 'Good Form'. This use for 'form' is found in asian cultures where the idea is exactly that there is a perfectly correct and efficient way to do even the smallest things. The expression 'Doing Forms' is also used as the English translation for the term in asian martial arts that stands for various groups of moves in practice routines. At this time the word 'Dhamma' for Gotama's teaching is relatively well known here and it will probably stick, but there is confusion that results when the word must be used for 'things' and ... 'Good form' in general.</p>

						<p>The Buddha gives definitions for 'The Ten Perceptions': The idea of discontinuity, of not-self, of the foul, of disadvantages, letting go, dispassion, ending, world-wearyness, of discontinuity in the own-made, of recollection of respriration. In this sutta is a case of 'curing' by way of hearing the Dhamma. Also in this sutta is found a version of what would later become the Satipatthana method.<br />
						In this sutta Bhk. Bodhi translates <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> both as 'conditioned phenomena' and as 'activities'. The first is simply incorrect (all own-made phenomena are impermanent, but not all conditioned phenomena are impermanent: Nibbana is conditioned), the second is one-sided and too narrow, the two together are confusing.

						<p>In the technique of the Paticca Samuppada, the Buddha traces out how hunger to exist rolls on through blindness and the way freedom from it is managed. Almost identical with the previous sutta, but beginning with thirst for existence (Woodward's 'craving-to-become').<br />
						Together these bracket the first condition of the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada:</i> <i>Avijjā paccayo saŋkhārā.</i> [see for example <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.001.pali.bd.htm#p1.3">SN2.12.001</a>] Blindness (Woodward's 'Ignorance') results in own-making. On one side it answers the question: 'then what is it that results in blindness?' And on the other side it answers the question as to why blindness results in own-making.<br />
						Another thing is that since <i>'taṇhā,'</i> thirst, (Woodward's 'craving'), results in the usual first condition of the <i>paṭicca samuppada,</i> 'blindness', and is also a 'condition' following sense experience within the formula, we can see by this that the <i>paṭicca samuppada</i> is to be taken as a series of what Bhk. Thanissaro has called 'feedback loops' and should not be taken exclusively as a direct-line analysis. An interesting comparison could be made to the Mandelbrot Set, where, at any point along a series a new series could be begun, and so on without end.</p>

						<p>Almost identical to the previous sutta except that here Gotama asserts that all those who have unwavering faith in him are Streamwinners. Something to consider for those insisting that there can be no stream-entry without breaking <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#FundamentalAttachments">the first three samyojanas</a>. The catch is of course the 'unwavering' part. It is an easy thing to say one has unwavering faith in something when one has studied it for years or decades or practiced it a little with good results, but this is a wide world and the mind is organized in hierarchies and unless the person has crossed the line marked by the 'dhamma eye': "<i><b>all things</b></i> that have come into existence are destined to come to an end" the mind which had latched onto faith through fear (not a high level in the hierarchy) could find a greater satisfaction in someone dying on the cross for their sins, for example, or in the idea that there was no self, or in the idea that this was a one-shot thing and there was no possibility of having to pay up, than in concepts such as compassion, giving or ethical behavior ... themselves not high up in the pecking order. In fact, faith based on such things is one of the three things that the usual definition of the streamwinner suggests must be broken. Still the possibility exists that a person with no more than a faith that the Buddha taught a way to freedom, or a way to the end of pain, might tenaceously hold on to that faith at death and that tenacious hanging on could drag them into a rebirth where their faith could find growth and develop into knowledge and vision, so it is a true statement to say it can be done by faith alone.<br />
						One more thing: there was a point not too far back where many of those of us who had faith in Gotama's teaching were trying to make the idea of faith sound palatable to a population heartily disenchanted with a faith that depended on faith that had proved incapable of inspiring it's leaders to remain on the path of righteousness, so to speak. There was a big effort to convince everyone that faith in Buddhism was not faith, but 'confidence' [e.g. Bhk. Bodhi in his translation of this sutta] or 'conviction' [Bhk. Thanissaro] or 'trust' or 'well-reasoned or grounded trust' [me], but here the plain fact of the case is that this sutta is speaking about blind faith and I think we need to accept the fact that there is this level of trust, conviction and confidence in Gotama and his system as well and that it is not without good results. There are those of us who would like to think of Gotama's system as mathematically pure science, which it is, but we need also to recognze that there are those who have blind faith even in pure mathematics, and that it is not therefore a danger to the system that there are such believers. ... it's when a person has confidence and conviction that their blind faith is well grounded and starts proselytizing that the trouble starts, but that is another story.</p>

						<p>The Buddha enumerates 10 qualities of a crow which are found also in a wicked bhikkhu. This is a sutta which must be read in the Pali to see the humor. You can do it! It's very short, and the humor can be easily seen. And you will never forget the Pali word for 'and'. In this sutta and the next there is the use of the word "Dhamma" that falls between the meaning as 'phenomena' or 'thing' and The Dhamma, as in the Teachings of the Buddha.

						<p>The Buddha suggests ten thoughts as counter-weights to the arising of anger possible from ten situations where anger might arise (those of the previous sutta). Our version of the BJT Pali was incomplete for this and the previous sutta. This may have been corrected, but readers of that version should check. Woodward and Bhks. Thanissaro and Bodhi have trouble with the phrase: <i>taṃ kut'ettha labbhā' ti?</i> 'What is to be gained from that?' The meaning is understood if <i>kamma</i> is kept in mind. The idea is to calm one's tendency to an angry reaction by remembering that this deed this fellow does will return to him and that therefore there is no need to seek vengence from a feeling of outrage at injustice.</p>

						<p>Punniya, asks why it is that sometimes the Buddha will teach and sometimes not. Gotama explains that there are ten factors involved, but that more than the simple ten factors what is needed is to see progress up the ten factors in a bhikkhu. So sometimes a teaching may be given with only some of the factors and other times not when even one is missing. This is the experience of the modern practitioner of the system as well: it gets more demanding the further into it one gets.

						<p>A well-known sutta describing the horrific result of hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna by the Kokālikan Monk. This sutta has in it the mention of a <i>'paccekabrahmā.'</i> Bhk. Bodhi, in a footnote, cites Spk-pṭ I 213 (VRI ed) commenting on <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.06.010.rhyc.pts.htm">SN I 146</a>, as explaining this as "a brahmā who travels about alone, not as a member of an assembly". This possibly throws some light on the term <i>'pacceka-buddha'</i> which is usually translated 'silent-buddha' or as Woodward has translated it here for the brahmā, 'Individual-'. This term, when applied to a Buddha, means an individual who attained Arahantship without the aid of another awakened individual but who has not the training or charisma or inclination or opportunity to lead a following. There is also here another visit to Gotama by Brahmā Sahampati.<br />
						One other interesting thing in this sutta is the case of a non-returner returning to this world for a visit. We need, in thinking of the non-returner in order not to make the mistake made by Kokalika, to think in terms of rebirth, not freedom of movement. [For another case of a Non-returner returning to this world for a visit see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.125.wood.pts.htm">AN 3.125</a>.]</p>

						<p>Gotama speaks to the wealthy banker <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm"><span class="mozp">Anāthapiṇḍika</span></a>, breaking down the distinctions between sorts of persons who are still enjoyers of sense pleasures according to the extent they earn their wealth legitimately and dispense with it wisely.<br />
						Mark Twain used to do a routine where he would stand in front of his audience and tell a feeble, possibly even tedious joke or story. When he got no reaction from the audience except embarrassment, he told the story again without altering a word or changing an inflection. He would repeat this routine as many times as necessary to bring the house down with laughter. It never failed.<br />
						My father used to tell the story of a comedian who would enter a bare stage with only a wooden chair on it, sit on the chair, and do nothing more until bit by bit there would be a snicker from someone in the audience, or a smile, and before long this non-act would bring the house down with laughter. It never failed.<br />
						There is something about repetition (or it's alter-ego, nothing at all happening, as with the experience of those who seek solitude) that, if endured to a certain point (passed a murkey sloth), forces the mind into an elevated state, wakes it up to a grander scope.<br />
						It is just this sort of psychology that is being used by Gotama in the case of this and so many other suttas considered 'tedious' by translators and readers today [Wednesday, December 18, 2013 10:07 AM]. The reader may be given some slack. The written word carries little or none of the magic of a live performance. But the reader must accept his disadvantage and make up for it with imagination. Dwell on such a sutta as this. Place yourself in the situation as you imagine it happening at the time. It will come to life. It never fails.<br />
						Something important for translators to remember in this regard is to not yield to the impulse to change the wording for variety. Follow the Pali. The Pali is mathematically consistent, and this is a necessity for the mind to keep track of the variations in the pattern. Inserting difference to break tedium destroys the pattern in exactly the same way as if when weaving a rug one were to alter the pattern simply because it was the same all round. Translators may think they are helping the reader, but they are breaking the spell and this is all the greater crime because it is not suspected that there is a spell there that is being broken and the changes make it much more difficult to discover. This is just as much the case in the case of the whole body of suttas, but is very difficult and has not been managed to this point by any translator. A uniform translation vocabulary across all the suttas should be made the goal of the next generation of Dhamma translators.</p>

						<p>Gotama explains to <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm"><span class="mozp">Anāthapiṇḍika</span></a> how one may know with certainty that one is a Streamwinner and that one has passed beyond the reach of certain unpleasant forms of rebirth and is assured of eventual awakening. The careful reader can see in this sutta how development of ethical behavior leads to unwavering faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Saŋgha which leads to insight into the method.<br />
						The term translated 'Guilty Dread' by woodward and 'fear and animosity' by Bhk. Thanissaro and 'perils and emnities' by Bhk. Bodhi is <i>bhayāni verāni. bhayāni</i> = fear, fright, dread; <i>verāni</i> = hatred, revenge, hostile action. A possible better translation is 'fear of retribution', which is what makes up guilty dread and is the peril of emnity and the fear of animosity. These actions are perils and do produce emnities and fear and animosity both in the doer and in others, but the issue in this sutta is a condition for knowing that one is a streamwinner and that condition is the absense of or allaying of <i>bhayāni verāni.</i> within. It has nothing to do with what may result externally from these actions.<br />
						This is a good sutta to contrast with <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.064.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.64</a> where faith alone is being spoken of as a condition for stream-entry. It should be noted here that in both cases there is no mention of breaking the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>saŋyojana</i></a>. That is not to say they are not broken, but only to point out that the formal terminology is not used and because of that there is the possibility of flexible understanding of the conditions. Possessing the four limbs of Stream-winning would be the breaking of doubt and wavering <i>(vicikiccha)</i>; true insight into 'the method' would be the breaking of the 'one truth view' <i>(sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i> (usually translated in terms meaning 'own-self-view': 'Person-pack-view' 'views on individuality' etc., my translation, points to the idea that it is getting rid of holding any view concerning the existence of anything that is the necessary meaning in that holding on to a view concerning the existence of anything is a projection of the idea of self, but perhaps that is going farther than is necessary, or even confusing the issue) <i>and</i> attachment to the view that the goal was reachable through giving, ethical conduct, or rituals <i>(sīlabbataparāmāso)</i>. One can imagine (or experience) a situation where one or some or all of these conditions are only partially met here, but where with faith in the Dhamma, or in the idea that Gotama achieved Awakening, or in the idea that there were those who had advanced towards the goal, upon death or upon the subsequent rebirth they come to fulfillment. That person would by that faith and partial accomplishment reasonably be called a stream-winner. On the other hand, that person would not be able to state with absolute conviction, that he was a stream-winner. Hopefully reflecting on this sutta would, in that case, inspire greater effort.</p>

						<p>Anāthapiṇḍika visits wanderers of other views, listens to their views and shows the wanderers how, in each case, the view is just a grasping after security based on something theoretical, made up, and which will lead to pain. When asked about his own views he responds that it is a not-clinging to things that are graspings after security based on things theoretical, made up, and which will lead to pain. This sutta amounts to a statement by Anāthapiṇḍika that he was at this time a stream-winner who <i>'knew and saw'</i>, one who had the Dhamma-eye: That all things that have come to be come to an end. After his death he was pronounced a Non-returner by Gotama.</p>

						<p class="in1"><b>&#35;<a id="p95" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/10_tens/an10.095.pali.bd.htm">95: Uttiya Suttaɱ,</a> V.193</b></p>
						
						<p>Uttiya the wanderer asks Gotama what he says about ten well-known questions concerning existence and non-existence each of which is answered by the statement by the Buddha that he has not made a declaration concerning the truth of that issue. Two additional question are: What then do you teach? and Will everyone be saved by this teaching?<br />
						The ten questions are the ones made famous by those who say that Gotama did not answer certain questions. That statement is a careless reading and mistaken. Here we see Gotama has not not answered the questions, he has answered by saying that he has not made an assertion of the truth or falsity of the proposition. This is not the same thing as not answering. If pressed for his reason for not making a declaration, (which Uttiya does not do in this sutta) Gotama explains that such questions are all based on points of view and consequently are true under only some ways of looking at things, false under others. Consequently if asked the simple question 'is this true?' there is no possible answer but that no one-sided declaration can be made about such an issue. Since with regard to the ten questions Gotama is being asked directly (that is, he is not being asked at this point what he has to say in general about this point of view) and only about his opinion as to the truth or falsity of the view, his only possible truthful answer is that he has not made a declaration (one way or the other) on that issue. When Uttiya askes about what Gotama does teach, he gets the other answer supplied to those who ask such questions: what he teaches, avoiding issues of existence and non-existence, is Pain, the origin of Pain, the ending of Pain and the way to the ending of pain. (Stated in different terms in this sutta ... which is a notable fact in itself: no mention of the four truths or the eightfold way.)<br />
						This may look like nit picking, but it is of vital concern as it is a pivotal point for the mind. (It also demonstrates how the awakened mind listens to and responds to questions!) Comprehension of why these are not fruitful inquiries leads to comprehension of the middle way and how it solves the problem of the Pain associated with existence.<br />
						For translators also it is vital. Not comprehending this balance between issues of existence and non-existence, translations will tend to use terms bound up in those very issues (e.g. 'no self' for <i>anatta:</i> which is, correctly, 'non-self') and by that not point to freedom.</p>

That is particularly unfortunate here as what we have from the beginning of this chapter (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.113.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.113</a> on) is otherwise a good example of what was a regular pattern in the dissemination of an approach to the Dhamma. First comes the doctine stated in brief by Gotama. Then comes one or more orthodox expansions by Gotama. Then comes a statement in brief to bhikkhus who then seek out the expansion from one of the elders. There is further evolution as in the next suttas, in some cases with the expansion being given by more than one elder, and sometimes with acceptable variations. Those interested in the history and methods of propagation of the Dhamma should take note.</p>

						<p>The Buddha defines a path which heaps up rebirth and a path that is beyond heaping up rebirth. PED has <i>'apacaya'</i> as 'unmaking' or 'diminishing' which is also the way Woodward (diminishing) and Bhk. Bodhi (dismantling) translate. PED forms the word from <i>'apa + ci"</i> 'up passed-whatever.' A simpler reading would be that the root is <i>'caya'</i> 'heap' and the prefixes are <i>'ā'</i> 'to' and <i>'apa'</i> 'up-passed.' The importance is in whether or not what is being said is that the path dismantles the existing pile of future rebirths, or does not create any new future rebirths. It works both ways.</p>

						<p>The Buddha answers Brahmin Sangaravo's inquiry about what is the hither shore and what is the further shore. Similar to <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.117.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.117</a> with a different explanation. Suggested theory about this sort of sutta: (that is a sutta in which some individual asks a question and gets an answer and then at another point asks the same question and gets a different answer — or, as with the following sutta, where an explanation of some point is made in one way at one time and in another way at another time). It happens frequently. The hypothesis is that it was a sort of game played by Gotama, possibly also by the questioner. Could the listener figure out that the two different responses were equivalants (or would he think Gotama was inconsistent?); could Gotama remember his previous response; could he come up with a variation that was an equivalant to the previous answer; how was it equivalent. Whether this hypothesis is correct or not it makes a good exercise in ones comprehension to try to see the equivalence.</p>

						<p>The Buddha states that both what is and what is not good form and the goal should be understood and then retires to his cell. The bhikkhus ask Maha Kacccana to elaborate. Maha Kaccana enumerates ten general areas to be considered good form and which are the goal and ten which are not good form and which are not the goal. Similar to <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.115.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.115</a> but using the heart of the previous suttas as the explanation. If you can get passed the doubt injected by the theory that these repetitions were invented by the early editors and 'could never have been uttered by Gotama', and can get over the bored reaction to them, you can see here a great game going on. How does MahaKaccana know that this time this set of explanations is to be used rather than the previous set? The Arahant is sitting around waiting for his time to be up, he has no interest in worldly activities to fill the time remaining, he is 'living in the Dhamma'. These games serve to teach others, preserve the Dhamma, and provide a pleasant, even challenging pastime.</p>

						<p>Brahmin Janussoni asks about the effacasy of offerings to the dead. He is given the criteria based on which such offerings are beneficial to the departed and also to the doner. The explanation is that such gifts are of benefit only to those reborn in the realm of petas (the so-called 'hungry ghosts'). Asked again who would benefit if no relative were reborn there Gotama replies that it is impossible that no relative would be reborn there, but that in any case there is benefit to the giver and he enumerates a number of cases. There are many people in the world, maybe not so many in the U.S., that are very concerned about making their departed relatives happy. For them this should be a very interesting sutta.</p>

						<p>The Buddha contrasts twelve pairs of persons in accordance to whether they are following the low path or the high path. This sutta is counted as twelve suttas in Be and Ce which is followed by Bhk. Bodhi; the BJT (apparently a version of Ce expanded and edited to closely follow the PTS) has this as one sutta with 12 divisions; the PTS Pali (Ee) numbers this as one sutta to be expanded as here. It is possible this represents an early form of abridgment. It is also possible, if the sutta began with the full list of what was to be taught (e.g., the Ariyan and unariyan, the bright way  and the dark way, true dhamma and false dhamma ...) that it was, and by implication the other suttas of this sort were, originally single suttas.</p>

						<p>Ten things resulting in one being reborn in Hell, ten resulting in one being reborn in a pleasant or heavenly birth. 'Purgatory' is Woodward's suggested translation for <i>Niraye,</i> Hell, in accordance with a precise understanding of the Judeo-Christian concept where 'Hell' proper is eternal and Purgatory temporary. Since Niraye is a temporary condition, was the thinking, this could not qualify it to be called Hell. The Buddhist position, is that there is no state of existence which is eternal. The common understanding of the idea of Hell today will do for life in Niraye, which can last to the end of a world cycle.</p>

						<p>The Buddha speaks to the issue of the need to understand one's past deeds before one is able to attain Arahantship. He suggests development of the heart of friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment.<br />
						I suggest reading the introduction to my translation of <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/10_tens/an10.208.olds.bd.htm">#208</a> to understand the problems with translation of this sutta, namely that as translated the Buddha is saying that there is no ending kamma without experiencing the consequences of all previously done deeds which is impossible. ... Well, it is possible, twisting one's understanding of what 'experiencing' means. I have explained this elsewhere as being a matter of the degree of effort made to liberate oneself being such as to alter the nature of the consequences so that all consequences get jamed into what remains of one's lifespan and is experienced more mentally than in any other way. But my explanation in #208 uses a different translation of the term being translated 'experiencing' and makes the same case in simpler terms.</p>

						<p>Suttas 207-208. The Buddha speaks to the issue of the need to understand one's past deeds before one is able to attain Arahantship. He suggests development of the heart of friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment. Woodward omits this sutta altogether noting that it is exactly the same as the previous [AN 10.206]. It is most probable that this sutta was originally the beginning of the next sutta [AN 10.208]. Expansion here is as with the previous sutta.</p>

						<p>A mind-bending sutta to make good sense out of. A great exercise in Dhamma Research virtually compelling examination of the Pali and intent contimplation.<br />
						The Buddha speaks to the issue of the need to understand one's past deeds before one is able to attain Arahantship. He suggests development of the heart of friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi's understanding seems to have been based on the commentary. The Buddha says that we must understand our past deeds before we can bring kamma to an end and that we must bring kamma to an end before we can attain Arahantship. Is he speaking of 'experiencing the consequences' or 'understanding the nature'? What is the meaning of his suggestion, made, if taken as given, to appear to be a solution to the idea of experiencing one's kamma prior to rebirth in another realm, to practice the brahmaviharas? The idea is that practicing the brahmaviharas here, they will be beset by; that is they will continually confront; the consequences of one's past deeds and that by comparing the joy of the brahmavihara with the results of kamma one will come to an understanding of the nature of all kamma and the need to abandon deeds. Here you have an ideal opportunity to see the utility of being able to compare several points of view. Judge for yourself!</p>

Woodward's translation missed three sets of the seventeen which have been inserted using the Pali and footnoting to the PED definition and Bhk. Bodhi's translation (A quick search did not turn up Woodward's translation of these terms elsewhere). Bhk. Bodhi's version omits one of the groups included in the PTS version. The BJT has 217 as two suttas. This group has now been unabridged. The sutta subjects were separated out and given individual numbers in both the Woodward translation and the Pali.
