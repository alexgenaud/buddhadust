						<p>The Book of the Gradual Sayings, Vol. II, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/frontmatter/gs.2.introduction_preface.htm">Introduction, by Mrs. Rhys Davids, and Translator's Preface, by F.L. Woodward.</a> Mrs. Rhys Davids Introduction and F.L. Woodward's Preface to The Book of the Gradual Sayings, Volume II: The Book of the Fours. I recommend you stay away from this Introduction until such a point as the tendency to anger, tearing your hair out, pounding your desk and throwing a brick at your computer is well under control. The arrogance and 'superiority' of this woman is beyond comprehension. If she had stuck to her own discipline she would have emerged a hero, but she has felt a need to 'explain Buddhism' to the world and has by that ventured into territory where she is simply an incompetent. She has passionately embraced her own view of what Gotama's teaching <i>'must'</i> have been all about and is defending that view against all comers. What she has done is explained from a theoretical intellectual viewpoint based on her own experience and preconceptions what can only be explained properly by a practitioner. It's like a lawyer, untrained and inexperienced in any aspect of medicine, who writes an introductory text on medicine. For her, everything that does not agree with her view is a later 'monkish' construction (she wants Gotama, who spent most of his time addressing <i>bhikkhus,</i> to have directed his teaching primarily to the less interested common man), and by that she manages to ignore incalculably more than is accommodated by her view.<br />
						I include this work here because it is both the basis of controversy and of historical interest and it has been referenced by Woodward in a sutta in his translation of this volume.</p>

The list includes books known to be much later in origin than the Suttas. This is both discouraging and hopeful. It is discouraging because seeing work of this sort it is clear that there was some tampering with even the suttas. It is discouraging because it has tainted this work with bias (the desire to have works that are not original documentation considered as original documentation) and allowed in doubt. It is hopeful because it shows the childish stupidity of the tamperers. They could not see that it would be easy to see what they have done. What they do is always clumsy and obvious and consequently if one keeps alert they will not lead one astray. (But clearly they have already lead many astray!).</p>

					<h4>II. <i>Cara Vagga,</i> II.11</h4>

						<p class="in1">PTS: Deportment, II.13<br />
						WP: Walking, 399</p>

						<p class="in1"><a id="p11" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.011.pali.bd.htm"><b>#11: <i>Caranta Suttaṃ,</i></b></a> 10</p>

						<p>Whether walking, or standing, or sitting, or lying down, a <i>bhikkhu</i> who does not wish to be known as a slacker, who does not wish to deprive himself of his opportunity for attaining the goal, should rid himself of lustful, deviant, or cruel thoughts.<br />
						Woodward notes that the <i>Pāḷi</i> word used for the title of this sutta, <i>'cara'</i> means 'walking' but he is then forced to say that this includes all the postures. PED: "[from <i>car, carati</i>] 1. the act of going about, walking; one who walks or lives." We say 'carries on'. This is also 'carriage' the manner in which one carries oneself ... whether walking, or standing still, or sitting or lying down ... or acting with mind and speech. The term has wide use and is worth remembering. It has come down even to us in our: 'carriage' (both the vehicle and the way one carries oneself) 'cart' 'car' 'carry'.<br />
						In the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">Satipaṭṭhana Sutta</a> we learn to pay attention to the four postures. Here we see what we should be observing and doing as we make ourselves aware of the postures. I harp on the mistake of thinking this is a practice intended to focus solely on observation of the posture (or sensations, mental states and <i>Dhamma</i>) and noting 'standing, standing, standing' etc. but this is the extent of the practice as taught by huge numbers of followers of <a href="../../../../backmatter/gallery/m_sayadaw.htm">Mahasi Sayadow.</a> We have to acknowledge such persons as pioneers in bringing us <i>Dhamma,</i> but simultaneously we must avoid blindly following what they have taught when the shortcomings of what they have taught become obvious when compared to the greater body of information available later. The goal is not observation of the present moment, it is freedom from identification with the existing. One notes the body, etc., (what is there in front of the eyes) but in context (internal, one's own and what is thought of as one's own, and external, what does not pertain to the self or comes from the outside the 'whole body of available information') relative to sensation, mental state and <i>Dhamma,</i> and all this, even, only to the extent (<i>i.e.,</i> not to be made the point of the practice) that it serves the purpose of calming down to such a degree as enables attaining insight through the lens of the <i>Dhamma</i> into the validity of the Four Truths or the <i>Paṭicca Samuppāda,</i> and further to that insight, to determine what needs to be done to attain the freedom from the existing moment that is the ultimate goal.</p>

						<p>A detailed exposition of the four consummate efforts.<br />
						An important sutta: we do not get what is encompassed by the four consummate efforts described in detail very often.<br />
						Be careful to note <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translation of <i>vossagga</i> as 'release' at the culmination of each of the seven dimensions of self-awakening. Do not confuse with either <i>vimutti</i> or <i>vimokkha.</i> 'Release' really doesn't work here. PED has: "<i>vossagga:</i> relinquishing, relaxation; handing over, donation, gift". So the meaning is 'releasing the world', not 'attaining release.' "letting go" "giving up".</p>

						<p>The Buddha lists the Four major chiefs of beings in the world.<br />
						Woodward translates 'chief types', but these are not the chief types of beings, but the four major chiefs of beings.<br />
						Both Woodward and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi translate the individuals in the list in this sutta as being spoken of in the present tense. This creates a small problem when it comes to Mandhata. In <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.2/jat.2.258.rous.pts.htm">the <i>Jātaka</i> story,</a> Mandhata is identified with The Buddha. So from these two sources of information, as translated, we are told: Gotama is his own early ancestor. (Not a problem given the nature of rebirth.) Gotama was two of the preeminent beings he is describing. (Somewhat of a problem as they are incompatible, for this would be telling us that The Buddha (as <i>Tathāgata</i>) is one who possesses or enjoys sense-pleasures when it is clearly stated in numerous places that one does not speak of the <i>'Tathāgata'</i> in this way.)  But if Gotama is not to be identified with Mandhata, how can Mandhata be being spoken of in the present tense as the mythical Mandhata is long dead?<br />
						Trying to resolve this problem if we conclude that the <i>Jātaka</i> story, as a story of a previous life of the Buddha is a later invention, but that the story of Mandhata was likely one well known to at least the Sakyans, we are left thinking that the mention of Mandhata in the present tense in this sutta is hardly a useful example of what it means to be supreme in the enjoyment or possession of sense-pleasures as we know 1. that he is dead, and 2. we know nothing about his current location or experiences. Either we have here a case where the teaching of the Buddha is not well done, or that this is not a true sutta given by the Buddha, or we have to conclude that the <i>Jātaka</i> story is a true story of one of the Buddha's former lives and that the point of using Mandhata as an example was to create this question in our minds and force us to see that Gotama and Mandhata were one and the same individuality and that this is a way for the Buddha to tell the <i>bhikkhus</i> that a <i>Tathāgata</i> enjoys sense-pleasures. (Just a little too twisted even in my view of Gotama's subtlety, and still amounting to a view rejected by the Buddha.) I suggest a different construction:<br />
						<i>etad aggaṃ bhikkhave kāmabhogīnaṃ yad idaṃ rājā Mandhātā;</i><br />
						At the top, beggars, that is to say of sense-pleasure possessors/enjoyers: King Mandhata.<br />
						'At the top' meaning 'at the all-time top'.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes four ways to not get there. In this and the next three suttas Woodward translates <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/gati-agati.htm"><i>'gati'</i></a> as 'bourn' which has the effect in these cases, where the term is <i>'a-gati'</i> of turning these suttas upside down. One way of describing the aim of the system is to say that it is to achieve the state where there are no further 'bourns' and one sure way not to achieve that goal is to take hold of desires, hatred, stupidity and give reign to fear. But by Woodwards phrasing this is just what one is to do. Of course the meaning is that these are the four ways of going wrong or getting things or behaving incorrectly or the acting against 'good form' that is mentioned in the <i>gāthās.</i><br />
						If the <i>gāthās</i> were eliminated, the possible meanings for each sutta are dual and opposite depending on whether one understands the intent to be pointing to the goal of the arahant or a worldly goal and whether one is to understand the subject as 'ways of going wrong' or 'what you get from going wrong' <b>i.e.,</b> destinies. Aside from the <i>gāthās</i> there is no reason to think that these double meanings were not deliberate, if not, perhaps, hidden to most under the meaning as we hear it now. This sutta paints half of a picture. The other half is in the next sutta, and the sutta following that combines the two. I have translated that sutta just to put in my thought about how it should be read. Otherwise <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's translation would do. The fourth in the series gives a variation which looks to my eye as though it was intended to point to what is to be understood in the lot as it gives an every-day example.

						<p>Eight sorts of persons. Those governed by wrath, hypocrisy, gains, and fame, and those governed by <i>Dhamma.</i> These lists of persons found throughout the suttas are very helpful when it comes to controlling one's reactions to what feels like unreasonable behavior. Not everyone is governed by the reasonableness of the <i>Dhamma.</i> It is not likely, for example, that one will find success in dealing with a person governed by wrath by responding directly to any given episode of wrath. One must approach strategically, understanding the basis from which the person operates, and making one's response appear rational from that perspective.</p>

						This sutta looks like it should just be the second half of the previous sutta. It might be interesting to some to note that in the <i>Pāḷi</i> there is an unusual effort made to make this repetition of the sutta read like a modern narrative. Where usually what we find in such cases is an exact repetition of the events as they were previously told, here there is inserted such transitional phrases as: "When he had said that, I responded ..." So now we have three ways repetitions are found: strict repetition, encapsulation ('and they repeated all that had happened') and this narrative form. I suggest none of them existed in the original event; that originally exact repetition was the expected form.</p>

The names for mother and father given here are of deep psychological importance. For the infant, the parents are indeed the Creator, the first teachers, the first gods and for the service they do for their child when it is young and helpless they are indeed worthy of offerings. Even the most neglectful parents have given their child life, food, clothing and much else. Most parents will have done more for their child than anyone else in the world will ever do. Those ideas which were not well articulated in infancy do not abandon the individual but underlie and support his entire relationship with the world throughout his life and returning again in old age they ask for their due and for the one who has neglected his parents this is a heavy debt to pay.

						<p class="f4">This is a phenomena that is the inverse of mind-reading: Thought projection. Ideas are things. They float around out there available to everyone and only become 'one's own' with identification. If a thought is strongly generated by one person (being) it can be identified with by others. Think of the universe as a gigantic brain in which signals are ever-present and where beings are like signal-receiving, but also signal-boosting stations.<br />
						I recommend reading this sutta in the <i>Pāḷi</i> even if you do not understand the <i>Pāḷi</i> ... though having the translation right there it is a simple matter to see what is what. The actual charm is the centered verses below the short introductory story. I also believe this 'charm' will be much more effective if said with comprehension in the <i>Pāḷi</i> if only because it is really 'charming' to the ear. Relax and you can see how a snake would find it so.<br />

						<p>The Buddha likens the fate of Devadatta to several things that bear fruit to their own destruction.<br />
						There seems to me to be a problem here with Woodward's translation of <i>'parābhavāya'.</i> The plantain, bamboo, reed and mule are said to <i>'atta-vadhāya'</i> 'destruction of self' and <i>'parābhavāya'</i> which Woodward translates 'destruction of others'. That Devadatta brought about problems for others is obvious, but not so obvious is the harm done to others by these other things. PED just has 'destruction.' 'Others' is not found in the word or outside it. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has 'to his own ruin and destruction' which looks to be the better translation. Maybe 'to his own ruin and general <i>(para)</i> destruction. The problem here is holding on to <i>'atta'</i> as 'self'. (little joke).</p>

						<p>The Buddha defines the four best ways of making effort. Here is a good opportunity to see the way Gotama has constructed his system so as to make it 'helpful in the beginning, helpful in the middle and helpful at the end'. What he has done is worded the formula so as to make it generic. Taken as it is, in the beginning, the idea of what is an 'unprofitable state' and what is a 'profitable state' is left undeclared so that it applies to each individual as he himself defines it. That in turn will be a value which is under a constant state of upward revision because no matter how low the individual begins, by pointing himself to what he believes at that point is a profitable state, he moves himself forward to some degree. That is true even in the case of very low ideas of 'profit' such as increase in pleasure or wealth. In no long time success in the pursuit of a low level profit will be seen as the pursuit of the unprofitable. It is a natural course of things, for example, that the sensualist will discover that sensual pleasure is enhanced by abstinence. And if initially only to increase his pleasure he will turn to letting go and the track from there is steadily in the upward direction. It is also the natural course of things that the acquisition of wealth leads to the perception that there are higher degrees and forms of wealth. Because making the effort will result in the gain of profit or the elimination of the unprofitable, etc. there will be instilled faith in the formula and further effort, and so on. Just by beginning a benevolent cycle is set rolling. At a later point one will discover that what is considered 'profitable' in this system is the further set of generic instructions found in the Eightfold Path and later still in the Seeker's Path. Always the particulars will be left to the perception of the individual even when these latter are given in detail: the details are themselves generic in form.</p>

						<p>A wonderful sutta though of a sort likely to be discredited by many of 'modern' thought. The Buddha outlines the effects of leaders of men both good and bad. It has been pointed out here a few times that what needs to be seen is that this world is a work of the collective imagination and the laws of physics that govern it are, so far from being immutable, highly subject to agreement as to what is and what is not possible. However much there is currently disagreement that there is such a thing as the influence on natural events of the behavior of men, what we have today is a corrupt leadership leading a corrupt populace into further corruption while at the same time there is drastic weather alteration, alteration of the position of the earth's pole and the manner in which that alters perception of the courses of the moon and sun, stress on food production and a deterioration of over-all health in the populous. Some will argue with that last, but I would say that what we have, in so far as there is an increase in longevity, is the prolongation of the lives of a much weaker people through mechanical means. Left to nature, the lifespan of people would be decreasing. People are for the most part trading quality of life for length of life.</p>

The important phrase to understand in this sutta is <i>'na cintetabbāni.'</i> Woodward's 'unthinkable', <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: 'unconjecturables'; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'inconceivable.

						<p>The four states of purity of gifts.

Think of the difference between the result of a wet rag thrown by a weak man against a hanging blanket versus a rubber ball thrown by a strong man against a smooth hard wall. 'Purity' is fundamentally a matter of detachment. 'Virtue' is the not-doing of unvirtuous deeds.

						<p>Four reasons women do not occupy stations of importance, engage in commerce or trade. Both Woodward's and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translations have problems which will put women's backs up. I have done my translation hoping to show an alternative way the sutta can be read. The common problem is the categorical statement "Women are ... x,y,z bad trait. Which is why they do not do x,y,z, manly things." The <i>Pāḷi</i> must be 'heard' without the implication that these are absolute states. The construction is: "Wrath Ananda womenfolk" etc. To translate: "Women are wrathful" must be heard as 'women being ~' or 'if a woman be', or 'are for the most part', 'are generally', 'some women are' etc. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has attempted to mitigate the issue by inserting the words 'are prone,' but 'prone' is not in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and his translation still comes across as an irrational statement on the part of the Buddha. Separately, Woodward has changed the statement 'go to Kamboja' to 'reach the essence of the deed' reading <i>'kamm'ojaṃ'</i> for <i>'Kambojam'.</i> The original PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> (since changed), the BJT and the CSCD, the commentary and whatever <i>Pāḷi</i> is being used by <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi all have <i>'Kamboja.'</i> Woodward has footnoted the commentary statement that this is to be understood as an idiom standing for 'foreign trade,' but he cannot see the sense of that. But there are too many examples in the suttas of women who have become Arahant to think that the meaning could be that women do not penetrate through to the essence of the deed. The bias of his translation has blinded Woodward to this contradiction in his understanding. As it stands to defend these translations would be to say that Gotama did not foresee the state of women in future time, or even outside the local area at that time and, additionally, or, to put it another way, this would be to say that this sutta was not 'timeless'. I believe my translation overcomes these drawbacks.</p>

						<p>If the four previous suttas were intended to be taken together as a puzzle, there seem to be errors in Blue-Lotus 1 and White-Lotus 1. Both should have been that 'he weakened the <i>āsavas</i>', not destroyed them. The releases are attainable by even the Streamwinner but still there is a distinction there that would make the relationship rational. Then all four groups would have the structure: Streamwinner, Once Returner, Non-returner, Arahant. Blue Lotus 3 could be experiencing temporary release. Otherwise perhaps Woodward's speculation that the first group only was original and the others made up (carelessly) to form the usual group of four pairs of men (those on the four paths). Or there is also the (doubtful) possibility that there was no intention of making the four sets parallel each other.<br />
						Then there is the problem with the translation of <i>'appattamānaso' (appatta-mānaso)</i> in the situation in Immovable Shaman 4. Woodward translates:  'has not made up his mind', <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'has not attained his mind's ideal'. Both of these appear to me at least as highly shakable. I suggest taking the word back a step: <i>appa pa atta māmaso</i> 'a little past mastering his mind'. Or 'mastering the mind' could be understood as a higher state than the certainty of attaining the goal of the Streamwinner. To be 'unshakable' he must have got at least this far.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi argues from an assumption that Blue-Lotus 1 and White-Lotus 1 are correct that there appears to be a weakening of the standards for Arahantship involved. It could be that or it could be an error in the understanding of the situation on the part of the commentator or as I suggest, an error in the recollection of the sutta.</p>

						<p>An expansion of the previous sutta. The Buddha describes four sorts of persons classified according to their attainment of calm of heart and the higher wisdom of insight into things and then urges the <i>bhikkhus</i> to make effort to establish their accomplishments and eliminate their deficiencies and further to press on to the elimination of the corrupting influences. Note that neither is calm the goal nor is insight the goal nor are the two together the goal, but that with the two together the corrupting influences may be eliminated and the goal attained. Calm of heart is not exclusively the <i>jhānas.</i> Consummate <i>'samādhi'</i> is the <i>jhānas,</i> but along the way a serene calm should be the goal throughout the day in every activity. If one's practice is to create insight over here and practice creating serenity over there between the hours of x and y, or while a candle burns down one inch, or during the time a stick of incense burns down, or the effects of a joint wear off, by the sole technique of <i>jhāna,</i> it is likely that the whole practice will suffer. Whether walking or standing still or sitting or lying down, still, calm, tranquillize the entire experience of embodied living.</p>

						<p>Gotama convinces Potaliya that of four sorts of persons the one who speaks timely, truthful praise of the praiseworthy and timely, truthful dispraise of what deserves dispraise is the most excellent of the four. I have edited this sutta somewhat to eliminate ambiguities in several places in Woodward's translation. The final result follows the <i>Pāḷi</i> and comes closer to <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translation which is clear. The very interesting thing in this sutta (once it is unabridged and straightened up) is the visibility here of the way in which at least one style of dialog was conducted (there are many examples of this style in the suttas). Gotama lays out four cases and asks Potaliya to say which he thinks is best. Potaliya chooses one which is not the one which Gotama thinks is best. Gotama states that of the choices, a certain one is best. (No "you are wrong, I am right", but no waffling either. He makes the statement "This is the best, and for such and such a reason." In response Pataliya does not say "you are right, I am wrong," but indicates his acceptance of Gotama's case by stating it as Gotama has stated it explaining it as Gotama has explained it. This is the combat of two ideas without bringing in the personalities. Potalia might have disagreed up to three times and Gotama repeated the case up to a third time before Potaliya's head split into seven pieces.</p>

						<p>In this sutta Gotama compares four sorts of persons to the conditions of four water pots: one that is covered and empty, one that is uncovered and full; one that is both uncovered and empty; and one that is covered and full. He defines 'covered' as charming comportment, 'full' as knowledge of the Four Truths.</p>

						<p>The <i>Pāḷi</i> has:<br />
						<i>Tuccho pihito,||<br />
						pūro vivaṭo,||<br />
						tuccho vivaṭo,||<br />
						pūro pihito.|| ||</i></p>

						<p>Empty and covered<br />
						full and uncovered<br />
						empty and uncovered<br />
						full and covered,<br />
						which is followed by Woodward and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi:</p>

						<p>In the first case the person is charming but has no knowledge,<br />
						in the second case he is not charming but has knowledge,<br />
						in the third case he has neither charm nor knowledge<br />
						and in the fourth case he has both charm and knowledge.</p>

						<p>The two good qualities are (according to the order of the details as we find them in the <i>Pāḷi</i>): 'full' of water which stands for charming comportment; and 'covered' which stands for comprehension of the Four Truths.</p>

						<p>In the case of water-pots, 'empty' and 'uncovered' are not good things.<br />
						So following the details as they are presented, the order should have been:</p>

						<p><i>Pūro vivaṭo,||<br />
						tuccho pihito,||<br />
						tuccho vivaṭo,||<br />
						puro pihito,</i>|| ||</p>

						<p>Full and uncovered,<br />
						empty and covered,<br />
						empty and uncovered, and<br />
						full and covered.</p>

						<p>If we take it that the headings as they are found are correct and the details have been reversed, we would have comportment standing for 'covered' and knowledge standing for 'full'. This would more closely parallel the thinking in the previous two suttas where 'thunder' stands for speech in the one case and superficial book knowledge in the second, and rain (which, do I need to point out? is water) stands for understanding. This would also better satisfy the mind as indicating that 'full' points to the more significant aspect and 'covered' to the more superficial aspect.</p>

						<p>But there is a further complication: The pattern in the previous suttas is that the first person's first quality is a positive one. The second person has the deeper quality but lacks the quality of lesser importance. And considering that, we cannot put understanding of the Four Truths in the place of the second place.</p>

						<p>One way or the other the <i>Pāḷi</i> is incorrect and Woodward and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi follow and to make the sutta make sense either the headings need to change or the order of the details needs to change.</p>

						<p>What to do?</p>

						<p>I have chosen to change the order in the headings from first full, second covered, to first covered and second full (using Woodwards terms 'closed' and 'open', 'full' and 'empty'.)</p>

						<p><i>Pihito tuccho,||<br />
						vivaṭo pūro,||<br />
						vivaṭo tuccho,||<br />
						pihito pūro.</i>|| ||</p>

						<p>Covered and empty<br />
						uncovered and full<br />
						uncovered and empty<br />
						covered and full,</p>

						<p>This allows the details to remain in their current order and puts The Four Truths in the position given most respect.</p>

						<p>Long explanation for a simple change, but in this case the <i>Pāḷi</i> and all the translations agree but all are in error and in such a case I need to present all the reasoning in back of a change. I have not changed the <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

Both problems seem to arise from the summary index at the end of the chapter <i>(uddāna)</i> and are likely the result of an attempt to make the chapter have the usual ten suttas.

						<p>The Buddha likens persons to snakes in the matter of their possession of venom and the potency of that venom. This one appears to rely on word-play similar to our double meaning for venom: poison and poisonous temperament. But the word for poisonous temperament means 'terribly-poisonous', which leaves us with the best case being 'not terribly poisonous' which is still poisonous. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi probably has the best solution to this one: 'one who's venom is quick to come up but not virulent', etc. where the best case becomes 'neither quick to come up nor virulent.' But we still end up with a sutta that deals with sorts of people with anger.</p>

						<p>A Wondrous light appears when a Buddha descends into his mother's womb, at his birth, at his awakening and upon his first setting to roll the wheel of <i>Dhamma.</i> This may well be a literal light, but it is also a fit simile for the effects of the <i>Dhamma.</i> At other points he is said to have spoken metaphorically of his appearance as being a light brought into the world, which it certainly was, and that was certainly marvel enough. Also, this light that he brought is said to make it possible for beings living in darkness to see that there are other beings there. This is a remark very frequently made by those who have become converts. I suggest this is a reference to the breaking of <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's problem</a> which unbroken makes it impossible to prove to one's self that there are other beings there.

						<p>The Buddha points out the marvelous way nobles, Brahmins, householders and ascetics take delight when a Wheel-turning King approaches and speaks and then he compares this phenomena with the similar thing that happens when Ananda approaches and teaches <i>bhikkhus, bhikkhunis,</i> laymen and lay-women. With this sutta one can see the nature of seeing into the future. At another point Gotama says of Ananda that if he did not attain to Arahantship, he would become a Wheel-turning King. Although for most of us the memory of the last wheel-turning King will be somewhat faint, the mechanism is the same for seeing into the future by way of comparison with past events that are more easily called to mind. This is not the same thing as predicting the future from past events as it is practiced by the weatherman or the general or the political scientist. That is an intellectual exercise which is frequently incorrect. This is 'seeing' in a moment of intuition, the correspondence of two events and 'knowing' the significance. So after three suttas giving us marvels, we have a fourth telling us how to see such things for ourselves. That is, if you have an open mind and a ready ear. Otherwise you are, of course, free to think 'he is just talking through his hat.'</p>

						<p>Four paths to the eradication of the corrupting influences: the unpleasant slow path to higher knowledge; the unpleasant fast path to higher knowledge, the pleasant slow path to higher knowledge, and the pleasant swift path to higher knowledge.<br />
						A variation on the previous, with this sutta providing the methods of practice used by those following each path. Of note here is something that could be used to support the idea of arahantship without the <i>jhānas.</i> The first two modes of practice do not use the <i>jhānas</i> as their <i>samādhi</i> practice; they use meditation on the foul. (If we stretch our minds all the way over to <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.009.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.54.9</a> we can see that it appears that meditation on the foul was at an early point the <i>main</i> practice employed by the <i>bhikkhus</i> to establish serenity <i>(samādhi)</i>.) The distinction is clear. The difference is that by using the <i>jhānas</i> the practice is pleasant. All four paths depend on the practitioners powers <i>(balāni)</i> of faith, modesty, self-restraint, energy, and wisdom. Speed of insight depends on the degree to which the forces <i>(indriya)</i> of faith, energy, mind, serenity and wisdom are found in him. These latter are characterized (in the previous sutta) as 'givens' depending on the individual's basic nature in terms of the degree to which he is passionate, malicious, infatuated. ('Given' does not mean unalterable. It's just what you start with.)<br />
						So the method described here is that one who works at reducing his passionate, malicious, infatuated nature, controlling himself by way of faith, modesty, self-restraint, energy, and wisdom, would experience a proportionate rise in the forces of faith, energy, mind, serenity and wisdom and by that an increase in the speed of his attainment of higher knowledge. If he is indifferent as to whether or not his path is pleasant, he uses the meditation on the foul, if he wishes his path to be pleasant he uses the <i>jhānas.</i> Who would choose the unpleasant path? Maybe it is that <i>jhāna</i> practice requires great long stretches of solitude, calm, peace, quiet to develop. Such things are not always easy to come by. Meditation on the foul is a practice which can be worked into a more turbulent life situation.</p>

None of these quite works. The word also means 'earth' which in the simile does not react when filth is thrown at it, etc. Good/ill humored? Forgiving/unforgiving? Indulgent/unindulgent?</p>

						<p>The Buddha distinguishes between two sorts of persons in accordance with their path: one pair meditates on the foul and one pair uses the <i>jhānas.</i> Of each pair one attains extinguishment here and one hereafter. In the case of the first pair, meditating on the foul, extinguishment either here or hereafter comes with own-making <i>(saṅkhāra).</i> In the case of the second pair, using the <i>jhānas,</i> extinguishment either here or hereafter comes without own-making.<br />
						In the description of the type of person Woodward translates <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> as 'with- and without effort'; but in the list of contemplations, he translates it 'activities'. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi does a similar thing using 'exertion' and 'conditioned phenomena'. <i>'Saṅkhāra'</i> does have the dual meaning of the activity used to create personal existence and the identified-with existing thing, but the translation should make it more obvious that it is the two sides of this one idea that are being spoken of. 'Confounding' and 'the confounded' or 'fabricating' and 'the fabricated'. And <b>it is not 'conditioned'!</b> (etymology cannot be just ignored! And this is just blindly following previous wrong translations.) (see the discussion: <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna Conditioned</a>) And the idea is not just 'activity' but 'identification with the intent to create the experience of pleasure through action of thought, speech, and body; and the identified with result. It is essential to grasp this idea in order to understand how the Buddha is distinguishing the two sets of individuals. The contemplation of the unpleasant involves <i>saṅkhāra</i> (it involves personal, identified-with perceptions and thoughts and intentions and behavior), where the <i>jhānas</i> do not (or, at least they evolve towards and culminate in detachment precluding own-making). In other words both paths get one there, but the one using contemplation of the foul involves a battle with issues of the self which must be resolved first. This is a very important sutta to read when trying to understand the meaning of <i>saṅkhāra.</i> If you do not have the concept correctly, the sutta makes no sense.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes how it is intent that is the mechanism of action of <i>kamma</i> of body, speech and mind that results in the personal experience of pleasure or pain in body, speech, or mind. Intent, in turn, is shown to be impersonal. The intent driving a deed can arise in the self or in another. Further, the groundwork for action can be known or unknown. In whatever combination of factors it is blindness that is at the bottom of it and the elimination of blindness that ends <i>kamma.</i><br />
						An example of other-instigated (or motivated) intent and preparation for action would be the case of the soldier being commanded to act by the general, the employee by the boss, etc. In the case of an other-instigated intent, both the instigator and the one who is instigated experience the consequences in accordance with the intent. There is no escape by saying 'I was just following orders.' Better to refuse to act when the action (<i>e.g.,</i> killing, lying, theft, etc., for whatever reason) deviates from one's own perspective on the <i>kammic</i> outcome and take the consequences than to follow orders and take consequences resulting from another's intent (<i>e.g.,</i> to inflict pain from motives based in lust, hate, delusion)! At least you won't end up in Hell from refusing to do some foul deed.<br />
						This sutta is, in some versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> and in <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translation, combined with the next sutta. Whether or not it was at one time a single sutta, it should be read in conjunction with that sutta.</p>

						<p>A well-known (and too little used) sutta. The Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> to determine whether or not a saying is to be considered as his word by comparing the phrases and their construction (<i>pada-vyañjana: pada:</i> phrase; <i>vyañjana,</i> lubrication, component parts; Woodward: 'words and syllables'; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'words and phrases'. The precise meanings of this phrase is worth a deeper look. <i>'Pada'</i> is literally 'foot', <i>pāda</i> 'footstep' or 'path'. In the spoken language the 'letter' was a syllable, and the <i>bhikkhus</i> were on occasion remarked to take pride in repeating Gotama's word 'down to the syllable', but <i>vyañjana</i> means 'letter' only in the sense of 'as opposed to the spirit'. It does mean component part and derives from the idea of lubricant (enabling the letters to work together and make sense) and stretching out, drawing out or erecting, <i>i.e.</i> the construction of the phrase) with the phrases and their construction as found in the Suttas and in the <i>Vinaya.</i> This is to be done even in the case of four great authorities: Someone who has reportedly heard a saying face-to-face with the Buddha; some <i>Saṅgha</i> with a reportedly learned elder; some reportedly learned <i>Saṅgha;</i> a single reportedly learned monk.<br />
						Today this is taught with the idea that we are to accept it as the word of the Buddha if it comes from any of these four 'authorities'. This is exactly the opposite of the meaning found in the sutta. We should also add that this work of comparison should be done with any reportedly true saying heard from any 'authority' or read about (including any translation from the <i>Pāḷi</i>) in any book or anywhere on the internet.

						<p>Upaka, tries to trap Gotama and ends up caught in the trap himself. Gotama then explains that what he teaches is simply what is profitable and what is not.<br />
						He tries to get Gotama to agree to the statement that having uttered abusive speech that one cannot back up, one is blameworthy. He is thinking that Gotama's having stated that Devadata was going to Hell was abuse whereas it was simply a statement of fact. But Gotama does not fall into the trap and in stead points out that by approaching him with the intent to trap him Upaka has himself uttered abusive speech which he cannot back up. There is a further twist in the story when Upaka tries to tell the story to King Ajatasattu, a former supporter of Devadata's, but who had recently been converted by Gotama. The King is not pleased to be associated with someone who thinks he can get the better of Gotama.</p>

						<p>A Brahmin questions Gotama about Sonakayana's misunderstanding of the meaning of Gotama's teaching about <i>kamma</i> that ends <i>kamma.</i> Gotama repeats what he has actually said about dark and light deeds and deeds that are neither dark nor light that result in the ending of <i>kamma.</i><br />
						An important sutta for underscoring the idea that the Buddha is not teaching by this doctrine ineffectiveness of <i>kamma.</i> Many in a certain <i>dhamma</i> study group on the internet would benefit greatly in seeing this sutta and understanding its point. Many others would benefit greatly in understanding how easily very dangerous ideas can arise from not paying careful attention to what Gotama is actually teaching. The view that <i>kamma</i> is ineffectual was taught by a contemporary of Gotama named <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/makkhali_gosala.htm">Mikkhali,</a> and was called the most pernicious of man-traps. (PS: anyone who recognizes this group and would bring benefit to its members by showing them this sutta should do so with heightened wariness, careful crafting of his words, conscious compassion, complete suppression of any tendency to anger, and preparedness for a swift but dignified termination of the discussion when attacked. One can but give them the information, they must arrive at understanding on their own. They are heavily invested in their point of view.)</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes <i>kamma</i> in terms of dark and light deeds, using the Seven Dimensions of Awakening for the <i>kamma</i> that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither dark nor bright, <i>kamma</i> that ends <i>kamma.</i><br />
						Note that this sutta (and similarly for the previous sutta the Eight Dimensional Way) is saying that the Seven Dimensions of Awakening is constructed of <i>intentional not-doings.</i> That includes <i>'Sati'</i> (mind, minding, recollection, memory, attention) and <i>'Samādhi'</i> (serenity). It is not too difficult to see that <i>'Samādhi'</i> is constructed of a series of abandonings, each higher state being attained not by 'getting' but by 'letting go of the previous state,' but how do we understand <i>'sati'</i> to be intentional not-doing? <i>sati</i> in this case is recollection of body, sensation, mental-states and things seen through the lens of <i>Dhamma</i> with the idea of observing how they come to be, are maintained, and come to an end with the further idea of becoming thoroughly objectively detached from them. The intentional not-doing is the not becoming attached or identified with such things as they come into awareness (or are recollected). Woodward and Mrs. Rhys Davids have both remarked how it must be a distortion of the system originally taught by Gotama that all virtues are negative ones (<i>i.e.,</i> 'abstaining from'). This is the fact and it is an essential orientation required by anyone who would understand this system. The entire point of this series of suttas is that there is <i>kamma</i> which perpetuates <i>kamma</i> and living in the world and there is a sort of <i>kamma</i> which is the key to escaping <i>kamma</i> and that is intentionally not doing the sort of <i>kamma</i> that perpetuates <i>kamma</i> and living in the world. The Buddha's Methods always result in a good outcome, and on occasion and when asked Gotama does directly teach <i>kamma</i> that has positive worldly results (attaining beauty, wealth, health, long life, heavenly rebirth), but when the result is worldly gain, this is to be seen as a sort of failure in terms of the goal of his system ... a falling short of that which is higher and better.</p>

						<p>The Buddha extols the benefits of fear of punishment using a comparison between the fear of worldly persons of the punishments of evil-doers in the world with the awareness of <i>bhikkhus</i> and <i>bhikkhunis</i> of the punishments of recalcitrant members of the Order.<br />
						An interesting view is given in this sutta of the behavior of at least a portion of the society with regard to guilty deeds. That is that the guilty volunteer themselves for punishment. There was a similar practice in ancient China. There was apparently no expectation of leniency because of volunteering in this way, nor was leniency given. The issue was considered to be that by this behavior the honor of the individual was redeemed. Consider the state of affairs here today (USA Wednesday, June 04, 2014 5:48 AM) where the accused are always advised to plead "not guilty" and to fight to evade punishment to the end. After all, why should the common criminal behave differently than the king and the ministers of state? After all, why plead guilty to having broken unjust and irrational laws? Perhaps following the example of the Japanese politician and high-ranking business executive, in the past few years there has been a tendency for persons of note to publicly apologize for misbehavior after being caught. That's not quite the same thing, and the motive is always seen to be self-serving rather than honor-redeeming.</p>

						<p>Four things which conduce to the growth of wisdom and which are beneficial for one who has become human. This sutta is divided into two suttas in some versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> and understood to be two suttas by <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi. On the surface making them into two suttas seems logical as, although the content of both halfs is identical, the point is directed at two different sorts of persons. There is another way to read this which is that the four helpful things can be understood at two different levels. One applied to the <i>bhikkhus,</i> and one applied to all 'beings who have become human' (where the possibility exists that there is no fully awakened one to follow and no <i>Dhamma,</i> capital 'D'.) In this latter case combining the two would serve to emphasize the double meanings.</p>
