						<p>Three elders differ on the best of three forms of Stream-entry and submit the question to the Buddha.<br />
						This sutta deals with three sorts of attainments: <i>Kāya-sakkhī,</i> the 'body-eyes' one who has seen the true nature of body with his own eyes, so at least provisionally: 'body-knower'; <i>Diṭṭha-ppatto,</i> the 'view-secured' (bowled, in-the-bowl, bagged); and <i>Saddhā-vimutto,</i> the 'faith-freed'. The Buddha makes it clear that these are modes or types of practice that have lead to stream-entry, they are not levels in a heierarchy. Any one of the three may be working for arahantship, or non-returning or once-returning. The body witness is one who has made <i>jhāna</i> practice his main focus. The view-attainer has made perception of the truth of the teachings the main focus of his practice. The faith-freed has made faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saŋgha the main focus of his practice.</p>

						<p>Providing medical treatment to three types of persons is likened to teaching Dhamma to three types of persons. One sort of person will not recover whether he receives treatment or not; one will recover whether he receives treatment or not; and one will recover if he receives treatment, but not if he does not. Similarly one sort of person will not gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; one will gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; and one will gain the path if he hears Dhamma and not if he does not. It is for the sake of the sick man who will recover if he receives medical treatment that providing medical treatment for the sick is not useless. Similarly it is for the sake of the one who will gain the path if he hears Dhamma that teaching Dhamma is not useless.</p>

						<p>By identification with intentional deviant, non-deviant or mixed deeds one creates personal experience of deviant, non-deviant or mixed worlds.<br />
						"Volitional Activities' is Bhk. Bodhi's translation of <i>Saŋkhāra.</i> The reader should keep in mind that this word is very much like and almost a synonym of 'kamma' and needs to accommodate both the act of creation and the thing that results. The differentiation between this term and kamma is essentially the emphasis put on the personal nature of the creating and the results. To 'sankhara' one identifies with the intent to create personal experience by way of thought, word or deed. The result is personal experience formed by the nature of the intent when creating. (This sutta describes the process.) The word, properly translated must convey this dual nature and this personalizing process. I have suggested 'own-making' <i>Saŋ = own; + khāra = make.</i> and 'the own-made'. What it is not is just 'activities' or 'mental formations' or 'fabrications' or anything else without the sense of those activities etc being the means of constructing one's own personal world. But 'activities' although sankharing is activity, does not relate etymologically with the word at all, and 'mental ... and volitionl' are also 'explanations' unrelated to the word. Sticking closely to the Pali we could get: 'con-struction', 'con-fection,' 'con-juration,' 'co-formation,' etc. But where we have elsewhere the terms 'I-making' and 'My-making' why not also 'Own-making?' What it absolutely is not is 'conditioning'...which translation leads into major misunderstanding of Dhamma. [see: <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbana Conditioned?</a>] For the various terms used by other translators visit the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankhara.htm">Glossology</a> page.</p>

						<p>The three points at which kamma originates and the three where kamma is ended.<br />
						The word here to understand is <i>'nidāna'.</i> Nidana = Down-bound. The 'nidana' is the first knot beginning the weaving process (kamma — pun certainly intended). Too often inappropriately translated 'cause' (as here in all translations but my own). In casual English, 'cause' is understood less as the force of creation than as simply something that happens co-insidentally: 'just because'; in precise English, 'cause' is always an imprecise concept. To make a cup of tea what is required is a cup, water, tea-leaves, a heat source, the effort of an individual and a thousand other things that are necessary for these things to exist. Which of these is the 'cause' of a cup of tea? Or a disease? Or Pain? At best one should always use 'proximate cause' or 'economic cause' but better would be to forget this idea altogether and train your thinking to understanding the idea of 'dependence'. Nidana means more like 'tied up in/to' involved with, but also 'beginning' which is the basis for the other often used translation 'foundation', 'basis.' It is also the first 'condition' necessary to begin weaving. Here what is indicated by the context is a way to say 'There are three "factors based on which" "tied to which" "dependent upon which" action begins.' "Tied-up with," "bound-up in" "Tied down to".</p>

This is not to say that the results are not long lasting, or that some of the promised benefits of following the system do not take working at or arrive later in Time, but the sage will see in the mechanism of action that there is benefit in the beginning, benefit in the middle and benefit at the end and that even the benefit at the beginning is worth the effort.</p>

						<p>A wealthy brahmin has heard the story told by the ancients of a time when this world was densely populated and villages and towns and cities grew up right next to each other. He asks Gotama why it is that this is no longer the case and is told that it is because at this time the people are obsessed with lusts, depravities and wrong views resulting in a number of calamaties that depopulate the earth.<br />
						A tough sutta for modern man to digest for several reasons. Nobody I think will argue that the people today are not as depraved as described, and that that results in wars, but that this depravity affects the weather and crops and causes the unleashing of demonic beings will be harder to see. And then there is the issue of feeding such a dense population ... and this was speaking of a time when the lifespan of man was in the tens of thousands of years.<br />
						How can this be seen? This world is a work of the imagination, individual and collective. The individual has no way to know the nature of 'the real world', what he can know is simply the three experiences through the senses, what he 'sees' and 'hears' and 'tastes' and 'touches' has no more concrete reality to it than a dream, but because man desires to live collectively he agrees to believe the world is of a certain nature, possesses certain properties beyond solidity, liquidity, heat and light, motion, space and consciousness. Thus the apparent world is one which is arrived at by consensus*. That consensus changes over time. That's how.<br />
						*Actually examined closely it will be seen that outside the sangha there are hardly two people in the world that agree with each other about almost anything. What it is is a 'consensis reality' arrived at by the hoodwinking of weak, ignorant majorites by powerful ignorant minorities.</p>

						<p>The Buddha lays out three positions concerning what is going on here which lead to making no effort to extract oneself from a bondage which entails pain and the endless continuation of pain in rebirth. He then explains his doctrine which does inspire activity towards ending pain and rebirth.<br />
						This is an extremely interesting sutta for anyone attempting to break into the just-above-the-beginner level of understanding this Dhamma. In several places throughout the suttas it is hinted that 'seeing the Four Truths, one sees the Paticca Samuppada; Seeing the Samuppada one sees the Four Truths'. Here in this sutta the two are combined in one. I think this only happens in one other sutta. It is very important for understanding the fact that each of the major segments of the Dhamma are in fact just ways of re-stating the Four Truths in other terms. Understanding this will go a long way to eliminate conflicts between various practices that emphasize one or another of the multiplicity of methods put forward in the Suttas and will greatly simplify comprehension of the system as a whole.</p>

						<p>Gotama speaks of three terrors of the common people and shows how their fears go too far; he follows that by speaking of three terrors not subject to remediation through wishes; and then he points the way to overcome terrors.<br />
						This sutta speaks to a deep psychological terror, not simply to the fears caused by natural calamity, but the fears that arise facing death of the self or a loved one; twin drives which underlie the search for rebirth driven by the great bond between mothers and sons.<br />
						There are a couple of very difficult terms to understand in this sutta and Woodward, Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi and myself have as a result each got the intent of it and the construction of the logic differently. To my mind the greatest danger comes from Woodward's understanding of the conclusion which points to the idea as being a way for mother's and sons to be united. This is not the idea of the sutta. The idea is the overcoming of the terror, not the happy solution to the disunity. Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi and I are at least in agreement concerning this aspect.<br />
						I have done a translation which I believe evades the pitfalls of this sutta and shows the way Gotama developed his idea.</p>

						<p>A variation on the teaching given in AN 3.65: The Kesaputtiya (Kesamutti) Suttaɱ aka The Kalama Sutta. Here, Old Man Nandako teaches two young brahmins not to go by what is accepted tradition, by hearsay, or great learning, not to go by logic and inference, the appeal of some theory, or because it is held by a venerated teacher, but only when a thing is understood for one's self to be beneficial, blameless, approved of by the wise, things that when done result in happiness and well-being undertake them and live by them. Examples of knowing for one's self are given.<br />
						The sutta ends with the phrase: '<i>brahmabhūtena attanā viharatī</i>' Which Bhk. Bodhi ("having himself become divine") and Bhk. Thanissaro: ("he abides [for the remainder of his last life-span] divinely pure in himself") are attempting to avoid translating as per Woodward: "...abides in experience of bliss, by becoming Brahma.' "Becoming Brahma" is problematic because of it's implication of a self having attained an individualized rebirth as 'a Brahma God' as this phrase is understood today by Hindu's. See on this: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.070.wood.pts.htm#n10">AN 3.070 n.10</a><br />
						What we have here is a good example of the difference between literal translation and interpretive translation. It is where the translator feels the need to interpret that bias can enter the picture and it is for this reason that the Pali Text Society translations are invaluable in that the predominant effort of these translators was in the direction of the literal because their primary interest (and measure of excellence) was in the usefulness of the translation in elucidating the language. Interpretation at some level can't be avoided in translation. This is just something to keep in mind as you read. Check back to the Pali where something doesn't feel right, where you suspect you are being molly-coddled, or where translators differ widely or where there is a suspicion that one is being pushed in a certain direction, especially towrads known biases, such as "There is no self."</p>

						<p>Ananda explains the disadvantages of Lust, Hate and Stupidity and the advantages of letting these things go to Channa the Wanderer. An essential feature of the Dhamma and the Nature of Nibbana is seen in this sutta where the advantages of letting go of Lust, Anger, and Stupidity are not stated in terms of gains but in terms of perception of not experiencing the disadvantages.<br />
						Woodward notes here about this sutta that it is the only instance in this volume of a nidana given as just: <i>'Sāvatthi-nidanaɱ.'</i> A nidana [the opening few lines of a sutta, usually making the statement that what is being said is a repetition of something heard about a teaching given by such and such a person, in such and such a place, under such and such circumstances] of some sort has frequently, but irregularly been inserted for the digital edition we are putting up here where each sutta needs to be able to stand alone and where the abrupt launching into a talk is jarring. Picking up the nidana of the first sutta in a chapter, or from the next previous sutta where a nidana is given, for the rest appears called for where the following suttas begin with <i>'Atha kho'</i>, 'There then'. Otherwise from the context and location of certain characters it is possible to deduce the nidana. Otherwise a generic beginning including only what is known has often, but not always been inserted.</p>

						<p>The Buddha shows how serious commitment to the training in ethical practices interacts with various levels of accomplishment in training the heart and training in wisdom to result in Streamwinning, Once-returning, Non-returning or Arahantship.</p>
						
						<p>Suttas 84-89 should be read together. The Buddha shows how serious commitment to the training in ethical practices interacts with various levels of accomplishment in training the heart and training in wisdom to result in Streamwinning, Once-returning, Non-returning or Arahantship. One who practices a little gets a little; one who practices thoroughly gets much. The fourth provides the definition of what constitutes the higher ethical practice, the higher training of the heart, and the higher training in wisdom. In AN 3.88 Woodward, in note <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.088.wood.pts.htm#n1">#1</a> points out the difficulty raised by the translation of <i>'citta'</i> as 'thought' rather than 'heart,' it's literal meaning. The higher <i>'citta'</i> is the training in <i>samādhi,</i> 'serenity', which is a state of the heart more than a state of the mind.<br />

						<p>While listening to the Buddha speak about the training rules, Kassapa bhikkhu thinks that Gotama goes too far along the lines of strict behavior. After the Buddha departs he has second thoughts and suffers regret mightily. He quickly goes to the Buddha to reveal his error. The revelation is acknowledged and he is given a teaching explaining the importance of being a good example. As well as being the teaching on being a good example, this is a good example of what is meant by 'confession' or 'apology' in the Buddha's system. It is really neither a confession nor an apology, but the making conscious of an error in the presence of a person of such a nature as will make the insident unforgettable and useful as a means for keeping check on one's future behavior. The 'revelation' is made either to the person to whom one has behaved badly or to some highly respected person. This is not easy to do but is powerful medicine! Take a person who habitually lies but who understands the danger in lying. The habit is hard to break when attacked head-on, but if such a one resolves to immediately 'confess' that what he has just said is a lie, the embarassment caused by that will quickly drive him to become more aware when he is speaking.</p>

						<p>The Buddha addresses the anxiousness of the bhikkhus to attain the goal by likening the training to the three basic tasks of the farmer: plowing the field, sowing the seed, and irrigation. In the same way that these three tasks are under the control of the farmer, the training is under the control of the bhikkhu; in the same way as the growth of the crop is out of the hands of the farmer; the time of attaining the goal is out of the hands of the bhikkhu. Nevertheless there is expecation of results in both cases. Very similar to AN 3.82.</p>

						<p>The Buddha compares the practice of living in solitude of those of other views with the practice of living in solitude of those who follow this Dhamma and Discipline. Then he compares the results of this practice with the steps the farmer goes through to harvest and secure his crop. This sutta describes a course to non-returning based on the practice of seclusion and having cultivated the first <i>jhāna</i> wherein the first three <i>saŋyojana</i> are broken and further there is a restraining of <i>abhijjhāya</i> and <i>vyāpādena</i> (Woodward's coveting and malevolance). Note that the usual fourth <i>saŋyojana</i> is, <i>kāmacchanda</i> so that what may be being said is that the restraint of coveting is the essential aspect of wishing for sense pleasures that must at least restrained to attain non-returning.<br />
						The BJT and CSCD pali and Bhk. Bodhi break this sutta into two at section 4. The BJT Pali has this section include all four Jhānas; the CSCD and the Pali apparently followed by Bhk. Bodhi have, as is the case with the PTS Pali, only the first Jhāna. Except for following what was done before, there is no sense to breaking the sutta into two at this point.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi notes that the commentary wants to deny that this is a non-returner, but all the commentary does is invent the name 'jhāna-non-returner' and define this in the same way as the non-returner is defined which is just what the sutta does. The essential thing the commentary wants to inject into the thinking about this is that this non-returner does not enter a Brahma-loka or the Pure Abodes, but goes to some <i>kāma</i> world (that would include the Tusita realm) and attains Final <i>Nibbāna</i> there. There is nothing in the sutta itself to confirm or deny this, but attainment of the Brahma Lokas is said to be done by way of attaining the first <i>jhāna</i> even for commoners. Add this to the picture of the non-returner in the outline above. This is a good example of the kind of mess you can get into trusting the commentaries to explain things.</p>

						<p>The Buddha compares the process of attaining the higher mind through meditation to the steps required for the refining of gold. The goldsmith balances use of heat, cooling and examination; the bhikkhu must balance his development of serenity, energy and detachment. In the same way that over-emphasis of one aspect of the process by the goldsmith will likely result in the ruination of the gold, the over-emphasis by the bhikkhu on samadhi will result in sloth, overemphasis on energy building will result in anxiety, and overemphasis on objective detachment will result in the lack of serenity necessary to end the corrupting influences.

						<p>The Buddha says that singing is just lamentation, dancing is just madness, and laughter is just childishness. Destroy the bridge, he says, to singing and dancing; It is enough, if something is really worthy of rejoicing, to simply smile.<br />
						The Buddha says to 'break the bridge' that is singing and dancing. The meaning is that singing and dancing and laughter are reactions to sense stimulus. They are the making of new kamma. There is the sense stimulus and then there follows after an expression which is a statement about that sense stimulus. For the Arahant if what is perceived is worthy, a response is called for, not a reaction. Such is the importance of the word <i>'sataɱ'</i> 'to mind, or remember', that is to consider and respond rather than react. This is what is going on in back of several cases we encounter in the suttas where the Buddha smiles and Ananda understands this to be significant and worthy of inquiry as to it's cause. [See for example: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.081.horn.pts.htm">MN 81</a><br />
						As for 'the bridge' the meaning is that which is a stepping-stone to rebirth: sexual intercourse.</p>

Bodhi here "fail", Woodward (in this sutta) 'Warped' and 'askew' with a footnote explaining. I suggest what we have here in this sutta is the basic intended meaning as it would be understood throughout the world wherever there is construction using wood, that is as Woodward has it, for English, "warped". I suggest the derivation is: via apada; via the not-path. For the behavior and mental state: deviance, for the opposite: not-warped or straight or just as good "warped" and "not-warped" for all cases. In terms of the <i>saŋyojanas,</i> this would mean behavior and thinking that deviated from the Magga ... not just malevolance.</p>

Lust arises and is intentionally abandoned, got rid of, exterminated, ended, understood to such a degree as to cause detachment from it, to stop it in it's tracks, to see it coming before it arises and thereby to end kamma. Lust can be not acted upon. Ditto <i>dosa</i> and <i>moha</i>.</p>

						<p>Three things from which originate actions, kamma, karma. This is the reverse case of the previous. This pairing of opposites is a frequent practice in the suttas precisely for situations like this where an exact understanding of the terms must be had to put them in both positive and negative form or they turn the sutta into a mess. Woodward notes that here 'Nidana' as 'cause' doesn't work but he uses 'cause'. Bhk. Bodhi also uses 'cause'. It's an ego thing. A reflection of <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's problem</a>. The arrogance of the ego that at heart thinks it is God the Creator of the Created: the cause of all this. It's inconceivable that things arise without being 'caused'. How come? "Because I can see that I exist, and I can see that things arise in the world as I become conscious of them and therefore I am the cause of things arising in the world." But: "This being, that becomes," is not a causual relationship, it's an associative relationship. The beginning of both this and the previous sutta is: "There are these three nidana giving rise to kamma," Here the three are not-lust, etc. Using 'cause' we are saying that a not-thing is the cause of an action. If we understand Nidana to mean, 'bound up in, tied to, (rises in association with)' we then have a sensible translation: Lust is tied to (even based on, even dependent on) the origination of kamma. Not-lust is tied to the origination of kamma. Any kamma tied to lust is no good, any deed not tied to lust is good. In the second case the kamma is the intentional not-doing of any action based on lust. Kamma which ends kamma.</p>

						<p>#109 and 110 provide a variation on the previous two suttas, also a pair of opposites. The Buddha describes how desire for things in the past, future and present provide three bases for the arising of kamma. One sort of kamma brings a bad result, the other a good result. Note here the order 'past, future present.' This is the standard throughout the suttas, which I say is the case because the mind is a suggestable, ever evolving thing which is by this order pointed into the past, pointed into the future, but made to land in the present. The order used here [USA] today [Monday, March 10, 2014 6:02 AM]; 'past, present, future', shows a mechanical, hierarchical thinking which has the effect of causing the whole population to focus mindlessly on the future, neither learning from the past nor paying attention to (or even enjoying) the present. Get the education to get the job to get the money to get the things that will show everyone else that one is more future oriented than everyone else. Fast tracking, trend setting, fad followers. The latest hairstyle, skirt-length, shoe, college, industry, location, number of children, ... house, car, telephone, radio, tv, hi-fi, walkman, computer. Faster and faster. Faster, smaller, cheaper ... better? Nobody sees they are out of date before they start, they die hoping to leap-frog the next generation. Like sheep they go to the slaughter. They never looked back to see that in the end they have done nothing, what they got comes to nothing. Round and round and round and round, they drive themselves into the ground. Both Woodward and the BJT Pali make errors not keeping this ordering in mind.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes what constitutes failure and success in ethical practices, heart, and viewpoint in this dhamma-discipline. Check out your concepts of failure and success against this list. Note that in this sutta <i>'sammādiṭṭhi'</i> is not defined in terms of the four truths. I have suggested elsewhere that it was likely the definition as given here that was originally understood as High View, and the Four thruths were considered a separate doctrine, included in the Magga only when that is presented as the Seeker's Path, or the Non-seeker's Path where it has ten 'folds' and there as the Ninth fold and then in terms of the Paticca Samuppada. This does not make any difference in terms of doctrine. This sutta as it stands is directed at the commoner interested in avoiding hell and sub-human states and desiring rebirth in pleasant worlds.<br />
						Neither Woodward nor Bhk. Bodhi comment on this or quote commentary. Bhk. Bodhi translates <i>'sammādiṭṭhi'</i> here as 'correct perspective'. The fact that this was left as it is argues strongly against significant changes being made by early editors.</p>

						<p>Three types of action which land one in Hell and three which land one in a heavenly State. The title of this sutta in the Pali is <i>'Akusala'</i>. This term is most frequently translated 'unskillful'. 'Sin'; to commit an offense against (God or Law), is not really a Buddhist concept; actions have consequences in accordance with the intent of the actor and the same act can produce various consequences so the idea is really skill at recognizing the intent with which an action is being taken and judging that the consequences will be in accord with that intent and taking the appropriate, or skillful, course. Bhk Bodhi translates as 'Unwholesome.' The synonym is 'unwise.' The term for the converse is <i>'Kusala'</i> which Woodward translates as 'Righteous' which suffers from the same bias and unrelatedness to the Pali as his 'sinful'.<br />
						Woodward footnotes <i>Yathābhataɱ,</i> his 'according to his deserts' and Bhk. Bodhi's 'as if brought there' The whole phrase is <i>yathābhataɱ nikkhitto evaɱ niraye/saggeti.</i> YATHA = like, as, according to; BHATA = support; NIKKHITTA; laid down: 'thus laid down according to support.' The image is of one who is falling (having been 'cast' by his acts) through space and finds a landing place that supports him. So: "Having these three sorts of behavior he is thus placed in ~ such being in accordance with his level of support.</p>

Bodhi use 'blameworthy' and 'blameless.' The consequences of one's acts are not in accordance with the will of another but follow on their intent to cause pleasant or unpleasant or not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant experiences. Not all things held to be blameworthy are faulty and not all things held to be blameless are faultless. Blame is a moral judgment and morality derives it's authority not from a view-based standard of ethical behavior but on popular opinion. One 'fears blame', as a practical matter but trying to determine what is and what is not an act that will further one's progress towards the goal of the Dhamma using 'blame' as a standard is risky.</p>

						<p>The three modes of attacking the problem of 'pain' (dukkha) in existence: hedonistic self-indulgence, self-torture, and the middle way. The first two are called 'the two extremes' of practice.

Essentially the entire Dhamma is a Middle Way. The idea of 'middle' being that in stead of acting in one way or the other, one abstains from acting in either way. This is intentional not-doing, not 'doing nothing'! It has a kammic result which is the ending of a kammic stream.</p>

						<p class="f4">In understanding the sutta however the best course would be to read it as separate suttas. That would mean that the middle way that avoides hedonistic self-indulgence and self-torture would be being <i>variously</i> defined as:<br />
						1. (in the previous sutta) as the four settings-up of memory [<i>saṭipaṭṭhānas</i>, not so named],<br />
						2. the four best efforts [<i>padhānāni</i>, not so named],<br />
						3. the four paths to magic powers [<i>iddipāda</i>],<br />
						4. the the controlling forces [<i>indriya</i>],<br />
						5. the controlling powers [<i>bala</i>],<br />
						6. the seven dimensions of self-awakening, [<i>sambojjhaŋga</i>],<br />
						7. the eight-fold path (not so named).<br />
						As for the interesting questions this raises ... well:<br />
						Was this the original understanding of the Middle Way, or a later construction. Assuming this was a later construction, when reading the first sutta one must ask how it was so effective when it did not define the terms in the Way, nor did it define the Four Truths as <i>'Sammā Diṭṭhi'</i>.<br />
						This is the group of 'Dhammas' that is understood to be the 'Dhamma' which is to be set up and remembered as 'living in the Dhamma observing the Dhamma', aka the fourth satipatthana. This could explain the apparent confusion in the collections which I would put back in order this way: Both 151 and 152+ are one sutta. The statement is that the Middle way is: The Four Satipatthanas. The Fourth Satipatthana is then further defined (And what, beggars, is living in the Dhamma, overseeing the Dhamma? Herein a beggar ..." remembers to develop items 2-7. ... but in this case, how was <i>'Sammā Diṭṭhi'</i> defined, and if as usual in this book, where are the Four Truths?<br />
						This is all just fun speculation, there needs to be no doubt as to doctrine as with some effort it can be shown that each of these seven Dhammas are equal to each of the others. The Buddha once said that if four wise men were to sit down to question him in turn taking breaks only for food, sleep and the calls of nature, they would all be dead and gone before he had come to the end of the possible ways the four satipatthanas could be constructed. See: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.012.horn.pts.htm#fn89">MN 12</a> where this statement is made.)</p>

						<p>A wheel sutta memory exercise playing off Lust, hate, stupidity, anger, grudge-bearing, deception, ruthlessness, irritation, selfishness, illusion, treachery, stubbornness, quarrellousness, madness, conceit, intoxication and carelessness against higher knowledge, comprehensive knowledge, utter destruction, letting go, waining, putting down, eradication, disposal and rejection. The solution for each set is the development of the states of emptiness, signlessness and purposelessness.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi following the Pali as found in CSCD has this as 170 suttas; the PTS (Pali and translation) has it as one sutta. This version could reasonably be broken into 17 suttas and even more likely considering the pattern followed later in the AN, into the 170 suttas of the CSCD and Bhk. Bodhi versions. However I have followed the PTS Pali. As an exercise it should certainly be one unit, however one sub-divides it.</p>
