					<p>The Buddha explains how when faith, sense of shame, fear-of-blame, energy and wisdom are established as instinctive responses, unskillful states find it impossible to gain access.<br />
					The word to understand here is <i>paccupa-ṭ-ṭhitā.</i> PED: <i>Paccupa-ṭ-ṭhita</i> [pp. of <i>paccupa-ṭ-ṭhahati; [paṭi + upa + sthā]</i> "to stand up before," to be present;] (re)presented, offered, at one's disposal, imminent, ready, present. I would say rather to have at one's disposal (uprising, <i>upa</i>) the reflex <i>(paṭi)</i> previously established <i>(<i>sthā,</i> stood up)</i> of ... In other words at the first appearance of danger, faith etc. reflexively also appears: what we call an 'instinctive response' or 'muscle response' a habitual response recollected more by the musculature than through thought processes. Hare: "is set on"; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: "is securely settled in."<br />
					The point is to give assurance that one has not fallen off track simply because one is harassed in mind by unskillful things; as long as the skills of faith, etc. have been thoroughly ingrained in one's thought processes they will come forward and the skillful will prevail.</p>

						<p>The Buddha outlines the progressive interdependence of ethical behavior, serenity, knowing and seeing, disenchantment and dispassion, and knowing and seeing freedom. Hare who previously used 'insight' for '<i>paññā,'</i> 'wisdom', here uses 'insight' for <i>'dassana,'</i> seeing, so it is necessary to discover which he is referring to when you encounter this term in his translations. He has translated the final step, <i>'vimutti-ñāṇa-dassana'</i> 'emancipated knowledge and insight.' <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi (more correctly) here has: 'knowledge and vision of liberation.' Literally: 'freedom-knowledge-seeing'. Where having known and seen freedom as freedom does result in emancipated knowledge and freedom, what is being spoken of in this sutta is the consequence of having dispassion and disenchantment. The immediate result of that is knowing and seeing freedom. It is not sufficient to attain freedom. One must know that one is free and know that this freedom is the freedom one has been seeking. Otherwise there will be nothing to prevent recrudescence of existence and birth. The earlier 'knowing and seeing' is the knowing and seeing of the Four Truths or the seeing of and approval of the theory, an achievement of the Streamwinner.</p>

						<p>Consummate <i>Samādhi</i> described as consisting of five dimensions (the four usual <i>jhānas</i> and observation of the signs) and yielding skill in the higher knowledges.<br />
						This description has with it the similes which are very helpful in visualizing the progression of the <i>jhānas.</i> [see also for these: <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p39">MN 39,</a><a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77">MN 77</a>] However Hare's translation reflects neither vision nor a close adherence to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and messes up the imagery to the point of uselessness. Hare has especially botched up the simile for the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> and to complicate that, either he has translated it backwards or there was an editorial error which reverses the meaning. The descriptions of the <i>jhānas</i> and the similes that accompany them are not simply descriptions or recipes, they are also hypnotic suggestions which draw one into the <i>jhāna.</i> All their magic is lost if the repeated phrases are not repeated exactly and if the ordering of the words does not reflect the progressive deepening of the experience. See <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#first_burning">'The First Burning'</a> and following for my version.<br />
						In this sutta the fifth item (observing the signs) is one that is not seen elsewhere connected with <i>Sammā Samādhi</i> or the mastery of higher powers and it meaning here is subject to question. There is no support in the sutta itself for the idea that this is paying attention to a concentration device, or the so called 'reflex image,' or to the subject of one's meditation. I believe the key is in the simile which is of a man observing another man while standing, observing while standing another man who is sitting, and sitting observing another man who is lying down. I believe what is being observed is the body and its state of serenity and that there is, in the idea of 'a man', a <i>symbolic imagery</i> for mnemonic purposes which is humorous. Note that the final, always the highest state, is supine.</p>

						<p>The Buddha explains to his attendant Nagita why he will not accept the food-gifts of a large number of people who have gathered together to do him homage on hearing of his arrival in their town.<br />
						It is interesting to try and understand the reasoning here as elsewhere the Buddha goes to great lengths to encourage giving. The distinction appears to be that these people have not arrived to hear <i>Dhamma,</i> but only to 'see' the Buddha and make merit by giving their gifts.<br />
						The key word to understand in this sutta is <i>samāgama.</i> Hare: 'homage'; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: 'honor'; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'fame', PED: 'intercourse. <i>saṇ</i> = own, with, con; <i>āgama</i> = to cause to come. In the text Gotama indicates that it is a word for gains, honors, and fame. I think 'homage' covers more of this territory than 'honor' or 'fame.' Gotama apparently perceives the motives of the group as consisting of empty homage.<br />
						We know from the fact that Nāgita was at this time Gotama's attendant, that this is an early event, so this supports the idea that in the early stages of the Buddha's career the meditation practice of choice was apparently the contemplation of the unpleasant and the disadvantages of existence rather than minding the breathing.<br />
						We don't know much about Nāgita except that he was supposed to have been fat and lazy. See also: <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p42">AN 6.42</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p86">AN 8.86</a></p>

I wonder where and why the idea of giving the names of both male and female lines fell off. Ancient India and some cultures, and the ancient European aristocracy preserve this system. There was a movement here for a while to use hyphenated names, but I believe this was more a desire to appear aristocratic than to restore gender equality and for that reason it seems to have been a passing fad.</p>

						Hare quotes the Commentary: living a generous, ethical life guided by wisdom. Elsewhere in the suttas themselves long life is said to be got through harmlessness, beauty through being good tempered, honor through non-envy and respect of others, and rebirth in heaven through giving and mental culture. Generosity alone is also mentioned as yielding all these results. And wisdom would guide one to doing all these things if for no other reason than covering one's bets.</p>

						<p>Pasenadi, king of Kosala is visiting the Buddha when he is told of the death of his chief Queen, Mallika. He is very upset and Gotama instructs him with the distinction between the disciples of Gotama and the commoner in facing aging, sickness and death, passing away, and disappearance.<br />
						The instruction is identical with the previous sutta. It is very difficult for us in the West to see how this sort of response to a person in grief could be understood as compassion. I have personally faced the situation and not been able to respond as directly as in this example. The best I could come up with was to say that "In the ancient system of the Buddha the response to a person in grief was to say something like 'It is the destiny of all personal things to come to an end.' And then explain that however much grief might be being felt, what it came down to was that this was not grief for the dead person, but grief for the self missing the companionship of the dead person, and that by letting go of this display of grief he would be saving himself useless and embarrassing display of self-pity. The idea that the display of grief is a joy to one's enemies and a pain to one's friends is also a strong argument in this situation.</p>

						<p class="in1"><b>&#35;<a id="p51" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/05_fives/an05.051.pali.bd.htm">51. <i>Nīvaraṇa Suttaṃ,</i></a> III.63</b></p>

						<p>The Buddha likens a person mastered by wishing for sense pleasure, hate, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling, and doubt and vacillation (the <i>nivaranas</i> — diversions) to a stream which has been diverted and no longer has its original strength or free will. Then he likens a person who has mastered desire for sense pleasures, hatred, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling and doubt and vacillation to a stream whose diversions have been closed off and which has regained its strength and free will.<br />
						Once again the simile points the way to the correct translation of <i>'nivarana',</i> that is, 'diversion' or that which diverts. The majority of translators use 'hindrance', but it can be seen from the simile that what is being spoken of is not an obstruction (another translation that has been used) but something that is siphoning off the forward momentum of the stream. I think we can see here a difference in the mentality of this day and age [USA, Sunday, July 13, 2014 11:47 AM A.D.] from that of the followers of Gotama in his day and age [c.500 B.C.], that is the tendency to put off our problems onto the world or others. That which obstructs does not involve the will of the individual or necessarily reduce his strength and freedom, whereas diversions are by their nature participated in by the individual and to whatever degree that is so weaken his strength and diminish his individual willpower.</p>

						This is but one of several different descriptions The Buddha relates of the method he used to attain arahantship. Is there contradiction in this? No. There is overlap.

For example, see if you can see how understanding the satisfaction, the danger, and the escape from <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/salayatana.htm">the six-fold sense sphere</a> is the same thing as developing and experiencing <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm">psychic power</a> culminating in the destruction of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas.</i></a> Then do the same thing with the experience of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/paticca_samuppada.htm"><i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i></a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_saccani.htm">the Four Aristocratic Truths,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_satipatthana.htm">the Four Settings up of Mind,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">the Seven Dimensions of Self-Awakening,</a> etc.</p>

						The final phrase: <i>maranasanna kho pan'assa ajjhattam supatthita hoti,</i> translated by Hare: "... and the thought of death is by him inwardly well established," accords with the usual understanding. My interpretation is that this term <i>"ajjhattam"</i> is used to avoid the term "his own" or "own" "personal". But here it may have lead to a misunderstanding of the intent, which I believe is the fact that one has come to see that "My own body" too will die, has not risen above that state, is subject to such an end as that.

						<p>The Buddha explains the meaning of 'living in the <i>Dhamma'.</i> It is not enough to study the suttas, teach the <i>Dhamma,</i> repeat the suttas, think about the <i>Dhamma,</i> but one must also have the wisdom to grasp the attainment of the goal itself.<br />
						My version of this incorporates the idea of going-apart found in the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/05_fives/an05.074.pali.bd.htm">AN 5.73</a> variation on this sutta and summarizes including all the steps. This appears to me to be the way it was intended to have been presented because of the way the final paragraph is worded in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> which looks like an incomplete unabridgment. I have therefore called this, and my version of <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/05_fives/an05.073.olds.bd.htm">AN 5.73</a> 'retellings'.<br />
						A significant feature of this sutta is the fact that the attainment of the goal is through the application of wisdom <i>(paññā).</i> Wisdom is a matter of taking known knowledge and experience and coming up with a solution to a problem, answer to a question, method for attaining a goal; knowing what to do. It isn't really the discovery of anything new, such as with insight. It is more a matter of having the heart for the attainment. The use of will-power and resolution to overcome reluctance to attain what one already knows can be attained and how it can be attained. Here we have an explanation for the idea of 'sudden awakening' for which we have an example in Ānanda's awakening at the last minute before he is called upon to recite <i>Dhamma</i> at the first council where he thinks to himself that he himself ought to become Arahant before joining this auspicious assembly of Arahants, and he becomes arahant there and then.</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens the struggle to awaken to a battle, and enumerates five sorts of warriors and their parallels in the community of <i>bhikkhus.</i><br />
						Bhk. Thanissaro notes that this discourse is directed at the <i>bhikkhus</i> and speculates that the image of the warrior was designed to appeal to masculine pride and that perhaps some other approach would have been taken with the <i>bhikknuni's.</i> I would point to the way the members of Don Juan's group, so closely aligned with the ancient tradition of the warrior, male and female alike all took pride in the warrior image. History, from ancient times down to gang warfare in New York City in the early 1900s, gives us plenty of examples of women warriors. Here this struggle for awakening is as much a battle for women as for men. The appeal, in the use of the warrior image, is to the courage of the warrior, not his masculinity. The appeal to feminists as well as to male chauvinists is to put sexual identification to the side. Both sexes are the devil to the other.</p>

							<p>"Sir Joshua Reynolds once asked him [Johnson] by what means he had attained his extraordinary accuracy and flow of language. He told him, that he had early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his best on every occasion, and in every company: to impart whatever he knew in the most forcible language he could put it in; and that by constant practice, and never suffering any careless expressions to escape him, or attempting to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the clearest manner, it became habitual to him."<br />

						<p class="f4">A short sutta but one that teaches an extremely helpful discipline. Hare translates the Lion's reason for his care no matter what the prey by 'Let not my skill fail me!' but it would be better as 'Let not my skill deteriorate!'. The lesson is that the important thing is the skill with which one acts, not the circumstances in which one acts. Lazy habits infect one's entire practice. This world is like a vast swiftly-flowing river; a slight change in a small object may not appear to have an immediate effect, but in a short time it will have exerted some influence on every molecule of that on-going flow.

						<p>The Buddha lists five things which make a <i>bhikkhu</i> one who is a garland for <i>bhikkhus</i>.<br />
						In this sutta Gotama uses himself as an example of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who embodies various qualities which make a <i>bhikkhu</i> a garland for <b>bhikkhus.</b> Self-praise is not a quality which is held in high esteem, so how do we excuse this in the Buddha? By understanding the realization of not-self as having been truly accomplished in him, hence it is not self-praise, it is the praise of the phenomena of 'Buddha', Awakening. He speaks of himself as though of another person. A sutta like this should be used to inspire faith in the reader. Think of how difficult, stupid and transparently phoney (uninspiring) it would be for one to make statements like this if this were not the case of an individual speaking of himself like this without being completely without ego. This is also a good example of how naturally 'conventional speech' is to be used.</p>

						This is not, as Hare would have it, not needing to train; this is the situation of one who has already mastered the training. Contrasted to the previous the idea is that the <i>bhikkhu</i> that is earnestly studying is worthy as here one who is an adept is worthy. Being in the condition of beggars, the <i>bhikkhus</i> are constantly being reminded by Gotama to be worthy of accepting their sustenance from those who labor for their living. There is a huge respect for the weight, that is to say, difficulty, of sustaining life, which is to say, the bearing of pain for life's sake. It is enough to do it for one's self and family; to do it for an unworthy stranger is heroic. 'Worthy' meaning that the <i>kammic</i> rebound should greatly exceed that of an ordinary person; a thing which is effected by detachment, which is the result of virtue, etc. For the unworthy, bumming off the labors of others is a swift road to hell and is especially so for the <i>bhikkhus</i> of Gotama's <i>Saṅgha</i> because in this case there is a high expectation of bountiful return (one gets to see and experience the pain and disappointment one has allowed another to suffer for one ... multiplied a few hundred thousand fold).</p>

One needs to overcome one's reactions to the sight of an attractive person of the opposite sex. The scent of food cooking on the barbeque next door. We need to be calm, cool, collected, impassive.

						I object to Hare's (and most other translators') 'right' for <i>'sammā'</i> because its meaning as 'upright' or 'straight' is misunderstood to be 'the only correct thing' whereas the meaning is 'the best' or 'highest' or 'consummate' thing.

And that is the problem, for it is that idea which has plagued mankind and especially religious freedom since forever. <i>'Sammā'</i> and <i>'micchā'</i> are concepts of efficacy relative to the goal.

If you believe 'this Way' is right and all other ways are wrong, you are attached to both the wrong and the consummate and misunderstand both and unless you let that position go you cannot achieve the detachment needed for freedom and the goal. Period. Words have power. "The pen is mightier than the sward." (Bulwer-Litton) Etc. "Right" and "Wrong" as absolutes have dealt nothing but grief to this world. Their use in Buddhist translations is out of place and entirely a consequence of the early Christian-biased translations of the PTS such as this. Correcting the error is a matter of overcoming misplaced fear of and respect for the authority of the Oxford scholars. The Oxford scholars themselves would be the first to say they were fumbling in the dark and we have evidence enough right here to see that they were all too human, not Arahants, and subject to human error. The other hindrance to getting this ... um ... going in the optimal direction is that translators wish to avoid controversy and to find acceptance but this is nothing but pandering to the low minded and is no way to 'guide the flock'. We need to let these terms go!</p>

						<p>The Buddha compares the rule of a monarch and the Teacher to the rolling of wheels. The factors that make for the lasting rule of a monarch are similar to those that made for the lasting of the <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
						Hare has both the monarch and the <i>Tathāgata</i> knowing <i>Dhamma</i> with a capital 'D'. This is probably the way this should be done throughout. We capitalize 'Tao.' Both the King and the <i>Tathāgata</i> follow 'good form', which was known as 'the <i>Dhamma</i>'. What Gotama taught was that <i>Dhamma</i> as he saw it hence it came to be known as 'the <i>Dhamma</i>'. We should probably say 'The <i>Dhamma</i> according to Gotama' when speaking specifically of the teachings, but reverence for Gotama as well as appreciation for the perfect conformity of the Teachings with Good Form have blurred the difference. Otherwise when the meaning of the term is an ordinary thing, we should use lower case.<br />
						Hare cites the commentary when explaining the understanding of what 'knowing times' means. This needs to be understood in the case of the Monarch as knowing the appropriate time to speak or maintain silence (when an idea will best be received), knowing the time for military or diplomatic action or when to remain inactive, when to bestow gifts and honors, and so forth.</p>

						<p>Five things which lead to losing release that is attained and five things that lead to preserving release that is attained.<br />
						The term to understand in this sutta is <i>'samaya,' sam</i> = 'on' or 'with' <i>aya:</i> time, age, while. The 'Once upon a Time' or 'at one time' or 'once' of <i>Nidana's.</i> Temporal release; not temporary release; although the subject of the sutta is temporary release. Once in a while. The contemporary Indian English: 'Once in a way.' <i>vimutti</i> = freedom. The thing itself is not a mystery: having let go of some attachment, after the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms have passed off, reflecting on the bondage one had to a past habit one experiences a sense of freedom. This is often a matter of a profound sense of freedom accompanied by a 'sigh of relief.' If this is carefully examined, it is seen to be the whole process of attaining Arahantship in a nutshell. This has lead to problems. There are those who experiencing the more profound variety of these releases come to the conclusion they are Arahants. This leads to a second conclusion: that Arahants can fall back. This, according to <i>Points of Controversy</i> Of Falling Away, (which I am not going to post here as it is a long argument concerning a special situation that is easily summarized as I am doing here) was a position taken at one point by the Sammitiyas, the Vajjiputtiyas, the Sabbatthivādans, and some of the Mahāsanghikas. The most likely explanation of the controversy is that there were, at the time, multiple definitions of the term Arahant. It was a term sometimes used as an honorific for ordinary persons of distinction. It was commonly used of any wandering ascetic. We see this here and there in the <i>Suttas</i> in the terms used by outsiders. However in Gotama's system as defined in the <i>Suttas</i> the Arahant is an individual who has attained <i>Nibbāna</i> in this life in such a way as eliminates any possibility of sliding back. This term then is to be applied to and is a valuable instruction for those who have not yet attained Arahantship.</p>

						<p>Five things which result in hatred here and hell hereafter and five things that free one from hatred here and hell hereafter.<br />
						This is an expansion on the previous. Elsewhere termed 'the five-fold guilty dread' [<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.092.wood.pts.htm">AN 10 92</a>], 'the five-fold dread and hatred' [<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/09_nines/an09.027.hare.pts.htm">AN 9.27</a>]. So far no one's translation makes good sense. The five actions are not the five guilty dreads, they are the sources of the guilty dreads. For the obvious case: The man who 'goes to another man's wife' is the source of the hatred directed at him by the husband, going to another man's wife is not itself hatred. ... though there will be those practitioners of modern psychology who will say that going to another man's wife is subconscious hatred of the other man. So who knows? <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi translates: 'five perils and enmities' which comes closer. The idea is 'fearful hate-makers'.</p>

						<p>The Buddha and Sariputta team up to teach Anāthapiṇḍika and his retinue of 500 lay disciples the advantages of seclusion.<br />
						This sutta is interesting in that it points to the key factor that identifies the first <i>jhāna:</i> the appreciation <i>(pīti)</i> or enjoyment or zest for solitude. <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro has translated <i>(pīti)</i> as 'rapture'. This is not technically an incorrect translation in that the term covers a spectrum of meanings from 'mild interest' through 'excitement, enthusiasm, zest, love, passionate interest and 'rapture.' However as this is an instruction being given to laymen, and apparently being given to them for the first time, to suggest that such should 'from time to time' just, snap-fingers, enter rapture over being in solitude is not realistic and is unlikely to have been the intent. The practice of this system is going to be the most difficult thing anyone has ever attempted, there is no good served by making it appear more difficult than it is.</p>

						<p>Five trades, modes of livelihood, manners of making a living that should not be undertaken by a Buddhist Lay Follower. Notice here the use of broad general or generic terms for the various occupations thus rendering the list less subject to time. 'Swords' is to imply weapons. It could have been 'knives', but knives are sometimes not used as weapons. Trade in living beings implies more than the slave trade and includes trade in animals raised for slaughter. Trade in 'limbs' or 'members' (parts) points to the role of the butcher. The instruction is not to engage in the selling of meat; there is no prohibition against the eating of meat. This is the tactic used in all such issues. This is the tactic used in the case of the trade in maddening drugs. At the time alcohol was the only problem drug but the term points to the real issue: any substance which causes a person to loose good judgment.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the value of ethical conduct by asking the <i>bhikkhus</i> if they had ever heard of or seen the punishment of persons who had given up unethical conduct being punished because of their having given up unethical conduct. Then he asks if they had ever heard of or seen the punishment of persons who had engaged in unethical conduct being punished because of their having engaged in unethical conduct.<br />
						This sutta is valuable because it throws some light on what is meant by the five basic rules of ethical conduct. For example, the harm of lying is shown to be a matter of the lie having caused material damage. There is considerable controversy concerning the meaning of the prohibition of 'drinks fermented and distilled'. This is clearly alcohols, but others today, concerned with 'the drug problem' argue that the drug which they are particularly against should be included. Here we see that the important factor to consider is not the substance but the behavior of one using the substance. If, under the influence of such and such a thing, one kills, steals, lies, or engages in misconduct in the pursuit of pleasure, then that thing should be given up. Probably we should include 'in the pursuit of obtaining, where it is illegal' — for some drugs, like heroin, inspire such fear of withdrawal that where the drug is not freely available the addict will engage in unethical behavior that is not evident when the drug is easily available — witness the 6% of Medical Doctors addicted to morphine whose behavior, because their drug of choice is easily available to them, is exemplary. From the Buddhist perspective this choice of behaviors, these 'rules' are a personal matter, 'good advice', not a matter of judging others or making laws.<br />
						Note that this advice is being directed to laymen. It is here a matter of living while evading the gross danger of worldly punishment. It does not yet reach up to the advantages of ethical conduct in avoiding rebirth in disagreeable states, avoiding unpleasant company, securing solitude, entering the <i>jhānas,</i> or attaining liberation. Anyone, whatever their beliefs, ought to be able to see the sense of these rules.</p>

						<p>Brahman Dona comes to Gotama intending to criticize him for not rising up for Brahmins and is given an education as to various sorts of Brahmins.<br />
						In various places in the <i>Suttas,</i> Brahmins approach Gotama telling him that they have heard that he does not rise up for elder Brahmins. They, being old Brahmins, see that he does not rise up for them, criticize him for his lack of courtesy and are usually given a lecture on what constitutes an 'elder' or the person who should be shown such veneration. That is, their criticism is answered directly. Here Dona, who is apparently not an old Brahman, but simply Brahmin born and educated, observes that Gotama does not rise up for him and concludes that what he has heard is correct and launches into his criticism. But here Gotama's response is very subtle. He speaks to Dona of the doctrines laid out by Dona's own authorities concerning what constitutes Brahmin worthy of veneration. Dona recognizes that he does not fit the description of the worthy sorts of Brahmins and he is so impressed with Gotama's subtlety and knowledge that he is converted. Another wonderful example of Gotama's skill as a teacher.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches a method for escape from a heart of lust, anger, cruelty, and obsession with form and individuality.<br />
						This is a sutta that deals with a method we come across here and there but not very often: the idea of escaping one set of ideas by intentionally focusing on another set. Bhk Thanissaro has done a translation which is more readable than Hare's but which does not forcefully make the point that it is switching from one set of ideas to another set of ideas that is the way to 'set right' the heart. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has also missed this point apparently misunderstanding the Commentary. One departs thoughts of lust by placing the mind on thoughts of giving up. It is not that one has thoughts of lust that do not satisfy <i>and</i> one has thoughts of giving up that do satisfy <i>and</i> when his mind departs from lust it is freed; it is noticing that when one has thoughts of lust they do not satisfy and when one has thoughts of giving up they satisfy and when thoughts of lust arise one escapes them by departing from the thoughts of lust by focusing on the thoughts of giving up.</p>

						Don Juan deals with sleep and dreaming from within, making the effort of his practice becoming conscious from within the dream; the Buddhist practice is to bring sleep down to the absolute minimum and to completely ignore dreaming with the result that waking life assumes at will the plasticity of dreams and in sleep one remains fully conscious. In the middle is the exercise of command over the sleeping mind through pre-sleep programming. "Let me retain full consciousness while sleeping and dreaming." "Let there be no erotic content, anxiety-provoking content, or evil thoughts in my dreams." "Let me waken at the first appearance of erotic content ... ." etc.</p>

						<p>Five disadvantages for a <i>bhikkhu</i> that visits with families.<br />
						Hare has rendered his translation understanding that the <i>bhikkhu</i> is offending the family by various things; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi seems to have the more reasonable translation indicating that these are offences against the rules for <i>bhikkhus.</i><br />
						The offense of teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six <i>'vācāhi'</i> [voicings] is interesting. First of all, <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi translates <i>'vācāhi'</i> as sentences whereas Hare has 'words'. Elsewhere I recall this being translated 'verses'. Neither translator explains the <i>Vinaya.</i> The idea is, I believe, found in the phenomena we can observe at talks where the enrapturing power of eloquent speech acts as an aphrodisiac with certain women and where, consequently, the <i>bhikkhu</i> without great self-control might find himself in danger, or, as Hare might understand it, greatly upset a husband or father. The Buddha himself was exempt from the rule and the <i>bhikkhus</i> regularly taught the <i>bhikkhunis,</i> so perhaps this rule applies only to <i>bhikkhus</i> speaking to lay women. I wonder how this rule applies today when a <i>bhikkhu</i> speaks to a group that may include persons of both sexes.</p>

						<p>The advantages of serving the main meal before the noon hour has passed versus the disadvantages of serving it at a later time.<br />
						<i>Ussūra-bhatte.</i> After the sun is fully risen, that is, noon to one o'clock. No food after the time when the shadow cast by an upright stick in India is two-finger-widths past where it makes no shadow (noon). (Some say time's up when the sun casts no shadow. It certainly would be more convenient for lay followers wishing to practice the one-meal-a-day practice that the time limit was set at 1:00 PM in that most restaurants are only open from 11:30.) In the U.S. that is called 'The Noon Hour' or 'Lunch Time.' At one time here, when farming still dominated the culture, it was the main meal of the day and was called 'dinner'. The evening meal was called 'supper' and usually consisted of soup and bread or perhaps some cold meat or cheese and the rule for good health was 'breakfast like a king, dine like a farmer, sup like a pauper'. In my grandmother's day and in the first part of my mother's day (@1850 - 1950), in the U.S. in the upper classes or in those who imitated the English upper classes with adaptation for the working husband, the first meal was often very heavy, with porridge with butter and milk and sugar, bacon and eggs and chops and toast, and coffee; there was Elevenzes, a tea-break at 11:00 with cheese, small sandwiches, pastries and tea; Lunch which was soup and a sandwich and fruit; Afternoon tea at 4:00PM, tea and crackers and cheese; and Dinner, a heavy meal of one or several courses of meat, potatoes, deserts, cheese, fruit, wines or beer, coffee and cigars; a cup of chocolate before bedtime; and a 'Midnight Snack' munching on whatever looked good in the 'ice-box' ... and wonder at indigestion, constipation, nightmares and bed-wetting not to mention the health problems resulting from obesity. Celebratory feasts (Thanksgiving, Christmas) were usually multi-course affairs held around 3:00 in the afternoon and were called 'Dinner'. Today [Friday, September 12, 2014 12:23 PM] breakfast, except on weekends, is a bagle or pastry and coffee, lunch and dinner are sometimes light and sometimes heavy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>In this digital conversion and formatting of the <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society translation of the <i>Aṅguttara Nikaya:</i> <i>The Book of the Fives,</i></b> all the translations and the <i>Pāḷi</i> have been completely unabridged, including the last 1000 suttas of the monster wheel sutta that concludes this book. (That's 1000 suttas that have not been seen fully rolled-out since the suttas were first set into writing! There is no way the beauty of this creation can be appreciated without seeing something like this. Nobody could possibly say that the <i>Suttas</i> are repetitious reading this. There are 1000 suttas they are all saying the same thing and not one of them is an exact duplicate of any of the others.) Every sutta is linked to its <i>Pāḷi</i> text and wherever possible to other translations. Both the translation and <i>Pāḷi</i> have been formatted keeping ease of reading and comprehension in mind. The <i>Pāḷi</i> text was read through once by me, comparing it to the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and adjusting the text in most cases to that of the PTS <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>
