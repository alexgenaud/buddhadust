						<p>Six ways of framing the idea of what is above all else.<br />
						This seems to me to be only a fragment of a sutta. Hare's footnotes give suttas where the idea is expanded, and see also <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p170">AN 5.170</a>.</p>

						<p>Six objects that are bases for the development of expanded recollection.<br />
						The key word is <i>anussati-ṭ-ṭhāna. Anussati</i> is not 'ever'-minding in that, as the Buddha explained concerning the idea of omniscience, one cannot be aware of (aka. remember) all things at all times, but only that one may be aware of whatever one wants to be aware of whenever one wants to be aware of it. 'Ever' means at all times. Further it is not the 'further-minding' that is being spoken of in this sutta but the things on which such further-minding stand <i>(ṭhāna).</i> <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'subjects' is an interesting translation, but then he translates <i>'anu-sati'</i> as 'recollection' and this is not just the recollection of certain subjects, but the subjects/objects to be used for (on which to stand) a deeper, further development of the memory.</p>

							<p class="in2">PTS: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.009.hare.pts.htm">Ever Minding,</a> III.204<br />

						<p class="in1"><b>&#35;<a id="p10" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/06_sixes/an06.010.pali.bd.htm">10: Mahānāma <i>Suttaṃ,</i></a> III.284</b></p>

						<p>Mahanama asks the Buddha about the things that should be made a big thing of by the Streamwinner. He is told to establish recollection of the Buddha, <i>Dhamma, Saṅgha,</i> his own ethical conduct, his generosity, and to reflect on the fact that it is by these means that the various Gods have become such as they are.<br />
						The keyword here is, as with the previous sutta, <i>anussati,</i> and both <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi (who has Mahanama often dwelling recollecting) and Hare (who has him living abundantly ever-minding) have missed the idea that Mahanama is asking about what further development of memory is to be done by the Streamwinner.<br />
						There is, in this sutta the quite rare use of the term <i>'dhamma-sota',</i> '<i>Dhamma</i>-ear', a term for the Streamwinner. Twenty times in all, six times, (most frequently) in AN 6, never in MN, DN, Vin.P., or Abhidhamma P. This is the ability to hear and understand <i>Dhamma</i> from the point of view of Pajapati after he has come to understand that he is not, after all, the creator of the world, that there is nothing that has come into existence that does not pass out of existence (and that consequently he is not responsible for that phenomena either), and that further, there is no thing there that can be called a self (of himself or of any other) onto whom to fix such responsibility. It is the understanding that beings individually subjectively experience the consequences of their deeds. This is also the ability to hear what is <i>Dhamma</i> whether found in a sutta or in ordinary conversation and to hear how any statement should be worded to make it conform to <i>Dhamma.</i> It's not: "A watched pot never boils;" it is: "A watched pot never boils over."</p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that in his day the various trades of the butcher did not pay off in living in luxury, or possessing wealth and social acceptance and that those engaged in such trades could look forward to rebirth in Hell.<br />
						The sutta is so worded that we can say that it is speaking of the results of those trades <i>in his day</i> which is good, because today we can see that there are at least some of those who engage in those trades on a grand scale who have in fact become wealthy, though I am not sure how well accepted they are in society.

						<p>The Buddha urges the <i>bhikkhus</i> to practice remembrance of death and a number of them come forward with the way they put this instruction into practice. The Buddha praises only those who practice such remembrance in the immediate present.<br />
						This sutta is difficult to get clearly into focus because the worst of the practices can easily be thought to be the best because it appears to be more comprehensive. But what is being pointed out here is the need to bear down on what is right in front of one, the very next thing, to really see the possibility that death can happen at any time. To be aware of the possibility that death can happen during the current day, half-day, or meal-time, and that therefore one should behave according to <i>Dhamma</i> is not much more focused on the problem than is the ordinary person's vague awareness that at some point in the future death is inevitable — it allows too much leeway for diversion.</p>

						<p>Six components of <i>samādhi.</i><br />
						An odd little sutta on the power of serenity or getting high. A person with these skills could break up Mount Everest but harder to do than that would be piercing the body of ignorance. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi and Hare have both translated <i>'samādhi'</i> as 'concentration.' For sure to work the magic power of breaking up a mountain or piercing ignorance the thing that is needed is a high degree of focus or concentration, but the art of working a deed of magic is culminated by the act of letting go, so concentration in and of itself is not sufficient. Similarly to pierce ignorance it is not sufficient to have focused or concentrated insight, that insight must be acted upon, and that act is also letting go. The result in both cases is serenity based on detachment. Concentration or focus is the fulcrum that is used to lever the mind to where letting go results in serenity. So say I.</p>

						<p>A group of <i>bhikkhus</i> has gathered around to discuss the appropriate time for visiting a <i>bhikkhu</i> who has become mind. Their suggestions all have to do with the convenience of the visit for the mind-become <i>bhikkhu.</i> Maha Kaccana however heard the teaching of the Buddha himself on the subject when a <i>bhikkhu</i> asks the Buddha about the same issue. He then relates the sutta [AN 6.27.] in which the Buddha describes the six occasions when such a visit is called for: at the time a <i>bhikkhu</i> is harassed by lust for sense pleasures, the anger and hate resulting from deviance from the way, sluggishness, anxiety from remorse, uncertainty, and not knowing what indicates what such as to terminate the corrupting influences.<br />
						Hare has translated <i>'mano-bhāvanīyhassa'</i> as 'a student of mind'; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has 'an esteemed bhikkhu'; P.E.D.: 'of right mind-culture, self-composed'. The word means: 'mind-become-one', or 'one who has made mind-become', and that is how I suggest it should be translated. This is perfectly consistent with the context, which suggests, if it does not absolutely require, a <i>bhikkhu</i> who has realized arahantship. What isn't in this word is anything indicating 'student' or 'right' or 'esteemed' though such a one could be all of these. Who should one go to for help? The most advanced person available. How does one differentiate? Approach, observe their behavior, listen to their instructions, remember, ponder, test, evaluate the results of your testing against the arising and disappearing of states in accordance with <i>Dhamma</i> (<i>Sutta</i> and <i>Vinaya</i>), and don't get stuck on individuals.</p>

						<p>Three pairs of ways of piling up deeds: through greed and not greed; hate and not hate; stupidity and wisdom. The Buddha describes the idea that lust, hate and stupidity tend to proliferate and end in unhappy births whereas their opposites tend to breed further good <i>kamma</i> which ends in a happy rebirth. This is a little, apparently simple, sutta which could easily be overlooked, but which has within it the kernel of one of the most important phenomena dealt with by Gotama's system: that is, that we tend to do what we remember having done.</p>

						<p>When hunger arises we recall that last time hunger arose we satisfied it with a big meal from the Greasy Spoon. We omit to remember, — <i>moha,</i> stupidity — the indigestion that followed later that night. The pleasant sensations of the memory urge the decision <i>lobha</i> to get such food once again, and once again we experience indigestion (and quickly suppress the memory after — <i>dosa,</i> hate).</p>

						<p>Had we exercised memory — <i>sati</i> — of the unpleasant result (or taken note of this sutta!), we could have dealt with the hunger with moderation and on later reflection enjoyed the fact that we had satisfied the needs of the body while at the same time we had freed ourself from the repetition of an unpleasantness. Pushed out, this is the same mechanism used in the process of finding rebirth.</p>

						There are some significant differences of opinion concerning the meaning of a couple of terms in this sutta and this results also in a very different understanding between translators as to its meaning in general. My take is that it is a very skillfully handled answer to Sivaka's question that not only answers his question, but teaches him a <i>Dhamma</i> lesson that illustrates the answer. Check it out for yourself. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi does not get his say, because his translation cannot be posted because of copyright restrictions, but his translation of key terms is cited in the footnotes to my translation.<br />
						I have here suggested a significant change in the usual translation of <i>'moha'</i> as 'delusion' (Hare's 'infatuation'). I am suggesting 'confusion'. In this sutta we can see that one is supposed to be able to recognize the presence or absence of <i>'moha'</i> within ourselves. People are able to recognize when they are confused, they are not able to recognize when they are deluded or infatuated as those ideas are defined by the fact of the self being deceived.</p>

						<p>A Brahman asks Gotama to explain the idea of a <i>Dhamma</i> which is to be seen for one's self.<br />
						A variation of the previous, likely adopted to the different temperaments of the wanderer and the Brahman. The lesson: explaining and giving an example of '<i>Dhamma</i> to be seen for one's self', is the same. The first term is changed from <i>'lobha'</i> (greed) to <i>'rāga'</i> (lust) and the last three terms are changed from <i>Dhammas</i> about <i>lobha, dosa</i> (hate) and <i>moha</i> (confusion), to bodily-, speech-, and mental-confusion. Hare has translated the last three as 'self-defilement in deed, word, and thought (so please note that it is acceptable here by one of the Oxford scholars to think of <i>'saṇ'</i> as 'self', which is equal to my 'own-' for <i>'saṅkhāra'</i>).</p>

						<p>A Brahman asks the Buddha if there is one thing which if properly cultivated can lead to welfare in both this life and the life hereafter. He is told that there is one thing that can do this: <i>a-p-pamāda,</i> non-carelessness.<br />
						A-[p]-pamāda = not-carelessness; <i>appa-māda:</i> little madness; <i>a-ppa-māda:</i> Don't Sputter Fat. Look it up.<br />

						<p>Dhammika, a short-tempered <i>bhikkhu</i> is making life so uncomfortable for other <i>bhikkhus</i> that they no longer wish to live with him.

						Again the understanding of the Buddha of the nature of persons is amazing. You can see that if this <i>bhikkhu</i> had simply been confronted with the fact that it was his own actions that brought about his banishment and the dislike of the other <i>bhikkhus,</i> he would never have been able to see or accept the fact. But hearing a story roughly paralleling his behavior and seeing in that that there was forgiveness at the end, his fear and defenses must have left him and he could see his fault without losing face. He goes on to become an Arahant.</p>

						<p>When Ānanda describes what a teacher of another sect calls 'the six classes of life', the Buddha responds with his own list.<br />
						It is very helpful to make conscious the difference in the two ways of thinking. Once you have it in front of you like this it seems obvious, but in fact the approach of the teacher of another sect is, even today, the more common, and almost always accepted without question. When the Buddha asks Ānanda if 'the whole world' approves of Purana Kassapa's list, what he is asking is: "Is this a teaching which is timeless, universally applicable, visible by the wise for themselves in this seen world?" Gotama's list conforms to this set of criteria. So what we get here, aside from the direct lesion, is a concise way of seeing how the <i>Dhamma</i> is constructed. I say make this difference conscious because the tendency throughout is for people to read the <i>Dhamma</i> and say: "This is all just common sense," forgetting that this common sense has not previously been at the forefront of one's mind or used to guide one's thinking and behavior, and certainly has not been gathered together anywhere else in such mass. Making yourself aware of this will help to keep conscious the unique opportunity you have in access to <i>Dhamma,</i> and that will help you keep at it.</p>

						<p>Citta Hatthi-sari-putta keeps interrupting the discourse of higher <i>Dhamma</i> by two elders and when told not to do so is defended by his friends who call him a wise <i>bhikkhu</i> capable of such a discussion. Mahā Kotthita gently explains to them that although this <i>bhikkhu</i> has attained certain very high states of <i>samādhi,</i> he is nevertheless still world-bound and will soon leave the order. This happens and the <i>bhikkhus</i> are impressed and tell the Buddha who then tells them that Citta will soon tire of the worldly life and again join the order. And this too happens and Citta becomes an arahant.<br />
						Here we have an example of the psychic power of 'mind-reading', but another interesting thing about this sutta is the way Mahā Kotthita approaches explaining the situation, that is in a highly indirect way. There is no mention of Citta, but only of 'some person' who may attain such and such a high state of mind, but because he is proud of this as a personal achievement and uses it to enhance his worldly situation this will result in the corruption of this achievement and his fall from the <i>saṅgha.</i> The fact that Citta does not recognize himself in the description and therefore takes no measures to correct himself tells the other <i>bhikkhus</i> why it is that he is not up to the discussion of higher <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

						The subtle point arises to the curious mind as to why Gotama here makes the statement that this <i>bhikkhu</i> must have been a beginner, or if an elder, a scatterbrain. Why should this be a conclusion he reached from this <i>bhikkhu</i> having made this statement? Because no <i>Deva</i> could have this sharp a vision. He is talking about being able to see the mind of an individual who has but a tip-end of a hair rising above the dung-heap which one could use to pull him out. Maybe.

						<p>Six things which are required to enter and abide in the First <i>Jhāna.</i><br />
						A different set of six. Hare has translated <i>'vitakka'</i> as 'brooding over', and <i>'saññā'</i> as 'conjuring up thoughts of'. <i>'Vicāra'</i> might be 'brooding over' but not <i>'vitakka'</i> which is in the place of our 'thinking' in huge numbers of contexts throughout the suttas. I object strongly to the translation of <i>'saññā'</i> as 'thought'. I have done a translation for comparison. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translation of the two terms is the same as mine; his usual understanding of <i>vitakka</i> is, however, the Commentarial idea of 'initial thought'. But what does it mean to 'give up perception of sense-pleasures, etc.?' There is thinking about a thing, and then there is allowing the idea of a thing to be understood as having the potential to provide sense-pleasures, etc. It's at an earlier stage than 'thinking about'. You see an individual of the opposite sex and going beyond the perception of form, you allow in the idea 'attractive', etc. That first 'allowing in' is perception and is a 'sign' of 'self'. "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."</p>

						<p>Unless one give up these six things one will be unable to realize states beyond those of mankind.<br />
						Looking at the items in the list, it seems reasonable to assume that this is referencing states beyond man including those of the <i>deva</i> realms; otherwise one would think that the wording would have been 'states beyond being'. I was going to say: "There are many out there that should take comfort in the fact that birth among men may still be had by those who are forgetful, lack self-possession, do not guard their sense experiences, lack moderation in eating, are deceitful and mealy-mouthed," but the fact is that this sutta does not say that. It only says that states beyond are not to be got by such a one. It could well be that rebirth among men was not to be had either. It probably depends on what else the person has done and the direction one is heading. Mankind is a mixed bag.</p>

						<p>Six things that result in great achievement in things.<br />
						Another sutta which must be understood as with the previous sutta, as multi-dimensional: having meaning for the general population hearing <i>'dhamma'</i> in one way, and having another meaning for the Buddhist, hearing <i>'Dhamma'</i> in another way. Hence the insertion of what is not in the <i>Pāḷi</i> by Hare of 'in right things' and of <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi of '[wholesome] qualities' <i>[dhamma],</i> distorts the sutta.<br />
						The key phrase to understand is: <i>mahantattaṃ vepullattaṃ pāpuṇāti dhammesu</i> [eminent] [bountiful-self-attainment] [fruition] in things. preeminent, bountiful, fruition of things for the self. Hare: "greatness and growth in right things"; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: "attain to greatness and vastness in [wholesome] qualities." Neither Hare nor <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi give <i>'atta'</i> a double meaning here as 'attainment' and as 'self', but I think it is justified. Remember these suttas were delivered orally. I believe Gotama had such command of the language that he did not use words that could be misunderstood and used words which could be heard in multiple ways constructing his meaning to accommodate those multiple meanings.</p>

						<p>Six things which are impossible for one who has attained high view.<br />
						Hare's translation of the last item: "one who has achieved right view cannot seek outside (the Order) for a gift-worthy" is misleading. In several places persons who have become Streamwinners are urged to continue to give gifts to other teachers as previously, and we are told that even scraping the dinner scraps into the sewer with the idea of feeding the creatures living there will result in good <i>kamma.</i> The idea is 'to honor by way of a gift' with emphasis on the 'honoring'. In <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.175.hare.pts.htm">AN 5.175</a> referenced in a footnote here, where the same expression is used, it is preceded by the qualifier: 'first seeks,' which allows even honoring other teachers though not placing them in the highest position. This might even be translated 'placing in preeminence by honoring'. There is no reason not to honor good, knowledgeable, wise people who are not on the path. It is just not wise, and is in fact dangerous relative to the goal, to place anyone above the Buddha.</p>

						A variation on the previous. The last item is similar and related to the last item in the previous sutta. Here it is said to be impossible to declare another teacher than the Buddha. A somewhat different matter than honoring but with a similar logic. Really what is being said is that the Four Truths is so compellingly satisfactory that one <i>would not</i> have any inclination to seek elsewhere for a teacher or doctrine.

						<p>Without giving up six things it is not possible to master the four pastures of the masters of mind.<br />
						This is not worded as 'the settings-up of mindfulness', but it is the four variations of each of the four: body, sense-experience, heart, and <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

						<p>There is complete lack of agreement with regard to numbering of the suttas within and between the versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> text and within and between the versions of the translations. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> has this numbered as 117 and 118; the PTS translation has it as 117 and 118-130 and omits three suttas. The BJT has the complete set of suttas (it has a completely different way of numbering suttas which I have not used anywhere). <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has this as two suttas 117 and 118 but omits the same 3 suttas as are omitted in the PTS text, and the <i>Pāḷi</i> he follows has the same numbering and omission. The omissions must be incorrect although the <i>Pāḷi</i> in the two cases is unclear; without the omitted suttas the usual and expected symmetry is missing. All this has resulted in the necessity of having duplicate numbers for some suttas. There should be no confusion when linking to suttas as there is no duplication in file names.<br />
						Essentially, the difference in the arrangement I have made here is that the suttas are grouped for ease of reading: they should all be read together and so are all included in one file. They are really one sutta and should have one number. It is highly unlikely that they were originally delivered as separate suttas. To get to the traditional number of 84,000 suttas however, they need to be numbered separately and include all the suttas.</p>

						<p>Hare has translated <i>'Dhamma'</i> here as 'thoughts,' which makes this, along with <i>'saññā'</i> and <i>'vitakka'</i> the third term he has translated as 'thought'. <i>'Dhammas'</i> in the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> suttas were originally thought to be 'objects of the mind,' (Walshe, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.010.horn.pts.htm">Horner,</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/mn/mn.010.ntbb.wp.htm">Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi</a>) and translated 'ideas' (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm#p14">Rhys Davids</a>) 'mental qualities' (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.22.than.ati.htm#p13">Bhk. Thanissaro</a>) (creating its own confusion with the previous category of <i>'citta'</i> translated 'mind' rather than 'heart' and meaning 'states of mind' or 'states of the heart'); where it should be thought of as <i>'The Dhamma',</i> meaning the essential teachings.</p>
