						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are inconstant, painful and not self and that seeing that brings freedom and recognizing that freedom as freedom rebirth is left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing has been done and there is no more being any sort of an it at any place of atness left for one.<br />
						Note that in terms of the senses, the sixth sense organ is 'mano', 'mind', and refers to the mind of an individual. 'Mano' in other places will refer to the mind of the Arahant, freed from the corrupting influences. When 'mind' refers to an individual it incompasses 'citta', 'heart' (the center of the emotions and mental states), and 'sati', 'mind' (meaning remembering, investigating and paying attention).</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that shapes, sounds, scents, savours, touches and things perceptible to the mind are inconstant, painful and not self and that seeing that brings freedom and recognizing that freedom as freedom rebirth is left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing has been done and there is no more being any sort of an it at any place of atness left for one.<br />
						Note that here the object of the mind sense is 'dhamma', 'things'. Bhk. Bodhi: 'mental phenomena'; Woodward: 'mind-states' (which would be better reserved for 'citta' — look at the distinction between citta and dhamma in the <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">the Maha Satipatthana Sutta</a>). 'Dhamma' (lower case 'd') can correctly be translated 'phenomena', but the addition of 'mental' to this term here is an explanation, not a translation. The objects of the mind sense are the sense-consciousnesses of the other five senses plus memories. In the same way that a computer program is built up from short bits of information — some directly input, others held in memory — which interact in such a way as to produce intelligible images, actions, conclusions and new memories, the images produced by the five lower senses are composed in ways directed by memory into composite pictures which are in turn composed into animated stories ... (whether they make good sense or not! ... garbage in - garbage out.)</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes what in his system accounts for absolutely everything in existence, calling it 'The All.'<br />
						Bhikkhu Thanissaro discusses in a footnote the question as to whether or not The All is intended to encompass Nibbana and whether, if Nibbana is not a dhamma, it can be considered The Self.<br />
						The All describes all that which has been own-made, <i>(sankhāra-ed),</i> that which has become (or which has becoming), a development of the conjunction of <i>nāma/rūpa</i> with consciousness, what we call 'all existing things'; an equivalent of the <i>khandhas.</i> Beyond that there is no <i>thing</i> <i>(dhamma)</i> which can be said to have existence. Nibbāna on the other hand, is not own-made, it is not a <i>thing,</i> the consciousness arising from and conscious of named/shapes. So the All includes the individualized <i>(sankhāra-ed)</i> mind and dhammas (things) and <i>the idea</i> of Nibbāna, but not Nibbāna. Because Nibbāna is not-become, does not have existence as understood in this way, it is therefore impossible to <i>point to</i> it.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches Dhamma for letting go of The All through thoroughly known higher knowledge.<br />
						Accomplish letting go by way of <i>abhiññā pariññā.</i> <i>Abhiññā</i> could be, as Bhk. Bodhi has it, 'direct knowledge', if one thinks of over-knowing as observing directly, but the term is most frequently associated with higher knowledge or at least superior knowledge close to magic powers. I think now that 'superior knowledge' would work best for all situations. Seeing the origin and passing away of things is superior to the common way of seeing things as stable in one's world. <i>Pariññā</i> is easier. Pari = pass around = all-round = thorough. One is to see the unstable nature of a thing by obsering that it comes to be and passes out of existence. That is your superior knowledge. Then one applies one's understanding that that which is unstable is painful because we do not like our pleasures to end and that which is painful is not worthy to be called the self or one's own. Seeing and understanding in this way one sees that a thing can give no lasting satisfaction and is therefore not worth pursuiing and one lets one's desire for it fade out. By the ending of desire, the thing is let go.</p>

						<p>A fire-and-brimstone preaching in which the Buddha declares the realms of the senses to be in flames. The Woodward translation is fully rolled out as is the Pali. My translation of this was very early (for me) and was going for drama. None of the other translations is complete. Delivered by someone who can be taken seriously it is enough to make one get busy. Originally delivered to 'the Three Kassapas' and their followers, it resulted in the entire group of one thousand becoming Arahant on the spot. A really good case for those who argue that Arahantship can be had without going through the four jhāanas. This was the third sutta delivered by Gotama.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches that the six sense realms are afflicted by aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.<br />
						A variation on the previous.<br />
						Both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi agree with the commentary in reading <i>aḍḍhabhūtam</i> for the <i>andhabhūtam</i> of the PTS text. Bhk. Bodhi translates 'weighed down'. I see no reason to object to <i>andhabhūtam:</i> which would be 'being blinded by'. The difference is orientation towards the being. <i>Aḍḍhabhūtam</i> suggests the affliction by these things <i>of the being</i>; <i>andhabhūtam</i> suggest the being blinded by these things <i>of the mind</i>. The latter would more closely adhere to the aims of the Dhamma.</p>

						<p>The Buddha presents the best method for the uprooting of thoughts about 'I am' and 'me.'<br />
						The important word to understand here and in the next two suttas is <i>maññati:</i> to think about, to form an opinion about, to adopt a point of view about. PED: to think, to be of opinion, to imagine, to deem. Woodward's 'conceit' introduces more complexity to the idea than is necessary, and does not well fit the usual way the word is used (e.g.: in the expression: 'What do you think about this?' or 'What is your opinion about this?'). 'Conceit' is frequently used in the PTS translations with the apparent intent 'to have an unwarranted notion that a certain thing is the self or one's own', but in most cases, as here, would would better be understood in the sense of 'having an opinion about', 'having a point of view about'. It is not observation that is the danger, it is forming opinions about what is observed that is the danger. Bhk. Bodhi appears to be using the word 'conceive' in the sense of create, to think up, to imagine the thing itself, which is I suggest a misunderstanding of the suttas. At the least it doesn't hold up across the set of applications that are to be avoided. "He does not think about; he does not think about the sensations that arise from; he does not think 'in that', 'of that'; he does not think 'I am that' 'this is my'. What is being spoken of here is the formation of points of view subsequent to observation where it is being pointed out that whatever opinion one forms is immediately wrong because things being in a constant state of becoming, change and cannot, because of that, be or belong to the self.

						<p>The Buddha presents a walk to walk to begin the uprooting of thoughts about 'I am' and 'me.'<br />
						A variation on the previous sutta. The curious thing here is the omition of the reference to The All. Substituted for that is the identical construction but using the <i>khandhas.</i> Some ideas that occur: The omition is a mistake. The omition is deliberate and points to the equivalence of the <i>khandhas</i> with The All. The titles may point to the significance. The first <i>'Sāruppa-Paṭipadā'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;SĀRUPPA: <i>'a shapely walk to walk'</i> PED: fit, suitable, proper. &gt; SA = with; RŪPA = shape, taken to mean 'equal to'; PAṬIPADĀ = path to walk; PED: means of reaching a goal or destination, path, way, means, method, mode of progress;  Woodward: a way that is proper; Bhk. Bodhi: 'a way that is appropriate'. The second: <i>'Sappāya-Paṭipadā'</i> <i>'a walk to walk to begin'</i> SAPPĀYA &gt; SAṄ = with, own, con; + (according to PED) PĀ = pass, but possibly also + PĀYA &gt; PĀ+Ā+YA = 'pass to whatever', 'to begin with'; PED: to start out; nstr. <i>pāyena</i> (adv.) for the most part, commonly, usually; PED: likely, beneficial, fit, suitable; Woodward: 'a way that is helpful'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'a way that is suitable'. Reading with me the possibility exists that what the Buddha is suggesting is a good way to begin the analysis is to conceptualize the all in terms of the <i>khandhas,</i> to fit the eye and sights, etc. into the scheme of the <i>khandhas</i>.</p>

						<p>Coversing suttas 33-42. The Buddha lists ten things that are aspects of the senses which when seen as they really are lead to dispassion and freedom from them leading to Arahantship.<br />
						Each of these things is <i>'-dhamma',</i> which both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translate 'subject to'. But this is torturing the word 'dhamma': Woodward's note: <i>"dhamma: having the quality of, the rule of; hence 'subject to,' 'liable to.'"</i> The simple: "Is a rebirth-thing ... an aging-thing, etc." would do just as well.<br />
						There is in the series both the term <i>'jarā'</i> and <i>'vaya'</i>. Woodward translates: 'age' and 'growing old'; Bhk.

						<p>Upasena has been bitten by a snake and wishes to die outdoors. He is taken out and before he dies is questioned by Sariputta as to why it is that he shows no change in his sense-faculties or countenance. Upasena declares that there is not in him any idea of I-making or mine-making with regard to the senses.<br />
						Woodward translates the last part of the dialogue "Now the venerable Upasena had  ... Therefore the venerable Upasena had..." giving the impression that this is a comment being made by the narrator, but it is a comment being made in response to Upasena by Sariputta so I have altered it slightly to make that point clearer. I have noted this fact in a footnote. Bhk. Bodhi in his translation puts this more clearly.<br />
						Note here the use of the terms <i>'ahaṃ-kāra-mamiṃ-kāra'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;'I-making-mine-making' (PED: <i>kāra</i> from "from <i>kr</i>") which I suggest provides precident for understanding <i>saŋ-khāra</i> as 'own-making.' PED spells <i>'Sankhāra'</i> but has "from <i>saŋ+kr</i>"</p>

						A bhikkhu is thrown into doubt when the Buddha tells the bhikkhus that those who do not see the appearance, the retirement, the satisfaction and misery, and the escape from the sixfold sphere of contact do not understand the Dhamma or follow the Discipline, for he perceives himself as not yet seeing these things as they really are. Then when the Buddha asks him if he sees the eye as 'me', 'mine' 'my self' the bhikkhu answers he does not. And the Buddha says that there you have it, that seeing the eye in this way is the method for seeiing the the appearance, the retirement, the satisfaction and misery, and the escape from the eye, etc.</p>

						<p>A bhikkhu asks if there might just one thing which if let go will result in blindness disappearing and vision arising. He is told that there is.<br />
						A different answer. The BJT Pali for this sutta repeats the opening refrain for each of the senses. This is not found in the PTS or CSCD texts and is out of place and has been eliminated  here.<br />
						Woodward has translated the word 'aññato' 'other', by 'changeable'. This is, with a certain amount of contortion, not incorrect, but misses the idea which is that the eye, etc. should be regarded as 'other'. That is other than the self or one's own. One can regard a thing as changeable but still regard it as one's own or one's self. Bhk. Bodhi has 'differently'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'something separate'. Something different or separate can also be regarded as one's own.</p>

						<p>Phagguna asks the Buddha if there are sense organs capable of perceiving the past Buddhas. He is told that there are not.<br />
						In other places the Buddha has taken advantage of similar questions to respond in the affirmative qualifying the answer by substituting the 'eye of dhamma' or 'the ear of dhamma' for the physical eye and ear. Here the form of Phagguna's question, by including all the senses and also by including all the past Buddhas, precludes this response.

						<p>The Buddha provides a general rule for the attainment of freedom from yokes in general through yoking one's self to abandoning the realms of the senses.<br />
						The sutta uses puns and depends on understanding the terms 'yoga' and 'pariyaya'. 'Yoga' in it's literal meanings as 'yoke' (as the yoke of a beast of burden to it's burden') and figuratively as 'devotion' or 'application' to a task. 'Pariyaya' means 'pass-round-whatsoever-whatsoever'. Most frequently in the sense of curiculum, or course. But it also means 'in general.' 'everything whatever'. The idea is along the lines of 'abandonging desire through desire to abandon desire;' 'yoked to abandonging the senses one abandons the yokes of the senses.' Here the meaning is that this curiculum will serve in any case of being yoked; that this is the most general way of stating the way to attain freedom.</p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that where the senses are seen as inconstant and painful the idea that the self is better or worse or equal to any other does not find any basis.<br />
						This is a variation on SN <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p105">4.35.105.</a> This is the advantage of these series of suttas which are similar in most respects but change in one respect: they hammer away at one aspect of the Dhamma from all sides. It is very easy to think that when one has penetrated through to one view of, say, the senses according to Dhamma, one has completely understood this Dhamma. With these suttas one can be sure. They scour off every contaminant. Here in order to understand how seeing that the senses are changeable and painful eliminates judgments of superiority and inferiority, one must first grasp the idea (which is not stated overtly, you have to work at it) that the senses, being changeable and painful cannot rightly be considered 'self'. Without 'self' there is no evaluation of 'self' and 'other'. Think of these suttas as a soft cloth that is polishing, polishing, polishing away everything that is obstructing your vision. Every one of them is worth a little elbow grease.</p>

						Because of the distinction made here between the fuel and the thing that makes the fuel fuel living, or between that which supports life and that which makes those supports support life, these are two (four) very good suttas to use to batter out your personal um...grasp/understanding/translation of <i>'upādāna'</i>. Grasping works. 'The eye is the thing grasped, the lust is the grasping." Bhk. Bodhi: 'The eye is a thing that can be clung to, the desire and lust for it is the clinging there.' But I don't think the idea is 'clinging' either in regard to the <i>khandhas</i> or in its place in the Paticca Samuppada. This word must stand for 'going after or supporting or fueling getting' or 'going towards, supporting, fueling making' not trying to keep, hang on to, what has already been got.</p>

						The Pali and the Woodward translation have been unabridged in accordance with the indications in the texts and in accordance with their own logic.

						<p class="in1">Bhikkhu Bodhi notes: "Feer wrongly entitles this sutta Agaytha, and runs it together with the next (beginning at IV 128,8)." The sutta numbering system of the BJT and CSCD Pali and the Bhk. Bodhi translation diverges from the PTS at this sutta which they have divided into two suttas. There are reasonable arguments for either side of the issue. I here follow the PTS numbering.</p>
						
						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that it is because of the instability of the objects of the senses that gods and men come to grief, but that the Arahant actually finds this instability his source of living at ease.<br />
						The sutta is especially interesting for the statement that it is the instability of sense objects that is the basis of ease for the Arahant. I don't believe this statement is made elsewhere in the suttas. How should this be understood? I would suggest that it is because the Arahant is free from the grief caused by this instability that perception of it is a reminder of what has been escaped. This is another way of stating that the consciousness of the Arahant is fed by perception of freedom; a statement that is made in several places throughout the suttas.

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus about old kamma, new kamma and the way to end kamma.<br />
						The important thing here is to grasp the idea of kamma as both the product of action and the action which brought about that product. This is not the same thing as our 'action' and 'result' as conceived of as discrete events in Time as reflected in our English construction 'subject, verb, object' — the one term stands for both. Understanding this will help clarify the understanding of <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> which is also the doing and the product in one term. Having grasped this way of seeing the world as flow of consciousness through a series of apparently (apparently only) static events consisting of action and consequence as a single unit, it will become clear why, as in this sutta, the Buddha felt it necessary to define what, precisely it is that is profitably considered the past and what the present, that is, that that part of the event which consists of the eye and objects should be thought of as the past; that part of it that is the action of doing should be considered to be the present. (The usual perception is that action occurs now and consequences follow later in time; but that perception is a consequence of being 'in-volved' in the world. Outside, apart from involvement, the perception is different than that. It is, in fact, perception of action as 'the present' and consequences as 'the future' that binds you to Time and identification with the 'actor'. It is the Buddha's description of this construction that is, in fact, the key to unlocking the door to this higher perception.) Then the lesson is completed by pointing out the way to stop the flow by following the Magga.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that at the point where the instability of personal sense experience is seen as unstable the destruction of the motivation to take enjoyment in the senses has been reached and with the destruction of the motivation to take enjoyment in the senses the lust for sense pleasure has been destroyed. With the destruction of taking enjoyment in lust the heart is freed.<br />
						The BJT Pali, for some reason, has mistakenly substituted 'Dukkha' for 'Anicca' throughout this sutta.<br />
						I have done a translation of this sutta because for a long time the translation of 'nandi' as 'delight' has bothered me in that the real idea is not the experience of delight or enjoyment, but the 'taking' or 'finding' of delight or enjoyment <i>in</i>, that is, really, the seeking out of, the indulgence in delight or enjoyment. Also in this translation is a new suggested translation for 'anicca' as 'unreliable.' Another translation that occurs to me now is 'flighty.' Another is 'fleeting.' Both of these, however, lack an easy opposite form constructed from the same root.</p>

						<p>The Buddha delivers a real old-time fire and brimstone sermon on the dangers associated with the senses.<br />
						I did my translation because Woodward conveys by his translation the idea that searing the eye, etc. with red-hot implements would be a good thing in general whereas the idea is that relative to the dangers of desire and lust wrapped up in sense experience it would be <i>better</i> to sear ... . Some zealidiot in times to come will be saying that we should all go around injuring our sense organs, or worse, that the Buddha said that we should all do so. It seems to me that the Buddha has changed his style here. It happens here and there. The syntax is unusual. Woodward speculates that this sutta may have been spoken with Devadatta in mind.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches that by following high view (samma ditthi) one naturally drifts towards and ends up in Nibbana in the same way that a log in the Ganghes, if it avoids all the obstacles, will drift towards and end up in the ocean.<br />
						One can see where a misunderstanding of this sutta could lead to the 'inaction' school of Buddhism. What this school is missing is that little bit about avoiding the obstacles. 'Not-doing' is 'intentional not-doing', not 'doing nothing.' The obstacles must be avoided by conscious, intentionally not engaging with them. When a lie would obtain some goal, consciously, intentionally not voicing that lie because doing otherwise would be in contradiction with high view.</p>

						<p>A bhikkhu questions a number of bhikkhus about the nature of perfection and receives different answers from each. Consulting the Buddha it is explained that there are many different approaches to Nibbana.<br />
						The simile of a tree seen at different seasons of the year is given for the idea of different views of the approach to Nibbana. The different approaches mentioned are: seeing the arising and passing away of the sense experiences; seeing the arising and passing away of the stockpiles of fuel; seeing the arising and passing away of the four great characteristics (earth, water, firelight and wind); and seeing that whatsoever comes into existence is something that must go out of existence. Note that the last one is usually found as the formula for Streamwinning. In other words, though that is the insight gained at the entrance to Streamwinning, it is also a path all the way to Nibbana. Then the Buddha gives another simile to illustrate the idea of different approaches while given another approach which is more fundamental, general and encompassing than the others, that is, following the Eightfold Path. He describes a king's fortress with six gates and a gatekeeper and the visitation by 'a swift pair of messengers' who deliver the truth to the king who sits at the crossroads. The terms of the simile are defined. Note that 'the swift pair of messengers' are the practices of 'calm' and 'insight'. Not just one or the other, but both.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus two similes: one for understanding the way mindfulness works to develop control over the inclination to indulge in sense pleasures, and the other, the famous simile of the Lute, to illustrate the emptiness of the pleasures of the senses.<br />
						This is an exquisite sutta to invision. Picture the field of ripe corn and then the cow and her delight in finding such a sumptuous meal only to end up being brow-beaten again and again until she learns to associate the field of corn with the beating, then imagine the somewhat feebleminded king, fascinated by the enchanting sounds of the lute and in a wonderfully thick-headed way searching for the sounds in the lute itself, taking it apart and not finding the sounds, in disgust shattering it to bits. The one simile folds right into the other and the combination blossoms out into a powerful lesson. This is our dilemma. It's like the smoker who knows smoking is bad for him and will lead him to a painful end but who must, to quit, engage in an enormous battle with his desire to smoke. Just understanding the problem of pain in existence and rebirth isn't enough. We need to break the habit and the way that is done is to so investigate the nature of sense pleasures that we see that they always, inevitably lead to a brow-beating. It's only at the point where we abandon all hope that there is a way to engage in pleasure of the senses without suffering the beating that we finaly reach the resigned detachment that is the freedom of Nibbana. "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!" This is the subtle trickery of Mara, that we read this as the sign over the entrance to hell, when it is the sign over the entrance to Nibbana.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches a simile for the control of the six senses by way of contrasting the result of tying each of six different animals with six different tastes when they are each tied to the others versus when they are each tied to a central stake.</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens sense experience to a shief of wheat being beaten by six farmers, then he likens the desire for rebirth to that same shief of wheat being beaten again by a seventh farmer. He then instructs the bhikkhus that any notion of things being the self or belonging to the self, any theories concerning such are vain, prideful assumptions with shaky unstable foundations.<br />
						Is it barley or corn? PED says 'corn', but in Britain 'corn' is wheat. Corn, 'maize', was not introduced into India until somewhere around 300 AD (so they say  — actually they say it was much later than that, (c. 1400), but there is good evidence that the Chinese were trading with the Mexicans as well as the Indians around 300 AD.). Bhk. Bodhi does not explain his choice of 'barley'. ? Barley corns?</p>
