						Note that in terms of the senses, the sixth sense organ is <i>'mano',</i> 'mind', and refers to the mind of an individual. <i>'Mano'</i> in other places will refer to the mind of the Arahant, freed from the corrupting influences. When 'mind' refers to an individual it encompasses <i>'citta',</i> 'heart' (the center of the emotions and mental states), and <i>'sati',</i> 'mind' (meaning remembering, investigating and paying attention).</p>

						Note that here the object of the mind sense is <i>'dhamma',</i> 'things'. Bhk. Bodhi: 'mental phenomena'; Woodward: 'mind-states' (which would be better reserved for <i>'citta'</i> — look at the distinction between <i>citta</i> and <i>dhamma</i> in the <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">the <i>Mahā Satipaṭṭhana Sutta</i></a>). <i>'Dhamma'</i> (lower case 'd') can correctly be translated 'phenomena', but the addition of 'mental' to this term here is an explanation, not a translation. The objects of the mind sense are the sense-consciousnesses of the other five senses plus memories. In the same way that a computer program is built up from short bits of information — some directly input, others held in memory — which interact in such a way as to produce intelligible images, actions, conclusions and new memories, the images produced by the five lower senses are composed in ways directed by memory into composite pictures which are in turn composed into animated stories ... (whether they make good sense or not! ... garbage in - garbage out.)</p>

						"The All" describes all that which has been own-made, <i>(saṅkhāraed),</i> that which has become (or which has becoming), a development of the conjunction of <i>nāma/rūpa</i> with consciousness, what we call 'all existing things'; an equivalent of the <i>khandhas.</i> Beyond that there is no <i>thing (dhamma)</i> which can be said to have existence. <i>Nibbāna</i> on the other hand, is not own-made, it is not a <i>thing,</i> in the sense of consciousness arising from and conscious of named/forms, but like anything else you can speak of using conventional speech, it is a thing. So the "All" includes the individualized <i>(saṅkhāra-ed)</i> mind and <i>dhammas</i> (things as objects) and <i>the idea</i> of <i>Nibbāna,</i> but not <i>Nibbāna</i> as an object. Because <i>Nibbāna</i> is not-become, does not have existence as understood in this way, it is therefore impossible to point to it.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches <i>Dhamma</i> for letting go of The All through thoroughly known higher knowledge.<br />
						Accomplish letting go by way of <i>abhiññā pariññā. Abhiññā</i> could be, as Bhk. Bodhi has it, 'direct knowledge', if one thinks of over-knowing as observing directly, but the term is most frequently associated with higher knowledge or at least superior knowledge close to magic powers. I think now that 'superior knowledge' would work best for all situations. Seeing the origin and passing away of things is superior to the common way of seeing things as stable in one's world. <i>Pariññā</i> is easier. <i>Pari</i> = pass around = all-round = thorough. One is to see the unstable nature of a thing by observing that it comes to be and passes out of existence. That is your superior knowledge. Then one applies one's understanding that that which is unstable is painful because we do not like our pleasures to end and that which is painful is not worthy to be called the self or one's own. Seeing and understanding in this way one sees that a thing can give no lasting satisfaction and is therefore not worth pursuing and one lets one's desire for it fade out. By the ending of desire, the thing is let go.</p>

						Both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi agree with the commentary in reading <i>aḍḍha-bhūtam</i> for the <i>andha-bhūtam</i> of the PTS text. Bhk. Bodhi translates 'weighed down'.

The difference is orientation towards the being. <i>Aḍḍha-bhūtam</i> suggests the affliction by these things of the being; <i>andha-bhūtam</i> suggest the being blinded by these things of the mind.

						<p>The Buddha presents the best method for the uprooting of thoughts about 'I am' and 'me.'<br />
						The important word to understand here and in the next two suttas is <i>maññati:</i> to think about, to form an opinion about, to adopt a point of view about. PED: to think, to be of opinion, to imagine, to deem. Woodward's 'conceit' introduces more complexity to the idea than is necessary, and does not well fit the usual way the word is used (e.g.: in the expression: 'What do you think about this?' or 'What is your opinion about this?' or 'What do you imagine?'). 'Conceit' is frequently used in the PTS translations with the apparent intent 'to have an unwarranted notion that a certain thing is the self or one's own', but in most cases, as here, would better be understood in the sense of 'having an opinion about', 'having a point of view about'. It is not observation that is the danger, it is forming opinions about what is observed that is the danger. Bhk. Bodhi appears to be using the word 'conceive' in the sense of create, to think up, to imagine the thing itself, which is I suggest a misunderstanding of the suttas. At the least it doesn't hold up across the set of applications that are to be avoided. "He does not think about; he does not think about the sensations that arise from; he does not think 'in that', 'of that'; he does not think 'I am that' 'this is my'. What is being spoken of here is the formation of points of view subsequent to observation where it is being pointed out that whatever opinion one forms is immediately wrong because things being in a constant state of becoming, change and cannot, because of that, be or belong to the self.

						<p>The Buddha presents a walk to walk to begin the uprooting of thoughts about 'I am' and 'me.'<br />
						A variation on the previous sutta. The curious thing here is the omission of the reference to The All. Substituted for that is the identical construction but using the <i>khandhas.</i> Some ideas that occur: The omission is a mistake. The omission is deliberate and points to the equivalence of the <i>khandhas</i> with The All. The titles may point to the significance. The first <i>'Sāruppa-Paṭipadā' sāruppa:</i> 'a proper walk to walk' PED: fit, suitable, proper. &gt; <i>sa</i> = with; <i>rūpa</i> = form, taken to mean 'equal to'; <i>paṭipadā</i> = path to walk; PED: means of reaching a goal or destination, path, way, means, method, mode of progress; Woodward: a way that is proper; Bhk. Bodhi: 'a way that is appropriate'. The second: <i>'Sappāya-Paṭipadā'</i> 'a walk to walk to begin' <i>sappāya &gt; saṇ</i> = with, own, con; + (according to PED) <i>pā</i> = pass, but possibly also <i>+ pāya &gt; pā + ā + ya</i> = 'pass to whatever', 'to begin with'; PED: to start out; nstr. <i>pāyena</i> (adv.) for the most part, commonly, usually; PED: likely, beneficial, fit, suitable; Woodward: 'a way that is helpful'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'a way that is suitable'. Reading with me the possibility exists that what the Buddha is suggesting is a good way to begin the analysis is to conceptualize the all in terms of the <i>khandhas,</i> to fit the eye and sights, etc. into the scheme of the <i>khandhas.</i></p>

						<p>Covering suttas 33-42. The Buddha lists ten things that are aspects of the senses which when seen as they really are lead to dispassion and freedom from them leading to Arahantship.<br />
						Each of these things is <i>'-dhamma',</i> which both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translate 'subject to'.

						<p>Upasena has been bitten by a snake and wishes to die outdoors.

						Woodward translates the last part of the dialogue "Now the venerable Upasena had  ... Therefore the venerable Upasena had..." giving the impression that this is a comment being made by the narrator, but it is a comment being made in response to Upasena by Sariputta so I have altered it slightly to make that point clearer.

						Note here the use of the terms <i>'ahaṃ-kāra-mamiṃ-kāra'</i> 'I-making-mine-making' (PED: <i>kāra</i> from "from <i>kr</i>") which I suggest provides precedent for understanding <i>saṇ-khāra</i> as 'own-making.' PED spells <i>'Saṅkhāra'</i> but has "from <i>saṇ+kr</i>"</p>

						Woodward has translated the word <i>'aññato'</i> 'other', by 'changeable'. This is, with a certain amount of contortion, not incorrect, but misses the idea which is that the eye, etc. should be regarded as 'other'. That is other than the self or one's own.

						<p>The Buddha provides a general rule for the attainment of freedom from yokes in general through yoking one's self to abandoning the realms of the senses.<br />
						The sutta uses puns and depends on understanding the terms <i>'yoga'</i> and <i>'pariyaya'. 'Yoga'</i> in its literal meanings as 'yoke' (as the yoke of a beast of burden to its burden') and figuratively as 'devotion' or 'application' to a task. <i>'Pariyaya'</i> means 'pass-round-whatsoever-whatsoever'. Most frequently in the sense of curriculum, or course. But it also means 'in general,' 'everything whatever'. The idea is along the lines of 'abandoning desire through desire to abandon desire;' 'yoked to abandonging the senses one abandons the yokes of the senses.' Here the meaning is that this curriculum will serve in any case of being yoked; that this is the most general way of stating the way to attain freedom.</p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that where the senses are seen as inconstant and painful the idea that the self is better or worse or equal to any other does not find any basis.<br />
						This is a variation on SN <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p105">4.35.105.</a> This is the advantage of these series of suttas which are similar in most respects but change in one respect: they hammer away at one aspect of the <i>Dhamma</i> from all sides. It is very easy to think that when one has penetrated through to one view of, say, the senses according to <i>Dhamma,</i> one has completely understood this <i>Dhamma.</i> With these suttas one can be sure. They scour off every contaminant. Here in order to understand how seeing that the senses are changeable and painful eliminates judgments of superiority and inferiority, one must first grasp the idea (which is not stated overtly, you have to work at it) that the senses, being changeable and painful cannot rightly be considered 'self'. Without 'self' there is no evaluation of 'self' and 'other'. Think of these suttas as a soft cloth that is polishing, polishing, polishing away everything that is obstructing your vision. Every one of them is worth a little elbow grease.</p>

(see: <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_18_rahulasamyutta.htm">SN: Rāhula Samyutta</a> iii, <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.091.wood.pts.htm">SN 3.22.91,</a> <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.092.wood.pts.htm">SN 3.22.92,</a> <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/01_ones/an01.188-210.wood.pts.htm#p209">AN 1.209</a> Personalities: <a href="../../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/rahula.htm">Rāhula</a>.) This teaching is one that has appeared several times in this Chapter, but has a twist at the end of each section that deals with the senses. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has copied and pasted the text from another sutta but has neglected to make the change in the end sections. In stead of ending with the question as to the permanence or impermanence of the sensations that arise consequent on sense-contact, it ends with a question as to the impermanence or permanence of sensation, perception, own-making and consciousness.</p>

There are reasonable arguments for either side of the issue. I here follow the PTS numbering.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> that it is because of the instability of the objects of the senses that gods and men come to grief, but that the Arahant actually finds this instability a source of living at ease.<br />
						The sutta is especially interesting for the statement that it is the instability of sense objects that is the basis of ease for the Arahant. I don't believe this statement is made elsewhere in the suttas. How should this be understood? I would suggest that it is because the Arahant is free from the grief caused by this instability that perception of it is a reminder of what has been escaped. This is another way of stating that the consciousness of the Arahant is fed by perception of freedom; a statement that is made in several places throughout the suttas. See: <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is <i>Nibbāna</i> Conditioned?</a> for more on this subject.</p>

						<p>I could have this incorrectly. It could be just a statement that these things ending, the Tathāgata lives happily. I have not seen this for myself.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> about old <i>kamma,</i> new <i>kamma</i> and the way to end <i>kamma.</i><br />
						The important thing here is to grasp the idea of <i>kamma</i> as both the product of action and the action which brought about that product. This is not the same thing as our 'action' and 'result' as conceived of as discrete events in Time as reflected in our English construction 'subject, verb, object' — the one term stands for both. Understanding this will help clarify the understanding of <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> which is also the doing and the product in one term. Having grasped this way of seeing the world as flow of consciousness through a series of apparently (apparently only) static events consisting of action and consequence as a single unit, it will become clear why, as in this sutta, the Buddha felt it necessary to define what, precisely it is that is profitably considered the past and what the present, that is, that that part of the event which consists of the eye and objects should be thought of as the past; that part of it that is the action of doing should be considered to be the present. (The usual perception is that action occurs now and consequences follow later in time; but that perception is a consequence of being 'in-volved' in the world. Outside, apart from involvement, the perception is different than that. It is, in fact, perception of action as 'the present' and consequences as 'the future' that binds you to Time and identification with the 'actor'. It is the Buddha's description of this construction that is, in fact, the key to unlocking the door to this higher perception.) Then the lesson is completed by pointing out the way to stop the flow by following the <i>Magga.</i></p>

						<p>The Buddha delivers a real old-time fire and brimstone sermon on the dangers associated with the senses.<br />
						I did my translation because Woodward conveys by his translation the idea that searing the eye, etc. with red-hot implements would be a good thing in general whereas the idea is that relative to the dangers of desire and lust wrapped up in sense experience it would be <i>better</i> to sear ... . Some zealidiot in times to come will be saying that we should all go around injuring our sense organs, or worse, that the Buddha said that we should all do so. It seems to me that the Buddha has changed his style here. It happens here and there. The syntax is unusual. Woodward speculates that this sutta may have been spoken with Devadatta in mind.</p>

						This sutta is identical in every way to the previous. This sometimes happens, but is very unusual. It is more likely that this was originally the start of a second sutta which would have somehow pointed to the external.<br />

						<p>The Buddha makes and explains similes for the four great characteristics, the five fuel stockpiles, desire, the six sense organs, the six sense objects, the corrupting influences, the eightfold path, <i>Nibbāna</i> and the Arahant.<br />
						A really rich and illuminating sutta. Includes the simile of the raft (the eight-fold Way). The similes are immensely helpful for both practitioner and translator. For the practitioner for gaining perspective on the concepts illustrated and for the translator who should always strive to make his translation seamlessly fit the simile.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches that by following high view <i>(sammā ditthi)</i> one naturally drifts towards and ends up in <i>Nibbāna</i> in the same way that a log in the Ganghes, if it avoids all the obstacles, will drift towards and end up in the ocean.<br />
						One can see where a misunderstanding of this sutta could lead to the 'inaction' school of Buddhism. What this school is missing is that little bit about avoiding the obstacles. 'Not-doing' is 'intentional not-doing', not 'doing nothing.' The obstacles must be avoided by consciously, intentionally not engaging with them. When a lie would obtain some goal, consciously, intentionally not voicing that lie because doing otherwise would be in contradiction with high view.</p>

						<p>Mahā Moggallāna delivers a discourse on what constitutes a leaky <i>bhikkhu.</i> If a <i>bhikkhu</i> dwells attached to the pleasures of the senses, averse to the pains of the senses then he is conquered by the senses and subject to old age, sickness and death and is a leaky <i>bhikkhu.</i> If he is not attached to the pleasures of the senses, averse to the pains of the senses then he is conqueror of the senses and not subject to old age, sickness and death and is not a leaky <i>bhikkhu.</i> One of a very few places where we get to hear the voice of Mahā Moggallāna.<br />

						<p>The Buddha explains what it means to know and see the appearing and disappearing of all states of pain and how, so seeing one is freed from sense experience.<br />
						The distinctive lesson here is the emphatic statement that by knowing and seeing the appearing and disappearing of body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness one is knowing and seeing <i>all</i> states of pain. The sutta includes helpful similes and methods for practicing to attain such knowing and seeing.</p>

						<p>A <i>bhikkhu</i> questions a number of <i>bhikkhus</i> about the nature of perfection and receives different answers from each. Consulting the Buddha it is explained that there are many different approaches to <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
						The simile of a tree seen at different seasons of the year is given for the idea of different views of the approach to <i>Nibbāna.</i> The different approaches mentioned are: seeing the arising and passing away of the sense experiences; seeing the arising and passing away of the stockpiles of fuel; seeing the arising and passing away of the four great characteristics (earth, water, firelight and wind); and seeing that whatsoever comes into existence is something that must go out of existence. Note that the last one is usually found as the formula for Streamwinning. In other words, though that is the insight gained at the entrance to Streamwinning, it is also a path all the way to <i>Nibbāna.</i> Then the Buddha gives another simile to illustrate the idea of different approaches while given another approach which is more fundamental, general and encompassing than the others, that is, following the Eightfold Path. He describes a king's fortress with six gates and a gatekeeper and the visitation by 'a swift pair of messengers' who deliver the truth to the king who sits at the crossroads. The terms of the simile are defined. Note that 'the swift pair of messengers' are the practices of 'calm' and 'insight'. Not just one or the other, but both.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> two similes: one for understanding the way mindfulness works to develop control over the inclination to indulge in sense pleasures, and the other, the famous simile of the lute, to illustrate the emptiness of the pleasures of the senses.<br />
						This is an exquisite sutta to invision. Picture the field of ripe corn and then the cow and her delight in finding such a sumptuous meal only to end up being brow-beaten again and again until she learns to associate the field of corn with the beating, then imagine the somewhat feebleminded king, fascinated by the enchanting sounds of the lute and in a wonderfully thick-headed way searching for the sounds in the lute itself, taking it apart and not finding the sounds, in disgust shattering it to bits. The one simile folds right into the other and the combination blossoms out into a powerful lesson. This is our dilemma. It's like the smoker who knows smoking is bad for him and will lead him to a painful end but who must, to quit, engage in an enormous battle with his desire to smoke. Just understanding the problem of pain in existence and rebirth isn't enough. We need to break the habit and the way that is done is to so investigate the nature of sense pleasures that we see that they always, inevitably lead to a brow-beating. It's only at the point where we abandon all hope that there is a way to engage in pleasure of the senses without suffering the beating that we finally reach the resigned detachment that is the freedom of <i>Nibbāna</i>. "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!" This is the subtle trickery of Māra, that we read this as the sign over the entrance to hell, when it is the sign over the entrance to <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

						<p>The Buddha likens sense experience to a sheaf of wheat being beaten by six farmers, then he likens the desire for rebirth to that same sheaf of wheat being beaten again by a seventh farmer. He then instructs the <i>bhikkhus</i> that any notion of things being the self or belonging to the self, any theories concerning such are vain, prideful assumptions with shaky unstable foundations.<br />
						Is it barley or corn? PED says 'corn', but in Britain 'corn' is wheat. Corn, 'maize', was not introduced into India until somewhere around 300 AD (so they say  — actually they say it was much later than that, (c. 1400), but there is good evidence that the Chinese were trading with the Mexicans as well as the Indians around 300 AD.). Bhk. Bodhi does not explain his choice of 'barley'. ? Barley corns?</p>
