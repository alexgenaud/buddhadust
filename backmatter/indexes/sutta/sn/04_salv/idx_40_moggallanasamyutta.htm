						Most of the remarks regarding the previous sutta apply also to this one. With regard specifically to the second <i>jhāna</i> is my objection to translating the word <i>'samādhi'</i> as concentration. <i>Samādhi</i> is not just concentration, it is the serene state of one who has developed the whole spectrum of attainments from giving to ethical conduct to self-control to development of mind and the factors as described within the <i>jhānas,</i> and characterized by the individual having no ambitions, having no sign of lust, hate or ignorance, and being empty of lust, hate and ignorance. In the first and second <i>jhāna samādhi</i> is only just beginning it's higher development.</p>

						Woodward has for <i>Upekkhā-sati-pārisuddhiɱ.</i> <i>"a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity,"</i> which either ignores <i>'sati'</i> or (unlikely) translates it as 'balance.' I argue that <i>'upekkhā',</i> usually translated 'equanimity' should be translated 'detachment'. PED: "looking on", hedonic neutrality or indifference, zero point between joy and sorrow ... disinterestedness, neutral feeling, equanimity. Sometimes equivalent to <i>adukkham-asukha-vedanā</i> "feeling which is neither pain nor pleasure". (Which is the <i>'vedanā'</i> of the Arahant, or the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna.</i> — <i>'Upekkhā'</i> is also the equivalent of <i>'vimutti',</i> 'freedom,' which is also the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna.</i>) I except "equanimity". Equanimity is a state of impassivity which is a precurser to detachment (see the Sixth <a href="../../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">Sambojjhanga</a>) and is a state which is still involved with the world. The goal is a state that is at least temporarily not involved with the world.</p>

						<p>Moggallāna The Great, one of the two most powerful of the Buddha's followers, and the one whose strong point was magic power, describes his first attempts to master the the level of meditation practice called The Realm of Naught Whose-Whatever.<br />
						My translation of this is just a stab in the dark. The current translation based on the idea of nothingness seems to miss the point: the idea is not that there is nothing, but that there is nothing there that can be had, or owned; or alternatively that there is nothing there that causes the obstructions lust, hate and delusion or that there is nothing there <i>of</i> the obstructions lust, hate and delusion. The one thing that is reasonably certain is that the meaning is not 'nothingness'. Lately I have considered the idea that this is a realm based on the perception that there is nothing real there.</p>

						<p>Moggallāna The Great, one of the two most powerful of the Buddha's followers, and the one whose strong point was magic power, describes his first attempts to master the the level of meditation practice called Signless Serenity of Heart.<br />
						Still another term translated 'conditioned'. So when you see this word you need to look up the Pali. If it is <i>'Nidāna'</i> it means 'tied to' 'bound up with'; if it is <i>'paṭicca'</i> it means 'depending on', if it is <i>'sankhara'</i> it means 'own-made or constructed' if it is <i>'nimitta'</i> it means 'signs, signatures, marks'. 'The Unconditioned' is also the mistranslation used to describe <i>Nibbāna,</i> and the Signless is not yet <i>Nibbāna.</i> Bhk. Bodhi: 'signless concentration of mind'. What signs does one not dwell on? Pleasant or unpleasant features of things. The idea is not non-perception of objects, it is the state arrived at when not dwelling on the pleasant or unpleasant features of objects to the extent that lust, hate, or delusion arises. Lust, Hate and Delusion leave signs so the state arrived at is one in which no signs of these things are left. And that doesn't mean one covers one's tracks well, it means one leaves no track because those things do not exist in one there!</p>

						<p class="in1"><b><a id="p10" href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.40.010.pali.bd.htm">10. Sakka Suttaɱ,</a> IV.269</b></p>
						
						<p>Moggallāna visits the Tavatimsa Realm and delivers an hypnotic spell in praise of the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha to Sakka and five hundred other devas. Sakka replies repeating the spell back to Moggallāna. Sakka then returns four more times with incresing numbers of devas. The same events are repeated with a variation on the spell.<br />
						As far as I am concerned there is no longer any doubt that these long repetititititive suttas at the conclusion of chapters are genuine hypnotic spells constructed to be delivered in full and which result in transporting the mind of the listener into higher dimensions. An invaluable glympse into old-time magic spells and dhamma teaching techniques. The translation is fully rolled out, the Pali I have left abridged but formatted for greater clarity.</p>

						<p>Moggallāna visits the Tavatiɱsa Realm and delivers an hypnotic spell in praise of the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha to Candano, Suyāmo, Santusito, Sunimmito, and Vasavatti.<br />
						This should probably be 5 different Suttas, each identical to SN 4.40.10 with only the name of the deva changed. This is represented in the Pali only by the names of the devas and an indication that the previous sutta should be repeated with changes. As this is a separate file, I have reconstructed the first set with the changed name. With only my patchwork knowledge of Pali I may not have got the proper endings for the names in all cases in the Pali.</p>
