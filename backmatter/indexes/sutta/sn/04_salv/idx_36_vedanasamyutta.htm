						<p>Both the common person and the Arahant experience painful sensations, pleasant sensations and sensations that are not painful but not pleasant.

						<p>The Buddha visits the sick ward and delivers a sermon on being prepared for death through recollectedness and self-awareness.<br />
						<i>"Sata</i> and <i>sampajāna</i>" Woodward: "collected and composed"; Bhikkhu Bodhi and Nayanaponika Thera: "mindful and clearly comprehending"; Bhikkhu Thanissaro: "mindful and alert." SATA p.p. of &gt; <i>'Sarati':</i> to remember; SAMPAJĀNA: saŋ+pajāna: own or self + know, understand.<br />
						It is interesting to note the difference in customs and culture between our own and the Buddha's time as can be seen in this sutta. If someone today were to walk into a ward for the terminally ill and deliver a sermon on being prepared to die he would be thought to be in very poor taste ... and as a result of respecting this convention those who were in fact facing immanent death would not hear what they needed to hear. For whose sake, for whose comfort in blindness, then, is our custom of never mentioning death to the dying? Of course our situation is so twisted up today [Sunday, May 31, 2015 8:25 AM] that the dying themselves would become offended at this 'behavior in bad taste'.</p>

						<p>The Buddha visits the sick ward and delivers a sermon on being prepared for death through recollectedness and self-awareness.<br />
						Identical with the previous sutta with 'contact' (phassa) being substituted for 'body'. Nyanaponika Thera has footnoted that <i>'phassa'</i> (which he translates as 'sense-impression') is 'mental factor and does not signify physical impingement'. I don't know where he gets this idea. First the literal translation of <i>'phassa'</i> is 'touch'. It is understood to be the contact of a sense object with a sense organ <i>together with consciousness</i>. And here it is, if contrasted with the previous sutta, a synonym for 'body'. Surely this is physical or at most physical/mental impingement. The reverse would actually imply the creation of the sense organ and object by its own sense-consciousness ... <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's error.</a> "Own-eye-impact, beggars, comes to be as a result of eye data, it is not that eye data comes to be as a result of own-eye-impact," <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.14.003.olds.bd.htm">SN 2.14.3</a> (and <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_14_dhatusamyutta.htm#p1">the entire vagga</a><br />
						If what Nyanaponika Thera is saying is that <i>'phassa'</i> is to be defined as 'the <i>experience</i> of contact,' (which would be a mental factor) this does not comport with this very sutta which is saying that the experience, <i>'vedana',</i> arises as a <i>consequence</i> of the contact.<br />
						My version of BJT has simply copied the previous sutta without making the appropriate changes. In fact my version of the BJT Pali has been very poorly edited throughout this volume. Perhaps this has been corrected in later editions, but be careful!</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens the various sense experiences to the various sorts of guests that inhabit a guest house.<br />
						This sutta is one of the few places where the <i>vedanas</i> are described in the two modes found in the <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p11">Satipatthana Sutta.</a> It is very important to understand how this works. The sense experience produced by contact with an identical object or situation can be experienced in different, opposite ways depending on one's mental state, perspective or orientation. From the point of view of one letting go of the world, what would have produced a pleasant sense experience for one downbound to the world will be experienced as unpleasant (both in it's nature as temptation, and as transient and leading inevitably to pain); what would have produced an unplesant sense experience will be experienced as plesant (because experienced as no longer pertaining to the self) and what would have been experienced as a neutral sense experience inclining the downbound to seek pleasant sense experience will be experienced by the renunciate as a taste of Nibbāna. For the one the experience is impersonal and mental and does not equate to our idea of 'sensation' but is more like 'idea'; for the other it is a subjective experience that is a mixture of bodily and mental sensations. Because of the need for the one word to satisfy both uses I suggest that <i>vedana</i> be translated not as 'sensation' but as 'sense experience' or just 'experience' depending on whether the case is of the one downbound to the world or is beyond sense-experience. 'Feeling' which is the most frequent translation, but which does not relate to the literal meaning of <i>'vedana'</i> ('the given experience'), does not well serve both needs.</p>

						<p>The Buddha explains that he has taught an understanding of sense experience in multiple ways each of which is complimentary, not contradictory with the others. He then teaches his understanding of pleasure by describing a progression from gross sensual pleasures to the sublime pleasure of the ending of perception and sense experience.<br />
						A very important sutta for the understanding of the meaning of <i>'vedana'</i> and also for the Buddhist understanding of pleasure or happiness.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes various sources of pain in the world that are not directly attributable to kamma.<br />
						Note carefully that this is a precise response to the precise wording of a statement being made, that is that <i>all</i> sense experiences is driven <i>(hetu)</i> by past deeds. The meaning is that while all sense experiences can be said to result from the past deeds that brought about the current life, there are certain experiences in life that are driven by impersonal, non-karmic forces.</p>
