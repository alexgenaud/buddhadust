						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that destruction of lust, anger and blindness is the not own-made (asankhata) and then give them fourty-five paths to the not-ownmade.<br />
						The BJT Pali numbers each of the sub-sections in this sutta as a separate sutta.<br />
						This sutta elaborates somewhat on the previous eleven suttas. Here will be found one case where calm (samatha) and insight (vipasana) are each said to be paths to the goal in and of themselves. However digging into the details of each will show that each contains the other. Vipasana practice uses the Four stations of the mind which involves the Magga which contains Samma-samadhi; and Samadhi practice encompasses the whole practice from generosity on up. Similar encompassings can be worked out for the other fourty-three cases. This system is holographic. Each basic element contains the whole.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus the end point of the system and then gives them 46 paths to that endpoint.<br />
						The numbering of this sutta and the sub-sections within it are confused between versions. Woodward has numbered this as Ī12(2) but there seems no justification for that. I have changed the number and the number of the suttas that follow in this Chapter and have noted such in the Index. Otherwise he has worked out the scheme of subheadings in the most logical way. Bhk. Bodhi has it that the sutta is a re-working, with the one change, of suttas 1-12. Woodward has it that it is this reworking but with suttas 1 <i>and</i> 12. Sutta 1 is the only sutta of the first 11 which is not duplicated in 12. Also it is a good umbrella sutta for the rest. This makes the scheme look like: I and 2-11; 12 = 2-11 (with components each taking one sub-section, i.e., section 2 which is <i>samatha</i> and <i>vipassana</i> in Ī2 separates <i>samatha</i> and <i>vipassana</i> into two sub-sections in Ī12; 13 (and the following) then take the form: I+12. While there is repetition in the suttas duplication is rare. I have followed Woodward's scheme in rendering the unabridgment of this sutta in his translation and in the Pali. I have left Bhk. Bodhi's abridgment as it is per the copyright restrictions.</p>

						There is some sort of problem here. The PTS, BJT and CSCD all have <i>'Apalokita'.</i> PTS defines this as "asking permission." Woodward objects and uses <i>apalokina</i> aparently following the Commentary. Bhk. Bodhi follows either Woodward or the Commentary without making a comment. Childers has a secondary definition "the unseen", which has the advantage of being the word as given and making sense. I would think this was 'beyond the worldly' apa = up past + lokita = this world but that is not in the dictionaries.</p>
