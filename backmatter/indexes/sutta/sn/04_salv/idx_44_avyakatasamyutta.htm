						<p>The Venerable Sariputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika that the reason the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is because any such assertion would limit such a one to existence relative to form, sense experience, perception, own-making and consciousness and that such a one cannot be described by such limited ideas.<br />
						As noted by Woodward the Venerable Kotthita is not asking these questions because he needs to know the answers. He is likely asking these questions of Sariputta in front of a gathering of students so that they would hear the answers to properly put questions.</p>

						<p>The Venerable Sariputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika that the reason the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is because the very question does not arise to one who sees form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness as they really are.</p>

						<p>The Venerable Sariputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika that the reason the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is because to one who has abandoned passion, desire, affection, thirst, craving for body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness such questions do not even arise.</p>

						<p>The Venerable Sariputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika other reasons that the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is that these questions do not arise for one who has abandoned delight in body, sense-experience, own-making and consciousness; or for one who has abandoned delight in becoming; or for one who has abandoned delight in thirst. He then aserts that there is no reason more encompassing for not making such asertions than that such do not occur for one who has abandoned thirst.<br />
						All texts and translations make the error of switching Sariputta for Kotthita as the questioner at the end of this sutta. My BJT Pali is particullarly messed up in this Chapter.</p>

						<p>The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks Maha Moggallāna a series of questions about existence and non-existence and is told in all cases that these are not questions on which the Buddha has made a declarative statement. When asked why this is so, Maha Moggallāna explains that it is only because of holding views about the self with regard to the senses that these questions arise and that not holding such views the questions do not arise. Vaccha then goes to the Buddha and puts the same questions and receives the same answers.<br />
						This is one of the places which I have here and there mentioned where the bhikkhus themselves, at the time, remark on the fact that both disciples and the Buddha use the same wording and phrasing when responding to the same questions. I suggest this is because the most precise wording and phrasing with regard to questions and answers has been worked out and so is not a matter of remembering what the Buddha Said, but of responding in accordance with the most precise understanding. I further suggest that we can and should find such precise wording in our English translations and that that is the way the doctrine will be most profitably understood.</p>

						<p>The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks Gotama about the difference in the way he announces the destinations after death of his disciples versus those of other teachers. He is told that the difference is that the Buddha determines rebirths according to the individual's remaining fuel.<br />
						Fuel here is <i>'upādāna'.</i> Since 'fuel for a fire' is given as a simile, it is certain that we have here a most suitable translation for this term.</p>
