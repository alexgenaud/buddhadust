						<p>Many of the outstanding leaders under Gotama are walking back and forth followed by great numbers of disciples and the Buddha points out to the bhikkhus sitting around him that each is following a leader whos disposition is similar to their own. He  then states that in the past, the future and the present beings gather together in groups based on similarities in their beliefs. This is an expansion of the previous sutta. There are links to biographical information on each of the leaders mentioned.</p>

						<p>The Buddha Points out that in the past, the future and the present people gather together in groups bsed on similarities in their beliefs: those with no faith in the Dhamma with those of no faith, those with faith in the Dhamma with those of faith. A variation of the previous suttas. The PTS Pali inserts the description of those with faith into the section on those without faith. It could be that this represents another way the sutta was to have been organized, but it is not developed that way in the rest. I have followed the BJT and CSCD. Mrs. Rhys Davids abridges in such a way as to obscure the way the sutta is organized. Both the Pali and Mrs. Rhys Davids translation have been properly unabridged here.</p>

						<p>Suttas 18-22 develop the theme begun in the previous suttas that in the past, future and the present people gather together in groups based on similarities in their characteristics in the form of a 'wheel' according to the following scheme (using Mrs. Rhys Davids Vocabulary):</p>

						<p><b>18.:</b> Unbelievers, unconscientious, unwise;<br />
						believers, conscientious, wise:<br />
						Unbelievers, indiscrete, unwise;<br />
						believers, discrete, wise;<br />
						Unbelievers, uneducated, unwise;<br />
						believers, educated, wise;<br />
						Unbelievers, lazy, unwise;<br />
						believers, energetic, wise;<br />
						Unbelievers, muddleminded, unwise;<br />
						believers, levelheaded, wise.</p>

						<p><b>19.:</b> Unconscientiousness, indiscrete, unwise;<br />
						conscientiousness, discrete, wise;<br />
						Unconscientiousness, uneducated, unwise;<br />
						conscientiousness, educated, wise;<br />
						Unconscientiousness, lazy, unwise;<br />

						<p><b>20.:</b> Indiscreet, uneducated, unwise;<br />
						Discreet, educated, wise;<br />
						Indiscreet, lazy, unwise;<br />
						Discrete, energetic, wise;<br />
						Indiscrete, muddleminded, unwise;<br />
						Discreet, levelheaded, wise.<br />
						<b>21.:</b> Uneducated, lazy, unwise;<br />
						Educated, energetic, wise;<br />
						Uneducated, muddleminded, unwise;<br />
						Educated, levelheaded, wise;<br />
						<b>22.:</b> Lazy, muddleminded, unwise;<br />
						Energetic, levelheaded, wise.</p>

						<p>All this in the PTS translation is abridged down into one paragraph giving the titles and a description of the formula from which it would not be possible using it alone to figure out the actual scheme.</p>

						<p>I don't know why people are not jumping up and down with delight at seeing these. Except, of course, that we are cool, and do not display our emotions in such a crude way. This is like looking back 2500 years and seeing the way people's minds were working and what <i>they</i> were taking delight in. There just is not anything even approaching this intimate view of another time in any other literature in the world. Simply marvelous!</p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that people gather together in groups based on similarities in their characteristics. He identifies two groups with opposing characteristics that gather together. It is interesting to note that although this sutta is, in the Pali, named <i>'Dasaŋgika'</i> <i>'ten-aŋgika'</i> and the previous sutta is <i>'Aṭṭhaŋgika'</i> <i>'eight-aŋgika'</i> (no 'magga') Mrs. Rhys Davids translates 'eightfold' and 'ten factors' while Bhk. Bodhi translates 'eightfold path' and 'ten factors'. I believe that in the same way we do not go around putting titles on the various conversations we have with people, that the suttas and such various lists as we find throughout the suttas were only given names when repeated reference to them made naming them a convenience. So it is a reasonable conclusion to think that what we have here is early relative to those places where the Eight-Dimensional Way or the Ariya Eight Dimensional Way and the <i>(Ā)Sikkhāpada</i> are referred to by those names. Again to my mind this would tend to suggest that these 'tedious repetitions' were early, not later 'monkish' additions. This theory is confounded by the fact that in <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.011.pali.bd.htm#p1">the first sutta</a> (also found in the <i>Saɱyutta Nikāya</i>) the <i>'Aṭṭhaŋgika'</i> is called <i>ariyo aṭṭhaŋgiko maggo.</i> Could it possibly be that the first sutta was subject to 'monkish' tampering? To attain the Eye of Dhamma it is necessary only to have the first three of the Four Truths (to hear that 'this' is pain, that this pain has it's origin in thirst, and that it can be brought to an end by ending thirst), but the fourth truth, being the Way to do it, is not explained in detail sufficient to make it comprehensible. Even allowing that <i>aŋgikas</i> 2-8 could be guessed at thinking the intent was 'the highest form in which these things are practiced) the first <i>aŋgika,</i> 'ditthi' or 'view,' was unique to Gotama and would not have been known in any way prior to this utterance. But the fact is that the Magga is, in it's details, carefully and uniquely contstructed in units of intentional not-doing. No other contemporary set of instructions for attaining the goal of solving the problem of rebirth and pain in existence was constructed in this way. The Magga without knowledge of it's details is, if not useless in attaining the goal, almost as difficult a task as becoming self-awakened without a teacher. It leaves up to the individual to determine what, exactly is <i>'sammā'</i> 'consummate' this and that. And while that will in fact be helpful, it will not likely result in the intentional not-doing of all behavior intended to cause personal existence that is required for the goal. So this problem reaches another <i>aŋgika</i> dimension: those places where it is given without the details look to be places where the details were assumed to be known or where it was assumed that they would be explained by the leaders of groups. Those places in the suttas where the details are given  are relatively infrequent. All sorts of questions arise when thinking about this. Where were the details first introduced? Was the Magga itself a later compilation from the various <i>aŋgikas</i> as developed individually or in groups? Why is there so little emphasis on the details of the Magga as a unit? Why the distinction between the eight-dimensioned and the ten-dimensioned? And why the change from 'fold' to 'factor'? What was the impulse that lead Bhk. Bodhi to insert 'Path' where it was not in the Pali? But as to that, just remember: 'a rose by any other name will smell as sweet.' This is all just a matter of curiosity.</p>

						<p>The Buddha introduces the four basic bits of information we receive about things in the world: that things are Earth-like, Water-like, Firelight-like and Wind-like. PED gives one of the ideas in back of this term as <i>dhātū,</i> being the equivalent of 'dom' as in surf-dom. A footnote in the next sutta references the commentary in explaining the meaning as 'solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion.' Properties, characteristics, bits of information, not 'elements.'</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes how if there were no satisfaction to be got from the properties of solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion, there would be no lust for them, how if there were no pain associated with them there would be no dissatisfaction with them, how if there were no way to escape from them there would be no escaping from them, but since there is, there is, and that it is only insofar as one has understood these things as they are that there is any living of the religious life and attaining to freedom. An apparently simple idea but one which is essential to understand to keep from swinging from the lust for the world that makes one blind to the problems of life to a hate for the world that makes one blind to the reasons one gets attached and bound up.</p>

						<p>The Buddha declares that he who takes delight in the earthly, the watery, the fiery, and the windy is not free from pain, but he who is free from such delight is free from pain. For my translation of this sutta I have taken advantage of the PED mention of the fact that the term <i>'dhātū'</i> acts almost as the suffix 'dom' which I have extended to 'y' = 'iness', etc. and which it looks to me now to be for at least some cases where this term is used the best of all solutions.
