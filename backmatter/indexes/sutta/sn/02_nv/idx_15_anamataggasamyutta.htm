						<p>The Buddha provides a simile to describe the number of aeons that there have been.<br />
						The simile is not intended to suggest the number of aeons that have passed since the beginning of time. It is intended to show that the scope is beyond reckoning. To reckon the scope that is provided, four disciples who live 100 years, recall just the fact of an aeon 100,000 times in a day. Figuring a disciple to start his recollections at age 15, that is 4 X 100,000 X 365 x 85 = 124,100,000 aeons. Figuring an aeon at 10,395,902,500 years (103,959,025 sesame seeds removed from a Magadhan Karika one at a time every hundred years (see <a href="../../../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#karika">Magadha Karika</a>) that is  1,290,131,500,250,000,000 years from the time where it was not possible for our Buddha to recall back further. Our Buddha is said to have been the weakest in <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_019.previous.buddhas.htm">the line of known previous Buddhas.</a></p>

						<p>The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that due to the long course of rebirths it is hard to find a being that has not at one time been one's mother.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids abridges and Bhk. Thanissaro condenses into this one the next five suttas. This greatly diminishes the impact. Note that the Buddha speaks of 'beings', not just human beings.  You want to be able to think for a minute after each of these suttas that anyone you can think of has at one time been your mother; that is men, women, children, brothers, sisters, enemies, friends, animals, birds, insects, gods, whatever. Also note that this is not 'mother or father, or ...' but 'mother, father, ...' so that pretty much the spectrum of feelings one reserves for mothers or fathers or ... can be applied to any being.</p>
