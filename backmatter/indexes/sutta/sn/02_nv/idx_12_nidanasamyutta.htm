						<p>The Buddha enumerates the four foods which sustain living and shows their connection to the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada) that result in birth, old age, sickness, and death.<br />
						The Buddha enumerates <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualnidana.htm#ahara">the four foods</a> which sustain living and shows their connection to the chain of interdependent factors (<i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>) that result in birth, old age, sickness, and death.<br />
						Bhk. Thanissaro points out that the foods occupy the position in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> of Upadana, or 'support' (Mrs. Rhys davids 'grasping'; Bhk. Thanissaro's 'clinging/sustenance'). He also warns the reader not to fall into the trap of accepting just one of the several understandings of the mechanism of action of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>: it is not just linear, and it is not just circular, and it is not just a description of the three-lives (past, future, present) involved in becoming an existing being: what it is is the most helpful description of the process of becoming an existing being from multiple perspectives simultaneously. As life itself, it needs to be 'seen' three-dimensionally. It applies to the millisecond-to-millisecond movement of an individual through life, it applies to the full extent of the single life, and it applies to the process of repeated rebirth of the individuality. It is equally helpful in the way it points out the places where the chain can be broken.<br />
						This sutta also shows how it can be said that by making the study of Food one's meditation theme, dukkha, or pain can be brought to an end, arahantship attained.</p>

						<p>After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food.

						<p>The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that any seeker or brahman who does not know and see the links in the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada) has not realized the benefits of being a seeker or brahmin.<br />
						Note that in this version <i>'avijja'</i> or 'blindness' is not listed explicitly. It's place is taken by the statement concerning the seeker or brahman who does not see. The result is the definition of <i>avijja.</i></p>

						<p>The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that any seeker or brahman who does not know and see the links in the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada) has not realized the benefits of being a seeker or brahmin.<br />
						This is a variation of the previous sutta. It is very awkwardly done in the translation (and that was not helped by the abridgment), but it would not be easy to find a way to do it that was not awkward in the written word. It is constructed using a retorical device where one begins with a statement that is unclear and unfinished which is only finished and made clear by a statement at the end. It works to hold the mind of the listener, but in writing just seems to have been badly constructed.</p>

						<p>The Buddha explains the reasoning behind the consummate view of things and the result in the attitude of one of such views.<br />
						An important sutta for understanding why the Four Truths are constructed the way they are. Also in this sutta the 'Middle Way' is defined as the Paticca Samuppada, not, as in the First Sutta, the Eightfold Way. This is not a contradiction: the two are equivalants. "He who sees the Four Truths, sees the Paticca Samuppada; He who sees the Paticca Samuppada sees the Four Truths."</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes how if one teaches even only one link in the Paticca Samuppada one may be called a Dhamma Teacher; if one practices only one link one may be called one who lives the Dhamma of the Dhamma; if one experiences freedom as a consequence of the experience of only one link one may be said to have won Nibbana in this life. He repeats this three-fold formula for each of the links.<br />
						There is a strong hint in this sutta that each of the links in the Paticca Samuppada, if fully understood, encompass each of the other links.</p>

						I did a translation because Mrs. Rhys Davids construction does not make it clear that what is being talked about is how, though the wise man and the fool begin at the same point it is how they deal with the situation that makes the difference.

						<p>Sariputta teaches Wanderers that ask about who causes kammic consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in kammic consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ananda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Ananda remarking on how interesting it is that the whole doctrine could be stated with one word like this, when asked to do so, gives a version of the sequence in detail.<br />
						It is very interesting! Although it is stated in a different way by Ānanda, what is being said is that it is because of deliberate intention resulting from ignorance that 'self' is projected into the contact of consciousness with named forms that is then experienced as "I am experiencing". Consequently it is a matter of eliminating the ignorance that propells this projecting of self into such contact that brings pain to an end. So it is here that personalization is taking place, that is, taking the literal meaning of the syllables of the word <i>saŋkhāra,</i> 'con' + 'make' = 'own-making'.</p>

						<p>Sariputta teaches Venerable Bumija who asks about who causes kammic consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in kammic consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ananda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Gotama goes on to explain that pleasure and pain corespond to the intent with which deeds of body, speech and mind are done. He further explains that intent can originate with the self or with another and can be done by the self either knowingly or without reflection.<br />
						The Pali text in some versions ends <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.025.pali.bd.htm#p13">the first part of Gotama's expansion of this sutta</a> with <i>'avijjāpaccayā va'</i> and in some versions has this phrase as beginning the next section. Woodward, in <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#P171">AN 4.171</a> has opted to use it both at the end of this section and the beginning of the next. Mrs. Rhys Davids <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.025.rhyc.pts.htm#p13">has put it</a> at the beginning of the next section per the PTS text.<br />
						Put at the beginning of the second section, it should also be at the beginning of the next two sections which is how I have reconstructed it here. Bhk. Thanissaro abridges, but appears to indicate that he would follow this plan. Bhk. Bodhi has it only at the end of the first section. It makes bad sense in this position. The idea described there is that it is intent (Bhk. Bodhi's 'volition') that is the basis for the arising of pleasant or painful consequences of deeds. Intent can be ignorant or not, ignorance is not an alternative to intent. The BJT Pali was a complete mess which I have straightened up for the version here.</p>

						The secondary value of this sutta is as an interesting window on the manners and modes of dialogue of the times, and the flexibility of analysis of the paticca samuppada.

						<p>The Buddha casts the Paticca Samuppand in terms of Fourty-four basis of knowledge, explains of what that knowledge consists, and applies that knowledge to the future and the past.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids calls the application of the knowledge to the future and the past 'retrospective knowledge'; Bhk. Bodhi calls it 'knowledge of entailment'. What it is is the drawing of inference. "I see that it is this way now, seeing that it is this way now and can be no other way, I understand (in retrospect) that it will have been such in the past and I understand that in future it will entail a similar process.'<br />
						This sutta is virtually incomprehensible in abridged form and magical when unabridged. What we have here is the key to the three knowledges of the Arahant, the 'tivijja.' Seeing the application of the Paticca Samuppada to the past is the key to seeing past lives; seeing how it applies to the future is the key to seeing the passing away and rising up again of beings according to their deeds, and seeing it as it is in the present is the way to ending the corrupting influences <i>āsavas</i>.<br />
						Purification of each knowledge-base is done by way of seeing, in the mind's eye, actual cases in one's self and in others in terms of each of the bases, past, future, present. 'What is it that keeps me 'being?' What is it that supports that inability to let it go? Is it the desire for sense pleasures? Is it some viewpoint? Is it the belief in ethics and rituals? Is it some experience of self? Does this apply only to me or does it apply to all beings? Does this apply in all cases in the past? In the future?<br />
						This sutta gives us the tools to work through the Paticca Samuppada in detail step-by-step. But it should not be done 'intellectually'! You need to 'see' in pictures exemplifying each step. That takes effort but will prove convincing knowledge.</p>

						<p>In response to a series of questions concerning 'who' experiences the various stages of the Paticca Samuppada, The Buddha explains that these questions assume the idea of an individual or experiencer, and a differentiation between the experience and the experiencer and that such an assumption falls into the trap of postulating an eternal self or a self that is annihilated and that with either of those two extreme views it is not possible to end pain and reach the goal of Arahantship and that this amounts to blindness, but by bringing this blindness to an end and seeing that the process is impersonal the end of pain is attainable and the goal of Arahantship can be reached.<br />

						<p>The Buddha tells Anāthapiṇḍika that when a layman is able to identify in himself that he is free from the five sources of guilty dread in poor ethical behavior, when he has solid faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha, and when he has wised up to the aristocratic method, he may call himself a Streamwinner and assure himself that rebirth below human states is finished.<br />
						Faith in the Buddha is faith that Gotama did in fact achieve the end of pain, faith in the Dhamma is faith that that is the way to do it, faith in the Saŋgha is faith that those in the various stages of awakening are following the path pointed out by Gotama, and that, as such, they are worthy of honor. Understanding the Aristocratic method is understanding the mechanism. It is not just knowledge of the links, but it is actually seeing how this leads to that.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids has translated <i>'ariyo ñāyo'</i> (Aristocratic Method or Noble Method) 'Ariyan truth', which could lead to confusion of this with the 'Ariyan Truths', which would be confusing translation but correct Dhamma and that is actually the basis for her translation. She quotes commentary: 'Buddhaghosa quotes a text which says that the Causal Law and the Eightfold Path are both <i>ñāyo.</i> I would go farther and say that they are two different ways of saying the same thing.</p>

This 'omition' has been added in in brackets by Bhk. Bodhi and Rhys Davids, but I suggest that this is really two different suttas and that the idea of it beginning with nama/rupa is itself instructive. Blindness yielding up own-making is done by an existing nama/rupa with consciousness. The beginning point of the S.P. is not iron-bound to one of it's links. This sort of 'clarification' is frequent in the Burmese edition of the Pali.</p>

						<p>An outline of the practice to be used by the person interested in comprehending the Paticca Samuppada.<br />
						An important sutta for understanding the method of investigation. The word used here is <i>Parivīmaɱsa.</i> <i>Pari</i> = pass-around; <i>vīmaɱsa:</i> re-member, in the sense of pondering over bringing to mind the various aspects of a thing. This is translated by Bhk. Bodhi as 'thorough investigation' which is also used for the translation of <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> (tracing back in memory the origin of a thing). The distinction is that <i>Parivīmaɱsa</i> encompasses <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> and then projects it forward into those insights which should arise from the determination of the origin of a thing. Generally, however, <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> is more frequently encountered and apparently is assumed to result in these insights.<br />
						<i>Vīmaɱsa:</i> should not be confused with <i>vicara,</i> also translated 'pondering,' although <i>vimaɱsa</i> is probably <i>vicara,</i>.<br />
						Also included in this sutta is a test that measures one's understanding. If one is still making plans, one has not yet got a thorough understanding. This means that although one may understand in theory, intellectually, the real job here is 'seeing' or 'knowing': seeing the inevitable progression from own-making to death in the mind's eye in the real world in absolutely every plan-making without exception.</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens contimplation of delight in sense pleasures to throwing fuel on a fire. This is a great example of how early translations influence later translations to the exclusion of reasoned reflection. We must credit Bhk. Thanissaro for a break from 'grasping' and 'clinging' even though he has used 'clinging' in his translation of this sutta. He was first to note that what <i>Upādāna</i> really stood for was 'fuel' that which supports coming into existence. It is not just 'grasping' but must encompass a much broader spectrum of ideas. The literal meaning of the word is 'Up-giving' or 'up-binding'. We say 'fuel-up'. I have used 'bind-up' and 'support' in an effort to stick closer to the etymology and have used 'fuel' or 'fueling' occasionally. In any case this sutta should have openened everyone's eyes, but the early translator's understanding of the Paticca Samuppada as a progressive series of causes made them seek out a word which more closely fit their idea of what would result in the coming to be of an individual and blinded everyone to the idea that what this was was the work of mind, pondering, wishing and intending that fueled the fire of existence.</p>

						Very similar to the previous sutta, the distinction to be drawn from the similes is that while <i>upādāna</i> is strictly 'fueling', the saññojana involves other maintenance tasks. One does not just add more oil, one must also trim the wick. That's the wiki-wacki-wiki.</p>

							<p class="f4">The contimplation of the pleasures to be found in sense experience is the fuel or underlying motivation, the yokes to rebirth (viewpoints concerning self, doubts, trust in good works and ethical conduct, wanting pleasure, deviance, lust for material things, lust for immaterial things, pride, fear and blindness) are the mechanisms, the means of maintenance, the actions of fueling, that are used by the individual to keep the flame burning. One needs to eliminate both, but the elimination of one eliminates the other. An important distinction that is the explanation I was looking for to point out why ideas such as 'grasping' are not a good translation for <i>'upādāna'.</i> And if you will permit I will suggest also that this is the real meaning of Dhamma Research. Bear down on what is actually being said by Gotama, and even the sequences of the suttas, and it will be seen that the questions that arise in one's mind have been anticipated and answered by The Buddha. The Dhamma teaches the translator how to translate.</p>

						Here Mrs. Rhys Davids confronts the clear indication that <i>upādāna</i> means fuel by stating that it means fuel and grasping equally. PED has 'grasping' and such as meaning #2. It looks to me as though in all cases 'fueled' would do and would be more clear. Does a fire 'cling' to the wood? (Well, there was this belief at one point, and it is interesting to think that the fire by that consumes/desroys the wood.) I think the whole idea of grasping is encompassed earlier in the sequence by the idea of <i>taṇhā,</i> or thirst.<br />
						Why repeat the previous sutta for a young tree? Possibly because some young trees might not recognize themselves in the image of a great tree. Possibly some teaching Dhamma might think the idea applied only to great trees.</p>

In other words he has placed this thinking about such things in the position of blindness resulting in own-making resulting in consciousness resulting in named-shapes. Again note that the idea is not 'cause' but 'a descent of' as though named-shapes were a previously existing phenomena that attached themselves to own-making.

						<p>The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he compairs the mind to a monkey traveling from branch to branch.<br />
						An interesting point to be noted in this sutta is the way the Buddha speaks of 'this very heart' <i>(citta)</i> or 'this very mind' <i>(mano)</i> or 'this very consciousness' <i>(viññāṇa)</i> as being synonyms for each other in essentially the same way we think about these things.</p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he describes how it is that consciousness arises through contact, sense-experience and perception and that it is by perceiving that that detachment leads to freedom and the knowledge of freedom.<br />
						This sutta begins as the previous, omits the simile of the monkey, and finishes with what is essentially a condensation of the <i>Paṭicca Samuppāda</i> into four steps: contact, sense-experience, perception and consciousness.</p>

						<p>Maha-Kotthita puts questions about the Paticca Samuppada to Sariputta. He frames his questions in the form of the four basic propositions about existence put into questions about whether or not the links in the Paticca Samuppada are created by the self or other or both or neither.<br />
						Sāriputta's responses are followed by the 36 statements made in <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p16">SN 2.16.</a><br />
						Rather than dispute with the other translations item by item, I have taken Mrs. Rhys Davids' translation and completely reworked it closely following the Pali. It amounts to almost a completely new translation but taking less than half the time of doing a complete new translation.<br />
						The interesting and important thing in this sutta is the simile, which if given careful thought clears up any doubt as to what it is that the Paticca Samuppada is really saying. It is important to understand that this is not a simile about the coming into existence of the sheaves of reeds. In the simile the sheaves of reeds already exist. The simile is about the ability of the two sheaves of reeds to stand upright only insofar as they are supported by one another. We are here given insight into the meaning of the term <a id="paccaya">'paccaya',</a> that is, that it means to lean on, support, or to be depended on. (Also, Bhk. Thanissaro's 'requisite condition') Here: 'supported by birth is aging and death' or 'depending on birth is aging and death'. This pretty much fundamentally changes all previous translations of the Paticca Samuppada that ... um ... support the idea of creation or cause. I have used dependence, but also 'result' which is not quite correct and which I will as time and opportunity allows alter throughout this site to conform with this more precise understanding. Some persons are brought to understanding through similes.</p>

						<p>Venerable Savittha questions the Venerable Musila about whether or not apart from belief, inclination, hearsay, argument as to method, reflection on and approval of an opinion, he has, as his very own, the knowledge of the various steps of the Paticca Samuppada and of the knowledge that the ending of becoming is Nibbana. In all cases he states that he has such knowldge. And when the Venerable Savittha declares him an arahant he remains silent. Then the Venerable Narada, who has overheard this dialogue asks that the same questions be asked of him and when asked he responds in the same way. But when Savittha pronounces him too an arahant, Narada explains that while he has personal knowledge of these things, he has not attained them. And he gives the simile of the thirsty man who comes across a well with no means to retrieve the water.<br />
						It is an interesting mystery here as to what exactly Narada has accomplished. Has he just made the fact known that it is possible to know and see the goal without having achieved it, or is he making some statement concerning Musila's attainment and Savittha's understanding of what constitutes arahantship? Ananda, who is present during this dialogue makes a statement which seems to point to the latter case.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids translates 'bhava' as 'becoming' which is not incorrect, but in it's place in the Paticca Samuppada it has more to do with the potential for being such and such a sort of so and so in some place of being, rather than the process of becoming such. Elsewhere she objects strenuously to the statement that the ending of becoming is Nibbāna as her whole position is that the Buddha's doctrine is the teaching of an on-going becoming. But this misses the point of the Paticca Samuppada which defines being as a matter of blindness to the fact that personal identification with acts intended to create the experience of becoming result in Pain.</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens the momentum of ignorance to the way the rise and fall of the sea-level influences the momentum of the flow of water in the great rivers, streams, lakes, and feeder streams.<br />
						This sutta poses some difficulties with regard to making the simile comport with the message. The words to understand here are <i>upaya</i> (PED: approach, undertaking, taking up; clinging to, attachment ... in an- (<i>anūpaya metri causa</i>) not going near, aloof, unattached) from <i>upa-upāya,</i> and <i>apaya</i> from <i>an-upāya</i> (I say), which would have the meaning here not of rise or fall, but of flow or impeded momentum.<br />
						There is a phenomena seen in rivers emptying into the ocean of a reverse of flow at flood-tide; but it effects the flow of the river for only a short distance back into the land and it's hard to think that there is any effect at all on the feeder streams or further back. It may happen at a certain very subtle level. I would read the Pali: 'A rise in the ocean impeeds access to it by the river, etc.'</p>

						<p>Susima enters the order to learn the secret of Gotama's ability to generate respect and donatives. There he hears about bhikkhus gaining Arahantship and quesions them about super-normal powers. These bhikkhus tell him they have no super-normal powers and have been awakened through wisdom. Questioning the Buddha about this he learns to appreciate the Dhamma and confesses his earlier bad intentions.<br />
						Apart from the controversy as to whether or not this sutta is evidence that Arahantship can be gained without experience of jhana this sutta has another difficult issue to deal with. The bhikkhus that have declared Arahantship <i>(Aññā)</i> have said they did so by way of Wisdom. The thing to note is that in response to being questioned by Susima about this, the Buddha asks him a series of questions which when complete imply the definition of the method of attaining arahantship by way of wisdom (knowing and seeing the Paticca Samuppada) along with the idea that knowledge and vision have arisen without attaining magic powers. We can see that that Susima knows and sees, but he has not declared Arahantship. Knowing and seeing are not the same thing as Arahantship. But Susima (and the reader) can, on knowing and seeing according to this method see that it does not necessarily involve these attainments.</p>
