					<h4>II. <i>Āhārā Vagga,</i> II.11</h4>

						<p class="in1"><b><a id="p11">11.</a> <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.011.pali.bd.htm"><i>Āhārā Suttaṃ,</i></a> II.11</b></p>

						<p>The Buddha enumerates <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualnidana.htm#ahara">the four foods</a> which sustain living and shows their connection to the chain of interdependent factors (<i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>) that result in birth, old age, sickness, and death.<br />
						<i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro points out that the foods occupy the position in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> of <i>Upadana,</i> or 'support' (Mrs. Rhys Davids 'grasping'; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's 'clinging/sustenance'). He also warns the reader not to fall into the trap of accepting just one of the several understandings of the mechanism of action of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda:</i> it is not just linear, and it is not just circular, and it is not just a description of the three-lives (past, future, present) involved in becoming an existing being: what it is is the most helpful description of the process of becoming an existing being from multiple perspectives simultaneously. As life itself, it needs to be 'seen' three-dimensionally. It applies to the millisecond-to-millisecond movement of an individual through life, it applies to the full extent of the single life, and it applies to the process of repeated rebirth of the individuality. It is equally helpful in the way it points out the places where the chain can be broken.<br />
						This sutta also shows how it can be said that by making the study of food one's meditation theme, <i>dukkha,</i> or pain can be brought to an end, arahantship attained.</p>

						<p>After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food.

						<p>The Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> that any seeker or Brahman who does not know and see the links in the chain of interdependent factors <i>(paṭicca samuppāda)</i> has not realized the benefits of being a seeker or Brahmin.<br />
						Note that in this version <i>'a-vijja'</i> or 'blindness' is not listed explicitly. Its place is taken by the statement concerning the seeker or Brahman who does not see. The result is the definition of <i>a-vijja.</i></p>

						This is a variation of the previous sutta. It is very awkwardly done in the translation (and that was not helped by the abridgment), but it would not be easy to find a way to do it that was not awkward in the written word. It is constructed using a rhetorical device where one begins with a statement that is unclear and unfinished which is only finished and made clear by a statement at the end. It works to hold the mind of the listener, but in writing just seems to have been badly constructed.</p>

						<p>The Buddha explains the reasoning behind the consummate view of things and the result in the attitude of one of such views.<br />
						An important sutta for understanding why the Four Truths are constructed the way they are. Also in this sutta the 'Middle Way' is defined as the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> not, as in the First Sutta, the Eightfold Way. This is not a contradiction: the two are equivalents.

						<p>Kassapa, a naked ascetic, asks the Buddha a series of questions about the source of pain and to each of his questions receives the response, 'it is not such as that.'

						<p>Timbaruka asks the Buddha a series of questions about the source of pain and pleasure and to each of his questions receives the response, 'it is not such as that.'

						<p>Sariputta teaches Wanderers that ask about who causes <i>kammic</i> consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in <i>kammic</i> consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Ānanda remarking on how interesting it is that the whole doctrine could be stated with one word like this, when asked to do so, gives a version of the sequence in detail.<br />
						It is very interesting! Although it is stated in a different way by Ānanda, what is being said is that it is because of deliberate intention resulting from ignorance that 'self' is projected into the contact of consciousness with named forms that is then experienced as "I am experiencing". Consequently it is a matter of eliminating the ignorance that propels this projecting of self into such contact that brings pain to an end. So it is here that personalization is taking place, that is, taking the literal meaning of the syllables of the word <i>saṇkhāra,</i> 'con' + 'make' = 'own-making'.</p>

						<p>Sariputta teaches Venerable Bumija who asks about who causes <i>kammic</i> consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in <i>kammic</i> consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Gotama goes on to explain that pleasure and pain correspond to the intent with which deeds of body, speech and mind are done. He further explains that intent can originate with the self or with another and can be done by the self either knowingly or without reflection.<br />
						The <i>Pāḷi</i> text in some versions ends <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.025.pali.bd.htm#p13">the first part of Gotama's expansion of this sutta</a> with <i>'avijjā-paccayā va'</i> and in some versions has this phrase as beginning the next section.

						Put at the beginning of the second section, it should also be at the beginning of the next two sections which is how I have reconstructed it here. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro abridges, but appears to indicate that he would follow this plan. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has it only at the end of the first section. It makes bad sense in this position. The idea described there is that it is intent (Bhk. Bodhi's 'volition') that is the basis for the arising of pleasant or painful consequences of deeds. Intent can be ignorant or not, ignorance is not an alternative to intent. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> was a complete mess which I have straightened up a little for the version here.</p>

						<p>The Buddha casts the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> in terms of forty basis of knowledge, explains of what that knowledge consists, and applies that knowledge to the future and the past.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids calls the application of the knowledge to the future and the past 'retrospective knowledge'; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi calls it 'knowledge of entailment'. What it is the drawing of inference. "I see that it is this way now, seeing that it is this way now and can be no other way, I understand (in retrospect) that it will have been such in the past and I understand that in future it will entail a similar process.'<br />
						This sutta is virtually incomprehensible in abridged form and magical when unabridged. What we have here is the key to the three knowledges of the Arahant, the <i>'tivijja.'</i> Seeing the application of the <i>(paṭicca samuppāda)</i> to the past is the key to seeing past lives; seeing how it applies to the future is the key to seeing the passing away and rising up again of beings according to their deeds, and seeing it as it is in the present is the way to ending the corrupting influences <i>āsavas.</i><br />
						Purification of each knowledge-base is done by way of seeing, in the mind's eye, actual cases in one's self and in others in terms of each of the bases, past, future, present. 'What is it that keeps me 'being?' What is it that supports that inability to let it go? Is it the desire for sense pleasures? Is it some viewpoint? Is it the belief in ethics and rituals? Is it some experience of self? Does this apply only to me or does it apply to all beings? Does this apply in all cases in the past? In the future?<br />
						This sutta gives us the tools to work through the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> in detail step-by-step. But it should not be done 'intellectually'! You need to 'see' in pictures exemplifying each step. That takes effort but will prove convincing knowledge.</p>

						Almost identical to the previous but without the questioner. Mrs. Rhys Davids abridges completely. Here the BJT is in conformity with the PTS and CSCD in having the question posed as a single compound question. I suspect the first BJT was made to conform to the Rhys Davids translation.</p>

						<p>The Buddha tells Anāthapiṇḍika that when a layman is able to identify in himself that he is free from the five sources of guilty dread in poor ethical behavior, when he has solid faith in the Buddha, <i>Dhamma</i> and <i>Saṇgha,</i> and when he has wised up to the aristocratic method, he may call himself a Streamwinner and assure himself that rebirth below human states is finished.<br />
						Faith in the Buddha is faith that Gotama did in fact achieve the end of pain, faith in the <i>Dhamma</i> is faith that that is the way to do it, faith in the <i>Saṇgha</i> is faith that those in the various stages of awakening are following the path pointed out by Gotama, and that, as such, they are worthy of honor. Understanding the Aristocratic method is understanding the mechanism. It is not just knowledge of the links, but it is actually seeing how this leads to that.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids has translated <i>'ariyo ñāyo'</i> (Aristocratic Method or Noble Method) 'Ariyan truth', which could lead to confusion of this with the 'Ariyan Truths', which would be confusing translation but correct <i>Dhamma</i> and that is actually the basis for her translation. She quotes commentary: 'Buddhaghosa quotes a text which says that the Causal Law and the Eightfold Path are both <i>ñāyo.</i> I would go farther and say that they are two different ways of saying the same thing.</p>

						<p>An outline of the practice to be used by the person interested in comprehending the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i><br />
						An important sutta for understanding the method of investigation. The word used here is <i>pari-vīmaṃsa.</i> <i>pari</i> = pass-around, (thorough); <i>vīmaṃsa:</i> re-member, in the sense of pondering over bringing to mind the various aspects of a thing. This is translated by <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi as 'thorough investigation' which is also used by him for the translation of <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> (tracing back in memory the origin of a thing). The distinction is that <i>pari-vīmaṃsa</i> encompasses <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> and then projects it forward into those insights which should arise from the determination of the origin of a thing. Generally, however, <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> is more frequently encountered and apparently is assumed to result in these insights.<br />
						<i>Vīmaṃsa:</i> should not be confused with <i>vicara,</i> also translated 'pondering,' although <i>vimaṃsa</i> is probably <i>vicara.</i><br />
						Also included in this sutta is a test that measures one's understanding. If one is still making plans, one has not yet got a thorough understanding. This means that although one may understand in theory, intellectually, the real job here is 'seeing' or 'knowing': seeing the inevitable progression from own-making to death in the mind's eye in the real world in absolutely every plan-making without exception.</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens contemplation of delight in sense pleasures to throwing fuel on a fire. This is a great example of how early translations influence later translations to the exclusion of reasoned reflection. We must credit <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro for a break from 'grasping' and 'clinging' even though he has used 'clinging' in his translation of this sutta. He was first to note that what <i>Upādāna</i> really stood for was 'fuel' that which supports coming into existence. It is not just 'grasping' but must encompass a much broader spectrum of ideas. The literal meaning of the word is 'Up-giving' or 'up-binding'. We say 'fuel-up'. I have used 'bind-up' and 'support' in an effort to stick closer to the etymology and have used 'fuel' or 'fueling' occasionally. In any case this sutta should have opened everyone's eyes, but the early translator's understanding of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> as a progressive series of causes made them seek out a word which more closely fit their idea of what would result in the coming to be of an individual and blinded everyone to the idea that what this was the work of mind, pondering, wishing and intending that fueled the fire of existence.</p>

						<p>The Buddha likens the yokes to rebirth to the maintenance necessary to keep an oil lamp burning.<br />
						Very similar to the previous sutta, the distinction to be drawn from the similes is that while <i>upādāna</i> is strictly 'fueling', the <i>saññojana</i> implies that an obsession with such is a binding to it such as with a yoke. One does not just add more oil, one must also get involved: trim the wick. That's the wiki-wacki-wiki.</p>

							<p class="f4">The contemplation of the pleasures to be found in sense experience is the fuel or underlying motivation, the yokes to rebirth (viewpoints concerning self, doubts, trust in good works and ethical conduct, wanting pleasure, deviance, lust for material things, lust for immaterial things, pride, fear and blindness) are the mechanisms, the means of maintenance, the actions of fueling, that are used by the individual to keep the flame burning. One needs to eliminate both, but the elimination of one eliminates the other. An important distinction that is the explanation I was looking for to point out why ideas such as 'grasping' are not a good translation for <i>'upādāna'.</i> And if you will permit I will suggest also that this is the real meaning of <i>Dhamma</i> Research. Bear down on what is actually being said by Gotama and it will be seen that the questions that arise in one's mind have been anticipated and answered by The Buddha.

						<p>The Buddha likens the contemplation of that which yokes one to rebirth to the prospects of a young tree that is well tended and recommends in stead chopping that young tree down and destroying it completely.<br />
						Here Mrs. Rhys Davids confronts the clear indication that <i>upādāna</i> means fuel by stating that it means fuel and grasping equally. PED has 'grasping' and such as meaning #2. It looks to me as though in all cases 'fueled' would do and would be more clear. Does a fire 'cling' to the wood? (Well, there was this belief at one point, and it is interesting to think that the fire by that consumes/destroys the wood.) I think the whole idea of grasping is encompassed earlier in the sequence by the idea of <i>taṇhā,</i> or thirst.<br />
						Why repeat the previous sutta for a young tree? Possibly because some young trees might not recognize themselves in the image of a great tree. Possibly some teaching <i>Dhamma</i> might think the idea applied only to great trees.</p>

						A variation of #55 above, but in this case in stead of saying that such contemplations lead to fueling rebirth, he states that they lead to a 'descent' of named-forms. In other words he has placed this thinking about such things in the position of blindness resulting in own-making resulting in consciousness resulting in named-forms. Again note that the idea is not 'cause' but 'a descent of' as though named-forms were a previously existing phenomena that attached themselves to own-making. I am not suggesting that there is any actual pre-existing named-form, but only that it is 'like that'. We are talking about the arising (or descent) of an illusion which does not require any 'substance,' pre- or post.</p>

						<p>Maha-Kotthita puts questions about the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> to Sariputta. He frames his questions in the form of the four basic propositions about existence put into questions about whether or not the links in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> are created by the self or other or both or neither.<br />
						Sāriputta's responses are followed by the thirty-six statements made in <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p16">SN 2.16.</a><br />
						Rather than dispute with the other translations item by item, for my version I have taken Mrs. Rhys Davids' translation and completely reworked it closely following the <i>Pāḷi.</i> It amounts to almost a completely new translation but taking less than half the time of doing a complete new translation.<br />
						The interesting and important thing in this sutta is the simile, which if given careful thought clears up any doubt as to what it is that the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> is really saying. It is important to understand that this is not a simile about the coming into existence of the sheaves of reeds. In the simile the sheaves of reeds already exist. The simile is about the ability of the two sheaves of reeds to stand upright only insofar as they are supported by one another. We are here given insight into the meaning of the term <a id="paccaya">'paccaya',</a> that is, that it means to lean on, support, or to be depended on. (Also, <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's 'requisite condition') Here: 'supported by birth is aging and death' or 'depending on birth is aging and death'. This pretty much fundamentally changes all previous translations of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> that ... um ... support the idea of creation or cause. I have used dependence and also 'result'.</p>

						<p>Venerable Savittha questions the Venerable Musila about whether or not apart from belief, inclination, hearsay, argument as to method, reflection on and approval of an opinion, he has, as his very own, the knowledge of the various steps of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> and of the knowledge that the ending of becoming is <i>Nibbāna.</i> In all cases he states that he has such knowledge. And when the Venerable Savittha declares him an arahant he remains silent. Then the Venerable Narada, who has overheard this dialogue asks that the same questions be asked of him and when asked he responds in the same way. But when Savittha pronounces him too an arahant, Narada explains that while he has personal knowledge of these things, he has not attained them. And he gives the simile of the thirsty man who comes across a well with no means to retrieve the water.<br />
						It is an interesting mystery here as to what exactly Narada has accomplished. Has he just made the fact known that it is possible to know and see the goal without having achieved it, or is he making some statement concerning Musila's attainment and Savittha's understanding of what constitutes arahantship? Ānanda, who is present during this dialogue makes a statement which seems to point to the latter case.<br />
						Mrs. Rhys Davids translates <i>'bhava'</i> as 'becoming' which is not incorrect, but in its place in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> it has more to do with the potential for being such and such a sort of so and so in some place of being, rather than the process of becoming such. Elsewhere she objects strenuously to the statement that the ending of becoming is <i>Nibbāna</i> as her whole position is that the Buddha's doctrine is the teaching of an on-going becoming. But this misses the point of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> which defines being as a matter of blindness to the fact that personal identification with acts intended to create the experience of becoming result in pain.</p>

The words to understand here are <i>upaya</i> (PED: approach, undertaking, taking up; clinging to, attachment ... in <i>an-</i> (<i>anūpaya metri causa</i>) not going near, aloof, unattached) from <i>upa-upāya,</i> and <i>apaya</i> from <i>an-upāya</i> (I say), which would have the meaning here not of rise or fall, but of flow or impeded momentum.<br />
						There is a phenomena seen in rivers emptying into the ocean of a reverse of flow at flood-tide; but it effects the flow of the river for only a short distance back into the land and it's hard to think that there is any effect at all on the feeder streams or further back.

						<p>Susima enters the order to learn the secret of Gotama's ability to generate respect and donatives.

These <i>bhikkhus</i> tell him they have no super-normal powers and have been awakened through wisdom.

						Apart from the controversy as to whether or not this sutta is evidence that Arahantship can be gained without experience of <i>jhāna</i> this sutta has another difficult issue to deal with. The <i>bhikkhus</i> that have declared Arahantship <i>(Aññā)</i> have said they did so by way of Wisdom. The thing to note is that in response to being questioned by Susima about this, the Buddha asks him a series of questions which when complete imply the definition of the method of attaining arahantship by way of wisdom (knowing and seeing the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>) along with the idea that knowledge and vision have arisen without attaining magic powers. We can see that Susima knows and sees, but he has not declared Arahantship. Knowing and seeing are not the same thing as Arahantship. But Susima (and the reader) can, on knowing and seeing according to this method see that it does not necessarily involve these attainments.</p>
