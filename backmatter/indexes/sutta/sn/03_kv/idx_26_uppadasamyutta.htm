							<p>Here Woodward has come around to the understanding that what is required for the object of the eye-sense is sights in general, not just body. (See <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.25.006.pali.bd.htm">SN 3.25.6</a>) He translates 'material forms'. It has taken him three go-rounds to come to consciousness of this relationship. I remember when I first began reading the suttas I was astounded: This guy (The Buddha) is trying to teaching us about the senses! I learned about the senses in the third grade. (Minus, of course, the idea that the mind was also a sense-organ. ... a slight omission.) But the fact of the matter is that we are so accustomed to living in the senses that we do not actually have a clear view of their workings, that it is a struggle to connect in our conscious thinking the objects of sense with the sense organs. And it is essential for the task of attaining freedom from existence that the six senses and their objects be understood for a comprehension of the relationship of the illusion of self to this world. As an aside, I argue that in the same way, the language used for translating the <i>Pāḷi</i> must be as fundamental (literal) as possible for the same reason: It is only when the foundation is firmly established that one can be sure that the abstract is not a distortion. I am completely convinced that Gotama's choice of words was selected precisely for this reason and that that choice should be respected, must be respected to convey his ideas clearly.</p>
