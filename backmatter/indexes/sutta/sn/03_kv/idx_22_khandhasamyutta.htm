						<p>The Buddha instructs the <i>bhikkhus</i> to develop serenity for seeing the origin and ending of form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness.<br />
						Note in my translation the use of 'counterpart' as a translation for <i>'paṭicca'</i> in an effort to get away from 'cause' and even 'condition'; the use of 'serenity' for <i>'samādhi'</i> in order to point to the fact that <i>samādhi</i> is more than just concentration; and the use of 'self-arising' for <i>'samudaya'</i> in an effort to point out the <i>'sam'</i> that seldom appears in the translation of this term. What the Buddha is always talking about is not the original creation of things, but the identified-with existence of things. Form has existence only in so far as it is experienced by an individual. That does not mean that the individual is creating form. It only means that the individual has created the experience of form. 'It is the diversity of data that results in the diversity of perceptions; it is not the diversity of perceptions that results in the diversity of data. <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.14.008.olds.bd.htm">SN 2.14.8 - olds</a></p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness were unstable in the past, will be unstable the future and are unstable in the present and that therefore the wise person practices to let these things go.<br />
						Note the order: Past, Future, Present. This is the order used throughout the suttas (in spite of some translations indicating otherwise). The reason is to be found in the understanding of the nature of mind to proceed according to instructions. Think of the way a search tool looks for what is sought as literally described. [First examine the past, then examine the future, then examine the present.] We do not want it dwelling in the past or anticipating the future, so we direct the mind to reflection on the way things were in the past, then the way things will be in the future, then set it down to reflect on the way things are in the present. Also note that there is no actual term in <i>Pāḷi</i> for 'the present'. Here it is <i>Paccuppanna</i> 'that which confronts' or has risen up in our face, literally the 'percussively-uprisen'. Elsewhere it is <i>'diṭṭha-dhamma'</i> this 'seen thing'. The reason? Change is seen to make it impossible to locate any point in time that could be called a 'present moment'. Even in that which confronts us different objects are changing at different rates and further, by the nature of perception being consequent on contact giving rise to consciousness, all that which we understand to be 'the present' is really already in the past.</p>

					<h4>I.III. <i>Bhāra Vagga,</i> III.25</h4>

						<p class="in1"><b>[<a id="p22">22</a>] <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.022.pali.bd.htm"><i>Bhāra Suttaṃ,</i></a> III.25</b></p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches that the five stockpiles (<i>khandha:</i> body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness) amount to a burden, that the assumption of individuality can be termed the grasping of the burden, that desire for experience through the senses, desire to be, and the desire for more being, un-being, or re-being is the lifting up of the burden, and that the laying down of the burden is the utter eradication of desire.<br />
						This sutta has sparked extra interest by the translators because of an assumption made by an early western commentator (as noted in a footnote on the Woodward translation) that where there is a grabbing hold, taking up, and laying down, there must be a grabber, a take-holder, and a let-goer and that therefore this sutta proves that the Buddha taught the existence of a being outside the <i>khandhas.</i> This is the error of reading into what one reads what is not written into what one is reading. The Buddha did not teach the non-existence of the self, but neither did he teach the existence of the self. What he taught was the process that results in existence and that the problem with existence was the fact of its coming to an end, and this, and only this is what is taught in this sutta.<br />
						There is a problem for translators in translation of the term <i>'vibhava'. vi</i> = re, un, and 2: re - in the sense of doubling or increase; <i>bhava</i> = being, living, existing. Woodward assumes that any meaning other than 'un' for this word is a later development. I am not sure there is a good basis for that assumption. It is equally possible that Gotama chose that term precisely because of its multiple meanings.</p>

						This sutta is a variation on the previous. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has it arranged such as to have the conclusion applied to each of the five initial statements. If this were the case it should be applied to the previous sutta as well. However if such an arrangement were correct it would amount to saying that by correctly seeing any single one of the <i>khandhas,</i> one could attain arahantship. This is not to say that this is not a possibility, as there is some support for this notion in that it can be argued that for the thorough comprehension of one a thorough comprehension of them all is needed, thus it could be said that the goal was achieved through the one. See the next sutta.<br />
						It might have been corrected in later versions, but my copy of the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> for this entire book contains a great number of errors of the copy and paste variety. It looks like it went through some sort of initial setup and then was forgotten.</p>

						<p>The Buddha defines what he calls the stockpiles <i>(khandha)</i> and what he calls the fueled stockpiles <i>(upādāna-k-khandha).</i><br />
						A very important distinction is made here between <i>khandha</i> and <i>upādāna-k-khandha.</i> It is not form, sense-experience, perception, the own-made, and consciousness themselves that are the fuel supporting existence and rebirth; it is the delight with, the obsession with the lust, anger and blindness associated with these things that is that fuel. The distinction is being made between that which is already done, or that which exists externally, and that which is being contemplated, the subject of obsession, lust, anger and blindness. Body as seen objectively and body as seen in conjunction with the idea 'my'. If one is going to use the translation 'grasping' or 'clinging' for <i>'upadana',</i> then the translation of <i>'upadana-k-khandha'</i> would be 'grasped-after-form ...' or 'clung-to-form.' Woodward here uses 'factor that has to do with grasping' which passes, elsewhere he has used 'grasping-heaps' which gives the wrong sense: the heap is not grasping! That's something out of a horror movie. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has 'subject to clinging' and has used 'affected by clinging' both of which are misdirections: the idea is that it is clinging to, or grasping after or the fueling based on or connected with body, etc, that gives rise to existence; this is not pointing to a thing there that is a clinging-affected body or a body that has been subjected to clinging. ... or maybe it is. Body is something that has become by way of clinging. But then if this term is to stand for both the obsessing that arises based on body and the body that arises based on obsessing, the term to be found must reflect both sides of the picture.<br />
						The stockpiles are one of the ways in which the Buddha has broken into smaller units everything in existence. The distinction between the stockpiles and the fueled stockpiles is that the fueled stockpiles are, as the name indicates, stockpiles fueled by the corrupting influences of lust, existence and blindness. In other words they have become the objects of the intent to experience sense-pleasures, existence, or the product of some point of view. The distinction is very clearly drawn in this sutta, but is it correct to draw the conclusion that it is saying that the <i>khandhas</i> exist separately from individuality? Identifying with the <i>khandhas,</i> or one of them, or holding opinions about the self (as per the previous sutta) they are <i>upadana-k-khandha;</i> seen externally, objectively, they are just <i>khandha.</i> When the <i>āsavas</i> have been destroyed in the living Arahant, the <i>khandhas</i> are seen to carry on for the remainder of the lifespan of the being who became arahant. Subsequent to the 'visible' death of the Arahant, the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness <i>dhatu</i> break apart, separate off and he makes no further <i>khandhas</i> the object of intent to experience sensory existence and <i>for him</i> without such intent, because he has destroyed the <i>āsavas,</i> do not arise again. So from two perspectives (the living arahant, and the separation from body, etc. of the living being from the <i>khandhas</i> at death) we can see that there is a distinction between <i>khandhas</i> that are fueled and those that are no longer fueled, but we cannot say that there is any sustained or autonomous existence of the <i>khandhas</i> separate from individuality.</p>

						This is the basic reasoning behind the idea of not-self and follows logically from the doctrines laid out in the first sutta on the idea that the seeker should not go down either the path of self-indulgence or the path of self punishment; seeing that that which has become is subject to ending; seeing that ending is a word for pain; seeing that the source of this pain is thirst; that the way to end the pain is to end the thirst; and the way to end the thirst is to understand, to conform one's behavior, and to make real the parameters outlined by the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way.<br />
						The Mendis translation also has a description of the events surrounding this sutta and an exposition of his understanding of the whole doctrine, but has two flaws: he speaks of 'No Self' in his discussion (which is an extreme view and an incorrect understanding of <i>'anatta'</i>) but has it correctly as 'not-self' in his translation; and he says that the disciples had insight into 'the impermanence of anything which had a conditioned origin' — another case of the misunderstanding that arises from the mis-translation of <i>saṅkhārā</i> (own-making see: <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is <i>Nibbāna</i> Conditioned,</a> discussion).

						Although the term here is not <i>'bhikkhu'</i> (beggar), but <i>'pindola'</i> scrap hunter, or 'dole-man', someone on the dole, the spirit is the same. Many of the 'monks' of today object strenuously to being called 'beggars' and have completely missed the point: It is by adopting the lowest of callings that pride of birth is humbled and by showing those who are beggars as a consequence of their bad <i>kamma,</i> that such a life can be lived with ease, generosity, virtue and dignity. It teaches the way out of their misery. The translation of <i>'bhikkhu'</i> as 'monk' and of <i>'pindola'</i> as 'almsman' or 'mendicant' whitewashes the truth and destroys the lesson.<br />

That Assaji would almost certainly have been called here 'Assaji Thera', where this Assaji is called '<i>āyasmā</i> Assaji, 'Elder'.

						<p>A dialogue between Venerable Khema and a group of elder <i>bhikkhus</i> concerning identification with the five fuel stockpiles <i>(khandhas).</i><br />
						This is a very instructive sutta told with a wonderful sense of humor.

						"Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, still, in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging, there lingers in him a residual conceit 'I am,' a desire 'I am,' an underlying tendency 'I am' that has not yet been uprooted."<br />

						Woodward translates <i>'avijjā'</i> and <i>'vijjā'</i> as 'ignorance' and 'wisdom'; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi translates them 'ignorance' and 'true knowledge'. 'Ignorance' has pretty much established itself in the general consciousness but it is not quite accurate. The word means 'not-vision' and its opposite should be the opposite of whatever word is used for that (or the other way around). Wisdom is having vision <i>plus</i> having knowledge of the ways that vision is best used in a broad scope of applications. The better translation is closer to <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's but there is no 'true' there. It is really 'vision', 'seeing'. Additionally 'wisdom' has been and is better used for <i>'paññā'</i> (<i>pan</i> knowing).</p>

						There appears to me to be some confusion between this and the previous sutta. In the first the only question asked is what makes a <i>Dhamma</i> teacher but three questions are answered. In the second three questions are asked which correspond to the answers given in both suttas. Further complicating the issue Woodward makes the second question in the second sutta ask about teaching about living the <i>Dhamma</i> following the <i>Dhamma,</i> which is not being asked and does not correspond to the answer. It seems the first sutta should have asked only the first question and been given only the first answer, and the second sutta which asks all three questions should follow (without Woodward's interjection of 'is one a teacher of').</p>

					<h4>III.IV. <i>Kukkula-Vagga,</i> III.177</h4>

						<p class="in1"><b>[<a id="p136">136</a>] <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.136.pali.bd.htm"><i>Kukkula Suttaṃ,</i></a> III.177</b></p>

						<p>The Buddha describes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness as glowing embers.<br />
						The controversy mentioned in this sutta is a tempest in a teapot which emanates from one side rigidly holding the position that everything is painful, not acknowledging transitory pleasures as being nevertheless pleasures; while the other side refuses to see that seen from the point of view of the ultimate result this is a legitimate position. Pleasure in this world is an observable fact, it is also observable that it always ends in pain. Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of <i>'saṅkhārā'</i> as 'conditioned' rather than 'own-made' or, at least 'constructed' in <i>Pts. of Contr.</i> only serves to confuse the issue.<br />
						What is going on here is important to note. It is essentially the same problem as trying to understand the notion of 'not-self' versus 'no self'. The difference between the statement (or interpretation of a statement made by another) of an observable fact and the statement of an opinion. Either of the two statements, 'the all (the world, the <i>khandhas,</i> etc.) is painful' or 'there is pleasure in the all ...' are true as far as they go. It is when the idea jumps to the categorical "everything, all (not 'the all') is ..." that the statement has become opinion. And, since an opinion concerning 'all' would require of the opinion-holder the knowledge of all things at all times which is not possible, such opinion crosses over into error.</p>

						Once again we have this very curious saying. Woodward doubts his own translation.

In the same way <i>'sammā'</i> should not be being translated 'right' although in that case there is etymological justification.
