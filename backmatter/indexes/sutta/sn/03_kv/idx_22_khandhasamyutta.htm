						<p>The Buddha instructs the bhikkhus to develop serenity for seeing the origin and ending of form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness.<br />
						Note in my translation the use of 'counterpart' as a translation for <i>'paṭicca'</i> in an effort to get away from 'cause' and even 'condition'; the use of 'serenity' for <i>'samādhi'</i> in order to point to the fact that <i>samādhi</i> is more than just concentration; and the use of 'arising to self' for <i>'samudaya'</i> in an effort to point out the <i>'sam'</i> that seldom appears in the translation of this term. What the Buddha is always talking about is not the original creation of things, but the identified-with existence of things. Form has existence only in so far as it is experienced by an individual. That does not mean that the individual is creating form. It only means that the individual has created the experience of form. 'It is the diversity of data that results in the diversity of perceptions; it is not the diversity of perceptions that results in the diversity of data. <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.14.008.olds.bd.htm">SN 2.14.8 - olds</a></p>

						<p>The Buddha points out that form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness were unstable in the past, will be unstable the future and are unstable in the present and that therefore the wise person practices to let these things go.<br />
						Note the order: Past, Future, Present. This is the order used throughout the suttas (in spite of some translations indicating otherwise). The reason is to be found in the understanding of the nature of mind to proceed according to instructions. Think of the way a search tool looks for what is saught as literally described. [First examine the past, then examine the future, then examine the present.] We do not want it dwelling in the past or anticipating the future, so we direct the mind to reflection on the way things were in the past, then the way things will be in the future, then set it down to reflect on the way things are in the present. Also note that there is no actual term in Pali for 'the present'. Here it is <i>Paccuppanna</i> 'that which confronts' or has risen up in our face, literally the 'percussively-uprisen'. Elsewhere it is <i>'diṭṭha-dhamma'</i> this 'seen thing'. The reason? Change is seen to make it impossible to locate any point in time that could be called a 'present moment'. Even in that which confronts us different objects are changing at different rates and further, by the nature of perception being consequent on contact giving rise to consciousness, all that which we understand to be 'the present' is really already in the past.</p>

					<h4>I.III. Bhāra Vagga, III.25</h4>

						<p class="in1"><b>[<a id="p22">22</a>] <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.022.pali.bd.htm">Bhāra Suttaɱ,</a> III.25</b></p>
						
						<p>The Buddha teaches that the five stockpiles (khandha: body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness) amount to a burden, that the asumption of individuality can be termed the grasping of the burden, that desire for experience through the senses, desire to be, and the desire for more being, un-being, or re-being is the lifting up of the burden, and that the laying down of the burden is the utter eradication of desire.<br />
						This sutta has sparked extra interest by the translators because of an assumption made by an early western commentator (as noted in a footnote on the Woodward translation) that where there is a grabing hold, taking up, and laying down, there must be a grabber, a take-holder, and a let-goer and that therefore this sutta proves that the Buddha taught the existence of a being outside the khandhas. This is the error of reading into what one reads what is not written into what one is reading. The Buddha did not teach the non-existence of the self, but neither did he teach the existence of the self. What he taught was the process that results in existence and that the problem with existence was the fact of its coming to an end, and this, and only this is what is taught in this sutta.<br />
						There is a problem for translators in translation of the term <i>'vibhava'</i>. VI = re, un, and 2: re-in the sense of doubling or increase; BHAVA = being, living, existing. Woodward assumes that any meaning other than 'un' for this word is a later development. I am not sure there is a good basis for that assumption. It is equally possible that Gotama chose that term precisely because of it's multiple meanings.</p>

						<p>The Buddha declares that he who takes delight in the form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness is not free from pain, but he who is free from such delight is free from pain.<br />
						How does this work? Delight is one step removed from sensation. Delight is not the arising of pleasant sensation, it is the indulging in the enjoyment of that sensation, and is therefore fuel for the furtherence of existence. The act of indulging in delight has as it's counterpart existence. By not indulging in delight upon the arising of pleasant sensation, there is no fuel with counterpart in existence.

						This sutta is a variation on the previous. The BJT Pali has it arranged such as to have the conclusion applied to each of the five initial statements. If this were the case it should be applied to the previous sutta as well. However if such an arragement were correct it would amount to saying that by correctly seeing any single one of the khandhas, one could attain arahantship. This is not to say that this is not a possibility, as there is some support for this notion in that it can be argued that for the thorough comprehension of one a thorough comprehension of them all is needed, thus it could be said that the goal was achieved through the one.<br />
						It might have been corrected in later versions, but my copy of the BJT Pali for this entire book contains a great number of errors of the copy and paste variety. It looks like it went through some sort of initial setup and then was forgotten.</p>

						<p class="in1"><b>[<a id="p48">48</a>] <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.048.pali.bd.htm">Khandhā Suttaɱ,</a> III.47</b></p>
						
						<p>The Buddha defines what he calls the stockpiles (khandha) and what he calls the fueled stockpiles (<i>upādānakkhandha</i>).<br />
						A very important distinction is made here between <i>khandha</i> and <i>upādānakkhandha</i>. It is not form, sense-experience, perception, the own-made, and consciousness themselves that are the fuel supporting existence and rebirth; it is the delight with, the obsession with the lust, anger and blindness associated with these things that is that fuel. The distinction is being made between that which is already done, or that which exists externally, and that which is being contemplated, the subject of obsession, lust, anger and blindness. Body as seen objectively and body as seen in conjunction with the idea 'my'. If one is going to use the translation 'grasping' or 'clinging' for 'upadana', then the translation of 'upadanakkhandha' would be 'grasped-after-form...' or 'clung-to-form.' Woodward here uses 'factor that has to do with grasping' which passes, elsewhere he has used 'grasping-heaps' which gives the wrong sense: the heap is not grasping! That's something out of a horror movie. Bhk. Bodhi has 'subject to clinging' and has used 'affected by clinging' both of which are misdirections: the idea is that it is clinging to, or grasping after or the fueling based on or connected with body, etc, that gives rise to existence; this is not pointing to a thing there that is a clinging-affected body or a body that has been subjected to clinging. ... or maybe it is. Body is something that has become by way of clinging. But then if this term is to stand for both the obsessing that arises based on body and the body that arises based on obsessing, the term to be found must reflect both sides of the picture.<br />
						The stockpiles are one of the ways in which the Buddha has broken into smaller units everything in existence. The distinction between the stockpiles and the fueled stockpiles is that the fueled stockpiles are, as the name indicates, stockpiles fueled by the corrupting influences of lust, existence and blindness. In other words they have become the objects of the intent to experience sense-pleasures, existence, or the product of some point of view. The distinction is very clearly drawn in this sutta, but is it correct to draw the conclusion that it is saying that the khandhas exist separately from individuality? Identifying with the khandhas, or one of them, or holding opinions about the self (as per the previous sutta) they are upadana-kkhandha; seen externally, objectively, they are just khandha. When the asavas have been destroyed in the living Arahant, the khandhas are seen to carry on for the remainder of the lifespan of the being who became arahant. Subsequent to the 'visible' death of the Arahant, the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness dhatu break apart, separate off and he makes no further khandhas the object of intent to experience sensory existence and <i>for him</i> without such intent, because he has destroyed the asavas, do not arise again. So from two perspectives (the living arahant, and the separation from body, etc. of the living being from the khandhas at death) we can see that there is a distinction between khandhas that are fueled and those that are no longer fueled, but we cannot say that there is any sustained or autonomous existence of the khandhas separate from individuality.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes the stockpiles (kandha) in detail and shows how they are to be analyzed according to the Four Truths.<br />
						Note here that sankhara (my 'own-making') is described in terms of intent (sancitana) making it very clear that this term is to be understood as a synonym for kamma. Here is the argument against relying on the commentary for understanding technical terms. There is no need for commentary. Every important term is defined by Gotama himself. What is needed is not consultation with the commentaries, it is thorough examination of the suttas. When you have mastered the suttas it is then sometimes interesting to cosult the commentaries for background stories. There I say is their real value.</p>

						The Pali title of this sutta is <i>'Sambuddho';</i> the full description of a Buddha is <i>'Sammā-sambuddha'.</i> An Arahant could be said to be Consummately (or Perfectly or fully) Awakened <i>(sammā-buddho)</i>.

						<p>The second discourse given by Gotama, the Buddha, to his first five disciples, on the subject of not-self. This discourse resulted in the five attaining arahantship.<br />See <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/idx_first_sutta_resources.htm">First Sutta Resources</a> for the full story.<br />
						This is the basic reasoning behind the idea of not-self and follows logically from the doctrines laid out in the first sutta on the idea that the seeker should not go down either the path of self-indulgence or the path of self denial; seeing that that which has become is subject to ending; seeing that ending is a word for Pain; seeing that the source of this pain is thirst; that the way to end the pain is to end the thirst; and the way to end the thirst is to understand, to conform one's behavior, and to make real the peramaters outlined by the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way.<br />
						The Mendis translation also has a description of the events surrounding this sutta and an exposition of his understanding of the whole doctrine, but has two flaws: he speaks of 'No Self' in his discussion (which is an extreme view and an incorrect understanding of 'anatta') but has it correctly as 'not-self' in his translation; and he says that the disciples had insight into 'the impermanence of anything which had a conditioned origin' — another case of the misunderstanding that arises from the mis-translation of <i>saŋkhārā</i> (own-making see: <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbana Conditioned</a>, discussion).

						The Buddha explains that the bhikkhus have entered 'the lowest profession', that of scrap (or 'chunk', or 'glob' or 'mess') (see <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.096.pali.bd.htm#p14">SN 3.22.96</a> where it is used for a tiny 'bit' or 'lump' of dung) hunters, not from want of a livlihood or fears, but because it is in this way that some way out of all the pain in the world may be found.||<br />
						Although the term here is not 'bhikkhu' (beggar), but 'pindola' scrap hunter, or 'dole-man', someone on the dole, the spirit is the same. Many of the 'monks' of today object strenuously to being called 'beggars' and have completely missed the point: It is by adopting the lowest of callings that pride of birth is humbled and by showing those who are beggars as a consequence of their bad kamma, that such a life can be lived with ease, generosity, virtue and dignity it teaches the way out of their misery. The translation of 'bhikkhu' as 'monk' and of 'pindola' as 'almsman' or 'mendacant' whitewashes the truth and destroys the lesson.<br />
						This sutta is also interesting in that it records a feat of magic power in which the bhikkhus are lead to believe they are appearing before the Buddha singly or in pairs though they are all addressed simultaneously.</p>

						<p>Venerable Assaji is suffering an illness which prevents him from attaining jhana and he is worried about falling away. The Buddha explains to him that the essence of his teaching is not the attaining of jhana, and he instructs him in such a way as to bring about Assaji's arahantship.<br />
						There is some problem here with the identification of this Assaji with the Assaji who renounced the world with Gotama and who was the first teacher of Sāriputta. That Assaji would almost certainly have been called here 'Assaji Thera', where this Assaji is called '<i>āyasmā</i> Assaji, 'Elder'. Either this is the mistake or there is a far more serious error in that 'Assaji Thera' was supposed to have attained arahantship during the second discourse (<a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p59"><i>Pañca Suttam</i></a>) and this Assaji still has doubts and must be instructed concerning inconstance, pain and not self.</p>

						<p>A dialogue between Venerable Khema and a group of elder bhikkhus concerning identification with the five fuel stockpiles (khandhas).<br />
						This is a very instructive sutta told with a wonderful sense of humor. The very important thing to note here is Khema's explanation of how it can be that though one has thoroughly broken the idea of identification of self with the khandhas, there can remain a subtle inclination towards this identification.<br />
						"Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, still, in relation to the five aggregates subject to clinging, there lingers in him a residual conceit 'I am,' a desire 'I am,' an underlying tendency 'I am' that has not yet been uprooted."<br />
						There is a difference between being convinced that there is no thing there that is the self and actually seeing what is there as not-self.<br />

Wisdom is having vision <i>plus</i> having knowledge of the ways that vision is best used in a broad scope of applications. The better translation is closer to Bhk.

						<p>The Buddha defines the Dhamma Teacher, the one who lives the Dhamma following the Dhamma, and the one who has won Nibbana in terms of teaching about, following, and being released from shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness.<br />
						There appears to me to be some confusion between this and the previous sutta. In the first the only question asked is what makes a Dhamma teacher but three questions are answered. In the second three questions are asked which correspond to the answers given in both suttas. Further complicating the issue Woodward makes the second question in the second sutta ask about teaching about living the Dhamma following the Dhamma, which is not being asked and does not correspond to the answer. It seems the first sutta should have asked only the first question and been given only the first answer, and the second sutta which asks all three questions should follow (without Woodward's interjection of 'is one a teacher of').</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness as glowing embers.<br />
						The controversy mentioned in this sutta is a tempest in a teapot which eminates from one side ridgidly holding the position that everything is painful, not acknowledging transitory pleasures as being nevertheless pleasures; while the other side refuses to see that seen from the point of view of the ultimate result this is a legitimate position. Pleasure in this world is an observable fact, it is also observable that it always ends in pain. Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of <i>'sankhārā'</i> as 'conditioned' rather than 'own-made' or, at least 'constructed' in <i>Pts. of Contr.</i> only serves to confuse the issue.<br />
						What is going on here is important to note. It is essentially the same problem as trying to understand the notion of 'not-self' versus 'no self'. The difference between the statement (or interpretation of a statement made by another) of an observable fact and the statement of an opinion. Either of the two statements, 'the all (the world, the khandhas, etc.) is painful' or 'there is pleasure in the all ...' are true as far as they go. It is when the idea jumps to the categorical "everything, all (not 'the all') is ..." that the statement has become opinion. And, since an opinion concerning 'all' would require of the opinion holder the knowledge of all things at all times which is not possible, such opinion crosses over into error.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes living the Dhamma of the Dhamma as living making much of weariness (having had enough of) of shape, sense-experience, perception own-making and sense-consciousness. So living he understands, understanding he is liberated.<br />
						Here we have the definition for the <i>'anudhamma'</i> in the compound <i>'dhamma-anudhamma'</i> (things-following after-the teachings; or forms following after the Teaching; or 'Doctrine-following forms' Dhamma-corolaries?). That is, it is along the lines of 'following the Form of the Teaching', 'walking it like you talk it'. Woodward notes: 'conformity to rule,' Bhk. Bodhi: 'what accords with the Dhamma.'</p>

						This sutta does not appear in PTS Pali or in Woodward's translation. This is very probably an error. It does occur in the BJT Pali (although with an error that looks like it was an after-thought) and in the CSCD Pali used by the Bhk. Bodhi Wisdom Publications ed. and it belongs here by the logic of the usual construction of this series. Both have been constructed here following the pattern of the previous sutta. To avoid renumbering or having duplicate sutta numbers 'a' has been appended to the previous sutta number for this sutta.</p>

						Note: Sutta numbers for the Wisdom Publication edition and the BJT and CSCD Pali from this point to the end of this chapter are off by 1.<br />
						The PTS naming of Īs 146-148 seem to me to need rethinking. Bhk. Bodhi has: 'Engrossed in Revulsion', Contemplating Impermanence ... Suffering ... Nonself' which is more logical. To retain the PTS 'by the clansman' (and all of these suttas from 137 on should really be 'by way of ...') they should be: 'By the clansman: aversion; ... impermanence ... suffering ... no soul.'</p>

						Once again we have this very curious saying. Woodward doubts his own translation. I suggest the doubt that arises is a consequence of the possibility of this saying being heard in the original in multiple meanings according to context. "If I had not held such a thing to be mine in the past, it would not be mine now, if I do not hold such a thing to be mine in the present it will not become mine in the future." Substitute 'this pleasurable thing' for 'such a thing'; then substitute 'this painful thing' for 'such a thing' and reflect on the change in attitude that results.</p>

						'Micchā' should not be being translated 'wrong'. It is not 'wrong' it is 'mis'-something; mis-taken, mis-guided, mis-ccha ... . In the same way <i>'sammā'</i> should not be being translated 'right' although in that case there is etymological justification. The idea is not of right and wrong as we understand it, it is of 'the best way' versus all other ways. You say 'right' and that makes all other ways 'wrong' and you have set yourself in opposition to the world. The object is not to be in opposition to the world. It is to not be in opposition to or in favor of anything in the world. <i>'Sammā diṭṭhi'</i> is the 'consummate', 'correct', 'upright' course for those who'se aim is to escape pain. 'Micchā' is 'low' or 'misguided,' 'mistaken', etc.</p>
