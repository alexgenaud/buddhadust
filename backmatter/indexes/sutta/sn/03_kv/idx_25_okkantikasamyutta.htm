						<p>The Buddha first lays out the doctrine of the inconstance of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, and then states that any one who moderately approves of this doctrine is called a Streamwinner by faith, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one has a certain amount of insight into this doctrine one is called one who is a Streamwinner by <i>Dhamma,</i> one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one sees these things as they are, one is called a Streamwinner.</p>

						<p>The Buddha first lays out the doctrine of the inconstance of sights, sounds, scents, savours, touches and things (objects of the mind), and then states that anyone who moderately approves of this doctrine is called a Streamwinner by faith, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one has a certain amount of insight into this doctrine one is called one who is a Streamwinner by <i>Dhamma,</i> one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one sees these things as they are, one is called a Streamwinner.<br />
						There are two poor translations by Woodward in this sutta which the reader should keep in mind: He translates <i>'rūpa'</i> as body, but what is being spoken of here are the objects of the senses and that would be 'visible objects' 'sights,' not just the body. <i>Rūpa</i> is basically 'light', and it can be said that at its most fundamental sight is the perception of light.<br />
						'States of Mind' for <i>'Dhammā'.</i> The term must mean an object of the mind sense <i>(mano),</i> not a state of the heart <i>(citta).</i> 'Things.' 'Phenomena.' It cannot be 'The <i>Dhamma</i>' as the use pre-dates the appearance of such. 'Good Form' or 'Norm' is too narrow. The confusion may arise by the association with the fourth of the <i>Satipaṭṭhanas</i> where 'Living observing <i>Dhammas</i> in the The <i>Dhamma</i>' is described as observing the arising and passing away of several elements of The <i>Dhamma.</i> There is a general tendency among the translators to translate the Four <i>Satipaṭṭhanas</i> as though all four were aspects of the physical being (so the attempt to force <i>'dhammesu dhammānupassī'</i> into being the observation of all things mental and by that causing a conflict with the previous, <i>(citta)</i>) where what is being described is <i>'Dhammesu dhammānupassī'</i> 'observing the <i>Dhamma</i> in or through The <i>Dhamma</i>' making the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> a progression of observation from the body to sense experience to mental states to the abstract realm of The <i>Dhamma.</i> The object of the quest is to become like the Buddha: "<i>Dhamma</i> become." This is not a state downbound to the body or any form of the experience of existence through the senses including the mind as a sense.</p>

							<p>Woodward had, as even translators today have, the choice to changehis translations as he went along knowing how raggedy it looks, or not publishing at all which would be of benefit to no one ... maybe, depends on if the translation is really misleading. The alternative, to go back and alter all previous occurrences of a term, would stifle completion of even one book. Further, it is a wonderful phenomena with regard to this <i>Dhamma</i> that if the intent is to provide a true translation the word will likely be of benefit even when it is not quite the precise term that would yield the most insight or magic. This results in a picture of the evolution of understanding of the translator which may actually serve to benefit the serious reader who is likely to go through the same evolution himself even when faced with the most precisely true translation possible. In any case the work is so vast as to make inconsistencies unavoidable until the time when the whole work can be subjected to some kind of analysis that catches all the instances of a term throughout and substitutes the best translation, one that works in all cases. Work for the next generation of translators. "Talking my own position!"</p>

						<p>In this translation Woodward references a point of controversy which appears to be an argument arising from an understanding that <i>'~sañcetanā'</i> implies an intrinsic moral value within or attached to (<i>(sañ)</i>) sights, etc. The counter-argument points to <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.171.wood.pts.htm">AN 4.171.</a> where it is explained that <i>kamma</i> (good or bad action) is essentially defined by <i>'sañcetanā'</i> ('intent with regard to' or even possibly 'own-intent' 'identified-with intent'.) Woodward attempts to clarify the matter with his 'acts occasioned by'. Intent is an act <i>(kamma)</i> but this goes too far from the <i>Pāḷi.</i> The literal translation of <i>cetana</i> would be something like 'having the heart for' and this sutta does not go further than that into such things as acts of body related to sights etc. Again in this sutta Woodward speaks of 'body' where he should be speaking of 'sights' and in this sutta he has again switched his translation of <i>dhamma,</i> this time to 'ideas.'</p>

						The word to understand in this sutta is <i>Dhātu,</i> 'data', an informative characteristic of things or an element or aspect of their nature. We more commonly speak of these things in more abstract terms: solidity, liquidity, heat, motion, space and consciousness. Woodward has translated <i>'vāyo'</i> as 'air' which is not correct and precludes the ability to understand it as 'motion'. It is 'wave-form'. You can hear it in the term.</p>
