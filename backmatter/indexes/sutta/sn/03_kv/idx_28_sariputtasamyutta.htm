						<p>When Ananda remarks to Sariputta on how clear his aura appears Sariputta explains that he had spent the afternoon in the First Jhana and that entering, attaining or emerging therefrom there did not occur to him any thoughts of 'I-am'.<br />
						In this sutta is found an example of the term <i>'ahaŋkāra'</i> 'I-making'. I suggest this term allows for my 'own-making' for <i>'saŋkhāra',</i> and that understanding <i>'saŋkhāra',</i> to be translated in this way makes many things clear, including it's relationship to <i>'kamma,'</i> where if the word is translated as 'construction' it is needlessly redundant and confusing. <i>Kamma</i> is <i>saŋkhāra,</i> when the intent is to create experience of individuality.</p>

						<p>When Ananda remarks to Sariputta on how clear his aura appears Sariputta explains that he had spent the afternoon in the Fourth Jhana and that entering, attaining or emerging from the therefrom did not occur to him any thoughts of 'I-am'.<br />
						I object to the translation of 'Upekkhā' as 'Equanimity' used by Woodward and nearly every other translator. This is a term which must fit not only in the description of the Fourth <i>Jhāna,</i> where because the Fourth <i>Jhāna,</i> is still 'in this world' equanimity would be a possible fit, but it must also work where it is a synonym for Nibbāna and the experience of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleansant sensation ... in other words, <i>not</i> of the world. Equanimity is a term which describes a state of balance <i>'in the world'</i> and for that reason will not do. The term that will serve both situations is 'detachment'. And that is what the word is telling you it means: 'UP PASS K-KHA'. Look it up. 'Up passed' is not 'balanced between' the two sides (pleasant and painful) of experience, it is the experience of neither of the two sides. For those who wish to develop <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#NIRUTTI">'nirutti',</a> ask then why is UPA spelled UPE? PEK. UP PASS PEKKHA KKHA. Up passed wishing and wanting stuff. Grip the index finger of your right hand with the fingers of your left hand and then pull your index finger out of the grip. Don't get discourged if you can't do it. Keep your pecker up! (Be of good cheer!) Pecker = an instrument, like a pick or a beak, used to peck away at what one wishes to have. Upekkha = Detachment.</p>

						<p>When Ananda remarks to Sariputta on how clear his aura appears Sariputta explains that he had spent the afternoon in the Sphere of Nothing's Had There and that entering, attaining or emerging therefrom there did not occur to him any thoughts of 'I-am'.<br />
						I suggest this 'realm' is mistranslated 'nothingness'. <i>'Ākiñcaññā'</i> should be understood as a term describing lack of possession. It's not that there is nothing there, it is that there is nothing there which can be or which is possessed, owned, had. To say 'There is nothing' is to hold a wrong view. PED definately brings out the idea of ownership: "From the frequent context in the older texts it has assumed the moral implication of something that sticks or adheres to the character of a man, and which he must get rid of, if he wants to attain to a higher moral condition." In entering these states one is not inclined to great verbosity, so the statement made upon entering here <i>"n'atthi kiñcī"</i> 'There is not a smidgen', needs to be heard from the point of view of the meditator striving ever after more and more refined states, or in this case, states ever more free from 'things' to which one is attached.<br />
						Thinking that any thing that cannot be 'had' (seen, heard, smelt, tasted, or touched) we might translate this term as 'The Sphere Where Nothing's Real'.</p>
