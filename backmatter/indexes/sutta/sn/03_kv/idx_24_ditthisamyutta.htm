						<p>The Buddha states that the view that there is no such thing as kamma and it's results arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind.<br />
						The full statement of the view is (Bhk. Bodhi's translation, for comparison; see also <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#fn32">DN 2 (Rhys Davids)</a>:<br />
						<i>"There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing presented in charity; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously; no ascetics and brahmins faring and practising rightly in the world who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others. This person consists of the four great elements. When one dies, earth returns to and merges with the earth-body; water returns to and merges with the water-body; fire returns to and merges with the fire-body; air returns to and merges with the air-body; the faculties are transferred to space. [Four] men with the bier as fifth carry away the corpse. The funeral orations last as far as the charnel ground; the bones whiten; burnt offerings end with ashes. Giving is a doctrine of fools. When anyone asserts the doctrine that there is [giving and the like], it is empty, false prattle. Fools and the wise are alike cut off and perish with the breakup of the body; after death they do not exist."</i><br />
						At least here today [USA Monday, February 09, 2015 6:21 AM] the popular belief has not gone as far as to deny the existence of mothers and fathers, and Giving is still a much valued if often abused and misdirected practice.<br />
						This view is often stated as the belief that 'there is not,' and is what is often cited when the term <i>'micchā-ditthi'</i> (mistaken views) is used.</p>
						      
						      <p class="f4 in2">PTS: <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.24.005.wood.pts.htm">There is Not,</a> III.166<br />

						<p>The Buddha states that the view that there is no such thing as good and evil deeds arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind.<br />
						The view of <a href="../../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/purana-kassapa.htm">Pūraṇa Kassapa,</a> on the ineffectiveness of action in the production of consequences.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi's translation of this view:<br />
						<i>"When one acts or makes others act, when one mutilates or makes others mutilate, when one tortures or makes others inflict torture, when one inflicts sorrow or makes others inflict sorrow, when one oppresses or makes others inflict oppression, when one intimidates or makes others inflict intimidation, when one destroys life, takes what is not given, breks into houses, plunders wealth, commits burglary, ambushes highways, seduces another's wife, utters falsehood  — no evil is done by the doer. If, with a razor-rimmed wheel, one were to make the living beings of this earth into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh, because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing and slaughtering, mutilating and making others mutilate, torturning and making others inflict torture, because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making others give gifts, making offerings and making others make offerings, because of this there would be no merit and no outcome of merit. By giving, by taming oneself, by self-control, by speaking truth, there is no merit and no outcome of merit."</i><br />
						These views are not the products of simple-minded fools. They are arrived at at a point in deep meditative trances where the atomic nature of things is seen and the conclusion is reached that there is no individuality or even reality to anything and that the world is in fact a static illusion.</p>

						<p>The Buddha states that the view that there is no such thing as driving forces and their results (kamma) arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind.<br />
						Bhk. Bodhi's translation of this view:<br />
						<i>"There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition. There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition [There is no action by self, no action by others, no manly action.] There is no power, no energy, no manly strength, no manly endurance. All beings, all living beings, all creatures, all souls are without mastery, power, and energy; moulded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes."</i><br />
						Note here Woodward translates <i>'hetu'</i> (usually 'cause', but literally 'driving force' as in the force used by the driver to get the ox to move the cart along) as 'condion' and <i>'paccaya'</i> (usually 'condition', but better as 'result', or 'repercussion') as 'cause'.</p>

						<p class="in1"><b><a id="p8">8.</a> <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.24.008.pali.bd.htm">Mahā Diṭṭhi Suttaɱ,</a> III.211</b></p>
						
						<p>The Buddha states that the view that the elements are neither made nor caused to be made, that there is no such thing as kamma, and that the world is an illusion arising from a static reality arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind.<br />
						A long, mad, rambling point of view similar to the previous two proposed by Pakudha Kaccāyana and expounded by <a href="../../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/makkhali_gosala.htm">Makkhali of the Cow-pen.</a><br />
						Note: Woodward here translates <i>'diṭṭhi'</i> as heresy. This is not a correct translation, but is an interpretation put on the word when used of certain views. From the Buddhist perspective all views are essentially incorrect. <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (right view, or, better, consummate or high view) is 'high' or 'consummate' only in so far as it serves the goal. Similarly one must understand <i>'sammā diṭṭhi'</i> as a view from the perspective of its goal or it becomes at least partially incorrect.<br />
						Again perceptions giving rise to views of the sort found in the last three suttas can be encountered by any meditator. The world is seen as arising images, then vibrating atoms and then even the vibration stops as well and it is very easy to conclude that there is no existing as a living being and that therefore there is no doing evil or good deeds as it is just illusions passing through illusions. It is for this reason that a thorough understanding that kamma is action based on intent is so important. Real or not, intentional acts produce subjectively experienced results, and that is as good as saying that the consensus reality must be respected and dealt with as it is subjectively experienced by the ordinary common man and that being the case the view that 'it exists' cannot be rationally denied even when it cannot be rationally aserted.</p>

						Bhk.

					I justify this abridgment (and the two others below which follow the same pattern) where not abridging the suttas has been a policy here because these suttas are not the usual form of repetition as found in a wheel where there is always a small change made in each sutta, but are verbatim repetitions of the previous suttas.

					<p>This group is identical to the previous group. I have just duplicated the previous file and changed the numbers and title. It is not at all clear to me why this group is included. The scheme is complete as: I:19-36 = repetition of 1-18; i: 37-44 (originals); II:45-70: repetition of 1-18 + 37-44. Otherwise the more balanced scheme would be: I:1-18; i: 37-44; II: 1-18 + 37-44, or, if the point really is repetition: I:1-18; i:repetition of 1-18; II: 37-44; IV:repetition of 37-44; IV: repetition of 1-18 + 37-44.</p>
