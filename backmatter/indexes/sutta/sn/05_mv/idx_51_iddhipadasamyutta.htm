						<p>In a sutta reminiscent of the second sutta, Gotama relates that when he pondered the need to understand and cultivate the four paths and when he had cultivated them, knowledge and insight and wisdom were the result. The Pali in both PTS and BJT versions of this sutta is confused and incomplete (not just abbreviated) and has been corrected and spelled out completely in this version.</p>

						<p>The Buddha tells Ananda that one who had cultivated the four paths to magic power could live out the remainder of the kalpa. He then tells him he has cultivated the paths. But Ananda does not take the hint and ask the Buddha to live out the remainder of the kalpa. The Buddha then renounces the remainder of his lifespan and states that he will die in three months time.<br />

						<p>The Buddha describes his approach to developing magic powers and the various magic powers that he attained as a result of this practice.

						<p>Maha Moggallāna rouses up a bunch of slacker bhikkhus by using his big toe to distort and jiggle the house of Migara's mother, where they were residing.<br />
						However magical it might seem for Moggallāna to have created an earthquake-like disturbance with his big toe, that would be to miss the real picture conveyed by the Pali which is much more instructive as to the the way magic powers are actually performed. Picture the house immitating, as a house might, the boasting and braging, joke telling and various impropper behaviors of the bhikkhus. It is that sort of thing which cause the hair to stand on end. This is one of two occasions where Moggallāna causes such disturbance with his big toe. Both are very popular suttas.</p>

						<p>Venerable Ananda explains how the four paths to magic power use desire to bring about the end of desire.<br />
						A question that frequently comes up among beginners bound up in logic.<br />
						Interesting in this sutta is the difficulty of sustaining the translation 'investigation' for <i>'vīɱansā.'</i> The difficulty is getting a construction in English that is identical for all four. I see I have used 'investigation' in my translation here but I retain a pre-disposition to use the more literal 're-membering', but I prefer even more the idea of 'reminiscing', that is remembering with emotion. That is that in accomplishing any desire there is the reconstruction in mind by way of memory of the steps needed to attain that desire connected with desire to re-experience.<br />
						Also of interest is the discussion in Woodward's <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.51.015.wood.pts.htm#fn2">footnote on chanda</a> where I would dispute that in this Dhamma there is any moral issue involved in the term or any distinction being made between a moral and an un-moral sort of desire. Without disputing that there is a difference, all desire is on a level in this system, including the desire for attaining Arahantship. The desire for attaining Arahantship is the desire for attaining that arahantship for some sort of self. It's like trying to lift yourself by your bootstraps. Can't be done.</p>

						<p>Ananda asks the Buddha if he is able to reach the Brahma realm in the physical body as well as in the mental body and is told that he is able to do so and explains how. In this sutta we get the method for the Magic Power known today as 'shape-shifting'. <i>Vikubbanā-iddhi,</i> 'the power of transformation'. In this example it is the power to visit the brahma world in this body. This sutta is also interesting from the point of view of the fact that it is one of the few instances where Gotama is asked directly about his mastery of magic powers and specifically about one which is always at the top of the list of doubts by skeptics: the ability to do magic deeds in this body — the only state considered 'real' by the skeptic.</p>
