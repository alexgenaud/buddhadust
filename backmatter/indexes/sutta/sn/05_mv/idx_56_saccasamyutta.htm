						Important in the phrasing of this statement is, of course, that this is the case when home-leaving is done with the highest intentions. Given that, what is being said is that this is the real goal of all well-intentioned seekers.</p>

						<p>The Buddha states that whatever seekers and Brahmins there are, past, future, or present, who declare that they have been or will be awakened to things the way they are, do so by declaring that they have done so by way of deep comprehension of the Four Truths.<br />
						Another way of saying this is that in whatever words an awakened one uses to state that he is an awakened one and whatever words he uses to state that such and such was his method of doing so it amounts to saying that he has awakened to the Four Truths and has done so by deep comprehension of the Four Truths. The corollary of this is that it is very important to figure out the equivalence of the various ways understanding Arahantship is described and the equivalence of the various methods described for reaching Arahantship. Exercise: See if you can see the equivalence of the Four Truths and the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>.

						<p>The <i>bhikkhus</i> are urged to abandon thoughts of lust, deviance and harm and to train the mind to think 'this is pain', 'this is the source of pain', 'this is way to end pain,' 'this is the way to go about bringing an end to pain.'</p>

						<p>The <i>bhikkhus</i> are urged to abandon speculations concerning the world and the hereafter and to focus in stead on heart-felt comprehension of the thoughts: 'this is pain', 'this is the source of pain', 'this is way to end pain,' 'this is the way to go about bringing an end to pain.'<br />
						<i>Cintā</i> 'Heart-talk'. This is the form of thinking wherein one uses one's 'feeling' about what one is thinking about to push forward that thinking to the point of satisfaction. As long as one has the thought: 'This doesn't feel right,' one continues to reason out the issue. So it is not pure reason nor simple reflection nor just construction of ideas in words. As the Buddha points out, this is not in all cases a very reliable form of thinking. It works well in the case of the Four Truths because of the broadly edifying nature of the Four Truths relative to liberation.<br />
						Note that <i>'Tathāgata'</i> here means anyone who has got the goal.</p>

						<p>The Buddha gives a detailed definition of each of the Four Truths.<br />
						A very important sutta! The details, the meaning to be understood by the brief headings 'This is pain' etc. are not frequently found in the suttas. This is not the most detailed to be found but is a good start. For a more detailed set of definitions see the fourth section of the <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22"><i>Satipaṭṭhana Suttanta</i></a> of the <i>Dīgha Nikaya.</i> Remember, however, that pushed to its widest extent the Four Truths encompasses the whole of the <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
						Note that the definition of the first truth as being the five stockpiles of fuel <i>(upādāna-k-khandha)</i> is the equivalent of saying 'everything that constitutes existence is pain'.</p>

						<p>The Buddha gives a detailed definition of each of the Four Truths.<br />
						The difference between this sutta and the previous one is that here the definition of pain is the six personal or internal realms or spheres. Woodward: 'personal spheres of sense"; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: Internal Sense Bases. The simple statement that pain is to be understood as the six internal spheres should not be read as excluding the six external spheres. The very point of the sutta is to show the equivalence of the senses to the <i>(upādāna-k-khandha);</i> that is, everything in existence. (See on this the first several suttas of <a href="http://localhost/themozone/bd/backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm">The <i>Sal'ayatana Samyutta,</i></a> where both are called 'pain.' The fact is that 'the world, the origin of the world, the end of the world, is to be found in this fathom-long body' (and other such statements) indicates that that which is experienced as existence is essentially all internal. Another possibility is that the '<i>āyatana</i> of the eye' etc. was understood to mean both the eye and visual object, etc. When the components (eye: visual object) are used separately in SN 35 they are not accompanied by the term <i>'āyatana.'</i> A third possibility is that the term <i>'ajjhattikāni'</i> 'internal' was inserted later in error.</p>

						<p>The Buddha urges the <i>bhikkhus</i> to bear in mind the Four Aristocratic Truths.<br />
						A variation on the previous wherein the Buddha states that it would be impossible to reject these four truths and come up with another set of four truths and claim that they were spoken by the Buddha. These sorts of claims made by the Buddha are not infrequent and must be understood at a higher level. It is not that he is saying that some fool cannot come along and say this. What is being said is that an earnest, honest seeker, examining these four truths would need to see the truth of them before he could in good faith reject them and seeing the truth of them would not reject them let alone come up with a better way of expressing the truths therein, let alone claim that the Buddha did not say them. These truths provide the solution to the problem of pain in existence in the most fundamental, general, rock bottom way such that there is no more fundamental, general, or rock bottom way to state them. ... which is why very careful attention should be paid by translators to the translation of the term <a href="../../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dukkha.htm"><i>'dukkha'.</i></a> 'Stress' and 'Anguish' for example, are not all-encompassing of terms of pain and suffering. The term needs to encompass all those features that define <i>'dukkha'</i> in the various places it is defined (for example, SN 5.55.13 and 14, above, and the <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm"><i>Satipaṭṭhana Sutta</i></a>.) There are really only two words in English of such scope: the literal 'shit' (do-do uk ukky k-kha), and 'pain'. And the clincher, for 'pain' is the fact that in the definition found throughout the suttas of <i>dukkha</i> as: aging and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair, ('pain and misery' being the contrast between physical pain and mental pain,) the word which I have translated as 'pain,' that 'physical pain,' is <i>'dukkha'. Dukkha</i> needs to stand for physical pain and mental pain in the same way as does 'pain' in English.<br />
						There is another aspect to this. Middle-class American businessmen suffer 'stress'; upper class English women suffer 'anguish'. Other strata of society will reject out of hand that they suffer either stress or anguish. Virtually nobody in their right mind will reject the fact that they suffer pain. The compassionate term therefore, considering mankind in general, is the term accepted most universally: pain. If the translator feels the need to take in higher orders of existence, such as the gods, he will consider the term 'shit' to be more universally understood. 'pain' is really an abstract term; there is no concrete thing to point to explain it that will imply both mental and physical pain. I yield for the most part in my translations to the sensibilities of the modern reader of English and use 'pain' for my translation of <i>'dukkha',</i> but the literal meaning should be kept in mind when you come across the <i>devas</i> or face rebirth. Of course the even simpler way to handle this is to leave the term untranslated and add it to the English vocabulary. "<i>Dukkha</i> happens."</p>

						<p>Questioned about the meaning of the term <i>'avijja',</i> 'blindness', the Buddha explains that it is blindness to the truth of the four truths.<br />
						<i>Avijjā</i> is translated as 'ignorance' by Woodward and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi and almost all the other translators, but, unless you hear in this term 'Ignore-ance' understanding it to mean not that one is ignorant of a thing but that one is ignoring (refusing to acknowledge) one's knowledge of it, 'ignorance' is not the idea here. The idea here is precisely ignoring: 'not seeing' having penetrating knowledge and vision of, (<i>'vijja'</i> = 'vision'); understanding, seeing it as it really is, and not heeding one's vision.<br />
						If this were not the case anyone having once heard the four truths could be said to be without ignorance.<br />
						Make the connection: This is the first factor in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> the one ultimately dependent upon which is 'own-making' or constructing one's own personal world. So when that formula is encountered, it should be understood to be saying: "It is because of blindness to the four truths that one constructs one's own world."<br />
						The stream-enterer has knowledge and vision of the four truths and is therefore not ignorant, but for some time he may still go on constructing his own world. He does so out of blindness to, the ignoring of, the truth that whatsoever he constructs ends in pain.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes how one who understands the Four Aristocratic Truths does not rely on outward appearances for determining whether some person is one who knows and sees.<br />
						Be not mislead by 'the guru smile' and 'the guru radiance'. This appearance of great happiness is based on the love of fame and fortune. Watch, in stead for signs of lust, anger and blindness; knowledge of pain, its source, the way it is brought to an end, and the walk to walk to bring about its end. A teacher can project great power while having faulty understanding from a motive of anger at the world and seeing the <i>Dhamma</i> as a weapon against it.</p>

							<p><i>Vādin.</i> 'Professor'. In the old tradition of one who wanders around seeking truth by way of debating anyone who claimed to possess such. This is a lost art in most places in the world today [Saturday, November 07, 2015 8:08 AM] and that is a shame. This sort of debate used to exist even in this country. It was known as 'wrestling with the devil'. Among orthodox Jews such debate existed until very recently and may still exist. The debates often reached white heat and sometimes came to blows, but always ended with the understanding that the effort at bottom was to find the truth. The debate was separate from fellow-feeling. We are much at a disadvantage for the loss of this art. In our so-called 'forums' there is such fear of upsetting people's feelings (and thereby losing viewers and fame) that anything approaching true debate is cut off at the knees. What needs to be understood is that as long as debate is conducted according to <a href="../../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/come_beggar/cb_001.htm">rules that will always lead to higher understanding,</a> upset feelings are the consequence of hanging on to wrong ideas. Nothing personal. Let them go and be happy.</p>
