						A corrolary is that bhikkhus should be very careful in the way they toss around the term <i>'puthujjana'</i>, a very discouraging term for a layman to have directed at him. It is no easy thing to accomplish 'starting,' and beginners should be being encouraged rather than being made stepping stones for ignorant ego-building.</p>

						<p>The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that it is the degree to which they have mastered faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom that determines their having attained the various degrees of accomplisment in his system from Faith Follower to Arahant.<br />
						This version introduces the 'one-seed man' and the clan-to-clan-goer and introduces the idea of the streamwinner that has just seven lives more to go. The one-seed man is described as of a lower degree than the once-returner but is described by the commentary as being it's equivalent, that is that he has but one more life to go before becoming an Arahant. The distinction may be in the abode, where the one-seeder may be reborn in one of the deva worlds, where the once-returner is reborn once more in this world and becomes arahant here. The scale is apparently based on the time needed to achieve arahantship (the deva world being of vastly longer duration) (but this sounds very much like the non-returner to me; perhaps the distinction in this case is that the deva world is not in the Pure Abodes). The clan-to-clan goer takes rebirth in two or three families before becoming arahant. Considering all the various possibilities it appears that the only real constant is that once one has become streamwinner one is assured of attaining arahantship within seven rebirths. The variations can be anywhere between attaining arahantship in this life, or immediately subsequent to death, to traveling from realm to realm up to the highest Pure Abode, to taking an arbitrary number of rebiths up to seven more, either as human or deva. Pretty much any variation one could imagine.</p>

						The simile is that of a river divided by an island where from one perspecive it can be seen as two bodies of water and from another as a single body of water. The island is individuality. From the perspective of the individual the forces are objective energies that act on it while the powers are subjective uses of those forces; from an objective perspective they are one and the same thing.</p>

						<p>By developing and making a big thing of the Ariyan wisdom and freedom one can make an end and attain arahantship because the Ariyan wisdom is the force of wisdom and the Ariyan freedom is the force of serenity.<br />
						This sutta seems confused. It may depend on a much more pronounced understanding of 'Ariyan wisdom and freedom' than currently exists, but I suspect it is a confusion of two suttas or sets of suttas. First Gotama states that by two forces one may attain arahantship, then defines those two forces as the Ariyan wisdom and freedom, then states that these are the equivalant of the forces of wisdom and serenity. This sutta is in a group that looks like it should be an orderly progression: 1 force: wisdom; 2 forces: wisdom + serenity; 3 forces: wisdom + serenity + memory; 4 fources: wisdom + serenity + memory + energy; five forces: wisdom + serenity + memory + energy + faith. In stead we get this strangely mixed sutta for #2 and #3 is omitted altogether. Still, it does give us another example of the way we must remember that terms in this system overlap each other.</p>

						<p>An exposition of five forces (<a href="../../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm">indriya</a>): faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom and how one established in faith builds up stepwise useing these to attain insight overcoming all doubt as to the teacher or the doctrine. An important sutta for the understanding of the goal of satipatthana practice, and for the over-all goal. The goal of setting up sati is clearly stated to be: 'calling to mind and remembering things said long ago'. (other versions of this have it as 'said and done'; see: <a href="../../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.050.wood.pts.htm#p11">AN 10.50 Woodward § 11</a>). This when joined with tranquillity allows for such detachment as makes clear the perception "A world without end is the round of rebirth.' This is a recollection conjoined with a conclusion about what is remembered as it relates to its projection out into the future and to desire for things of the future. Otherwise stated as 'insight into the rise and fall of things.' At a certain point, recollecting and recollecting (as it is said in this sutta) one has made conscious enough various experiences to see that the idea that things come to an end is, without exception, a feature of everything that has come into existence and that this is not a desirable thing. In other words, a worldly goal is futile and painful. This is important to burn into one's consciousness! Try and imagine having lived forever and ever, having lived every variety of form of life times beyond counting. Try and form the idea of a boundless boredom and the dangers in attempting to escape this boredom in strange and unusual forms (usually ending in rebirth in Hell, e.g., being a Hitler) or the utter shame of discovering one has been hiding from the truth in mediocrity. Escape from the world, letting absoltuely everything in the world go, being entirely without worldly ambition is not what is generally taught about the practice of Buddhism but the objection is not that the practice of paying attention, or paying attention to the breathing will not produce clarity and strength of mind which can be put to good use in furthering worldly goals; the objection is to the making of the statement or the implying that this is the goal of Buddhism. It isn't.</p>

						<p>The Brahma Sahampati confirms the Buddha's thought that when the forces of faith, energy, memory, serenity, and wisdom are cultavated and made a big thing of they result in attaining Arahantship.<br />
						For students of the Pali language it should be interesting to note the way this Brahma is known: that is by his name being repeated twice. A name or word being repeated twice is understood to indicate an ultimate. 'Ladies and Gentlemen! The One and Only Brahma Sahampati!' 'Janusoni's white carriage, superb white carriage!'
