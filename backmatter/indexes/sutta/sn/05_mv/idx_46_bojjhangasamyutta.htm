						<p>The buddha teaches the bhikkhus about the diversions and the things that help in the development of the dimensions of awakening.<br />
						I have always found this sutta to be particularly obscure in that in several places it seems to be self-referential and uninformative. "What is the food of the memory-self-awakening dimension? Things based on the memory-self-awakening-dimension." I did my translation to see if there was something in the Pali that was being overlooked, but the picture is not much clearer. It isn't that this doesn't make sense, or cannot be figured out, it is just that it does not much advance the story which is unusual. (Hint: I suspect it of having been partly forgotten and made up after.) Other than in the places where this occurs this is a valuable sutta for it's detail concerning how to manage the diversions <i>(nivarana)</i> and how to develop the seven dimensions of self-awakening <i>(sambojjhanga)</i>.<br />
						Note: We can see in this sutta by the elaboration of 'dhamma-vicaya' that this is research into 'things', not research into 'The Dhamma.' Woodward's 'Norm'. I have also translated this 'The Dhamma' and also 'dhamma' and at this time I think I will not try to change what I have previously done as this points in any case to the ultimate goal of such research.</p>

						<p>The Buddha describes how even just the sight of an Arahant can lead to Awakening or non-returning.<br />
						The translations of both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi are easy to misunderstand. They give the impression that the whole sequence from first seeing an Arahant to attaining the result is virtually instantaneous. "When a monk, so dwelling aloof, remembers and turns over in his mind the teaching of the Norm, it is then that the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness is established in that monk. When he cultivates the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness then it is that the monk's culture of it comes to perfection." etc. Bhk. Bodhi: "Dwelling thus withdrawn, one recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over. Whenever, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwelling thus withdrawn recollects that Dhamma and thinks it over, on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness is aroused by the bhikkhu; on that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness; on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness comes to fulfilment by development in the bhikkhu." The idea is that when he starts one thing he has at that same time also <i>started</i> the next thing, to fully develop the first thing the second thing must be fully developed; when the first thing has been fully developed the other things are at that time also fully developed. Development is a circular thing; a revolving evolving enveloping developing.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that neglecting the seven dimensions of awakening is neglecting the path to Awakening; undertaking the seven dimensions of awakening is undertaking the path to awakening.<br />
						The interesting thing about this little sutta is the fact that it refers to the seven dimensions of awakening as the <i>'ariyo maggo sammā dukkhakkhayagāmi;'</i> the Aristocratic consummate way to the end of pain'. Woodward here understands this to be a reference to the Eightfold Way and inserts 'Eightfold' which is not there. Bhk. Bodhi translates properly as 'the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering,' but makes no comment. Could the <i>'bojjhaŋgā'</i> have been the original "Magga"? Not according to the <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">'First Sutta'</a>. What is the explanation?  Woodward translates the same phrase correctly (as 'the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill') at <a href="../../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_51_iddhipadasamyutta.htm#p2">SN 5.51.2</a> where it refers to the Four Iddhipada. 'Ariyaa Magga' appears to be a term that could be broadly applied. That is, could it be applied to any 'path' that lead to Nibbāna.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that undertaking the seven dimensions of awakening leads to a singular inability to abide, dispassion, ending, calm, higher knowledge, self-awakening, Nibbana.<br />
						The Dude would understand: its 'abide' in the sense of live with, not in the sense of 'tolerate'. Singular, Unique, Utter world-weariness: <i>ekanta-Nibbida:</i> one-ended-dis-abidability &gt; <i>vindati</i> = to find or to know (as in 'I found that to be ~" &gt; 'It was my pleasure to know" &gt; possess, enjoy, so dis-enjoy &gt; singularly unenjoyable). Woodward: 'downright revulsion'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'utter revulsion'. The problem with 'revulsion' is the implication that it is an emotion within. What is being spoken of is a perception that a thing out there is revolting. Like water rolling off a duck's back, the duck is not 'wetted' by the water. Dis-taste. Having no inclination to indulge. Having the idea, perception or knowledge, but not the sensation, that a thing is revolting.</p>

						<p>The Buddha teaches the Venerable Udayi that which destroys thirst and the way to practice to destroy thirst.<br />
						Woodward has complicated this sutta by inserting the qualification, per his understanding, of the remarks made by the Commentator, of 'rooted in craving.' Where the Pali says: <i>'Taṇhāya pahānā kammam pahīyati. Kammassa pahānā dukkham pahīyati.</i> 'Letting go Thirst, kamma is let go. Kamma having been let go, pain is let go,' he has "By the abandoning of craving action (that is rooted in craving) is abandoned. By the abandoning of action (rooted in craving) Ill is abandoned." Which he justifies with the statement: "To say that action as such should be abandoned would be contrary to the Buddha's 'doctrine of the deed.'"<br />
						This is a misunderstanding. The Pali does not say 'let go kamma', it says 'let go thirst'. The 'doctrine of the deed' is the view that kamma is a fact, that there are consequences that follow intentional acts. The view that there is no action necessary to become free from pain is 'the doctrine of non-action". To free one's self from pain it is necessary to act in a way which ends kamma which is the intentional action of not acting in response to <i>taṇhā.</i> It is kamma which ends kamma and thus is not 'non-action.' The end result is the end of kamma.</p>

						<p>Not tracing things back to their place of origin allows for wanting, deviance, lazy ways and inertia, fear and anxiety and doubt and vascillation to arise and when such arises it proliferates; but when one traces things back to their place of origin the seven dimensions of awakening arise and when such have arisen they roll on to complete development.<br />
						The PTS Pali and the Woodward translation have this as two suttas. This is clearly wrong as separate, the first would have no reference to the dimensions of awakening which is the theme of this chapter. They are combined here as one sutta but for clarity in referencing I have retained the numbering.<br />
						I did my translation because to me the sutta reads 'tracing or not tracing things back to their point of origin, this arises, because it has arisen it is the source of further development.' Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi read this as 'tracing or not tracing things such and such arises and goes on to further development.' I think they have not traced things to their place of origin, but it can be read both ways.</p>

						The message of the striking image of the destructive powers of the small seed if allowed to grow is that even the person who has given up the world to become a homeless bhikkhu, if he still has even small traces of his former diversions and does not take measures to eliminate them is in great danger just because of the growth of mind made possible by the homeless life.

						<p>The Buddha states that whatever shaman or brahman in the past, future or present has or will abandon the notions 'better am I', 'equal am I', 'worse am I,' all did or will do so by making a big thing of the seven dimensions of awakening.<br />
						This is not some liberal meat-head coccamami commi pinko, egalatarian construction of an ideal mental state among beings: "we are all equals here!". It involves two perceptions: the first is the perception that there is no thing there that is the self not only of one's own, but of anyone; the second is that there being no self there of anyone in anything, there is no difference between any of it's elements in terms of self-importance and to hold that there is is an indication that one is not yet seeing things as they are, and hence is a 'conceit' as Woodward puts it. Bhikkhu Bodhi calls such a notion a 'discrimination,' thinking, presumably of the negative use of that word, but the situation here is not 'discriminating against or in favor of'. It is certainly reasonable within the context of seeking awakening for example, to discriminate between levels of accomplishment: that the Buddha's understanding is superior to, or that one's degree of awakening is inferior to or equal to those in the various stages. It is where notions of the self as <i>having</i> or <i>possessing</i> such or lacking such attainment accompanied by pride or shame or the idea of 'better' or 'worse' enter the picture that such notions become problematic. Otherwise the perception would be as detached as the cook's perception as to the donness of a loaf of bread in the oven: it's not a matter of better or worse, superior or inferior, but of having reached a certain point of development. Even the idea 'better for mankind' 'better for the world' is a value judgment placed over an opinion as to the existence of the world which depends on notion of self-in-existence.</p>

						<p>The buddha explains the meaning of the expression: 'No pauper!' as being a person who has cultivated the seven dimensions of awakening.<br />
						This is the negative <i>(a-)</i> of the term used in the previous sutta and is really 'non-pauper', but we have the expression 'He is no pauper' which fits here very well. 'Pauper' would probably be the best term to use there if it were not lacking in the element of wandering around. My feeling is that generally the better translation in these cases is to use the same term in both the positive and negative as this will most clearly support the closeness of the translation to the original. On the other hand the student should make himself aware that when two different terms are used for the positive and the negative, there is likely some divergence from the original intent in one or the other or both of the terms used. I suggest that the divergence here (the element of wandering around) is symbolic: One without the seven dimensions of awakening wanders around poor in understanding, one who possesses the seven dimensions of awakening does not wander around mentally and is wealthy in spirit.</p>

If you can find no one you can be friendly with that appears to you to be intent on the good, then walk alone, 'like the bull elephant in the jungle keeping shy of the herd'. The whole issue of your being here in existence in the world is for the sake of companionship. If you cannot make that into an experience of the highest order, then the next most valuable thing you should do is cultivate the ability to tolerate loneliness. In any case the basis of companionship of the highest order is the mutual cultivation of detachment built on the appreciation of solitude. This is what should be understood as what is meant by 'the good'. That is, that it is ultimately not something to be sought for in persons, but in mental attitude. If one's companion is the appreciation of solitude, how can one ever be alone?</p>

						One of the most informative descriptions of the use of the Four Brahma-viharas. Here it is shown how it is to be used in conjunction with the seven dimensions of awakening. Also given are the results in each of the four of the practice when it falls short of complete freedom in Arahantship.<br />
						It is a wide-spread practice today [Wednesday, March 05, 2014 6:39 AM] to teach 'loving kindness' without the other three Brahma Viharas and with little or no reference to the other important doctrines of the system. Here it is made clear that however much this is a beneficial practice, it's final result is limited. One should not rest contented at this level! Here is a method for going deeper.<br />
						The BJT Pali text beginning at §12 where the Brahma-viharas are linked to the Sambojjhangas, is completely unrelated to this sutta as found in the PTS Pali, the CSCD or the Pali text used by Bhk. Bodhi.</p>

						<p>Developing perception of the skeleton produces great fruit, great benefits, either arahantship or non-returning, omniscience, psychic attainments, destruction of yokes, being greatly moved, and pleasant living in the present.<br />
						Woodward calls this 'the idea of the skeleton', Bhk. Bodhi: 'the perception of a skeleton'. I suggest the so-called 'after image' of the skeleton (a vision of the image of a great huge skeleton reclining in the cosmos) does not require having seen a real skeleton. (In the long distant past we have seen enough of skeletons!) Further, the message of the sutta is not that the goal is this image, but that in perceiving the skeleton when accompanied by the seven dimensions of awakening, the inference should be drawn that 'This body of mine, too, is just like that, is constructed just like that, has not got beyond the fate of that,' and that seeing that, any desire for body, ambition with regard to body is let go. Again I suggest that this is the meaning of: 'Living in a body, one regards body as body.' That is that we see body as it is, a thing subject to ending.</p>

					<p><a id="note">Note:</a> There is confusion between versions in the following sub-chapters of this chapter. My reading is that the lot should follow the organization of SN 5.45 which is itself confused between versions but which I believe is properly straightened out in the version provided here.

					   <p class="in1">Grasping ... etc. ...</p>

					<p>PTS Pali and Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translations would break up sub-chapters IX-XIII into two sets (repeating the sub-chapter headings, creating sub-chapters XIV-XVIII each according to the following (I use 'X. Earnestness' because I do not understand how 'IX. Ganga Repetition' could be divided up and make sense*:</p>

					<p>X. Earnestness</p>

					   <p class="in1">Tathagata</p>

						      <p class="in2">i. Seclusion</p>

					<p>XV. Earnestness</p>

					   <p class="in1">Tathagata</p>

						      <p class="in2">ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</p>

					<p>... etc. ...</p>

					<p>which would create a different scheme for them than is found in SN 5.45 and not include the sub-sub heads 'Ending in the Deathless' and 'Ending in Nibbana'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">*All versions are abridged so there is no clue. I speculate that the version as found in SN 5.45 was the first and that it was elaborated on to create the subsequent chapters. If this was the case then my X in this chapter could have been expanded to include the four sub-sub-sections. In any event the confusion here should certainly be considered a place to look for clues as to the original organization.</p>
