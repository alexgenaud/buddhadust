						<p>Isidatta and Purana describe their affection for the Buddha and he praises their faith and generosity in a way that suggests to them that they are Streamwinners.<br />
						Both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi describe these two as 'chamberlains'. Woodward, in a footnote suggests 'equeries' which comes closer to how the duties of these two are described. They were in charge of maintenance and preparation for use and assisted in the actual mounting of the royal conveyances (horses, elephants, chariots). The actual term means 'chariot builder' which could be interpreted as 'in charge of conveyances.' They were close enough to the king (Passanadi) to sleep in his chamber on at least one occasion which is a possible justification for calling them chamberlains but in the description of the episode in which this happens it looks like it was specially contrived and not a usual procedure.</p>

						<p>The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that they should teach the four limbs of Streamwinning to their friends, kith and kin, for whom they feel kindness of heart, who have a mind to listen to them.<br />
						One needs to walk a fine line when teaching Dhamma. One must balance the certain knowledge that Dhamma would be of value to anyone with the understanding that to try and push understanding on someone will have adverse results. The simplest formula is to refrain from teaching except in response to questions or to clear signals of interest. It is permissable however, given sufficient perception of likely understanding, to initiate discussion. The main idea is to avoid any hint of external pressure and internal anxiety for fame and fortune. In this sutta the boarder is deliniated by the idea that one should teach where one has kindly feelings towards the other and where the other is one with a predisposition to listen carefully to what you have to say.</p>

						<p>The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that they should teach the four limbs of Streamwinning to their friends, kith and kin, for whom they feel kindness of heart, who have a mind to listen to them. Then he assures them that one with any one of the four limbs of Streamwinning is immune from rebirth as an animal, ghost, or in Hell.<br />
						Here the thing to note is the idea that each of the limbs of stremwinning encompasses the others.</p>

						<p>Maha Moggallāna visits the Gods of the Three and Thirty and praises the four limbs of Stream-winning.<br />
						Here we have an example of how the four limbs of Stream-winning should be taught. Note that there is no discussion of such things as the Four Truths or the Paticca Samuppada. The teaching is the simple statement that to have faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha and to have ethical behavior that is admired by the Aristocrats will result in rebirth in a godly realm. Implicit is the expectation that someone interested in such an outcome will investigate further. Question. And by that give scope to a response by a capable teacher.<br />
						You have to read the fine print in these contracts! Behavior not approved of by the Aristocrats constitutes lack of faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha. You need to understand the subtle differences between today's understanding of moral behavior as compared to that of the ethical conduct of the Buddha's Dhamma.

						A good sutta for those of us with, shall we say, some deficiencies in our practice. Still, the lowest possible criteria — being able to distinguish what is well said from what is not well said — is no easy matter and for effectiveness in attaining streamwinning (defined essentially as the certain and permanent escape from rebirth in hell, as a ghost or as an animal and eventual awakening) requires at least contact with the Dhamma, though it implies that having this ability and continually traveling on rejecting the badly said in favor of the well said one will eventually come upon Dhamma.</p>

						There is a habit among some bhikkhus weak themselves in knowledge of the Dhamma, eager for some indication of their superiority to the rest of the world, not adverse to insulting others to class anyone not an ordained bhikkhu as a <i>'puthujjana,'</i> 'commoner'. Here in this sutta we can see that this term is to be applied only to those with absolutely no belief in the Buddha or his system. Those who do have belief but whose knowledge and practice falls short are called <i>'ariyasāvako pamāda-vihārī'</i> 'disciples who live carelessly'. Just having heard the idea that there is such a thing as awakening is a huge step in the right direction, any sort of faith in the Buddha and his teachings as being the way to attain that awakening should be respected as such.</p>
