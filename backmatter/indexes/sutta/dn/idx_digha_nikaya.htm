					<h4><a id="p1">1.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm">Brahmajāla Suttanta,</a> I.1</h4>
					
					<p>A sutta which serves well as an introduction to the Buddhist Dhamma for the serious beginner. It goes into minute detail concerning ethical practices and what is considered by the Buddha as other points of view held by the world called 'the net of views' from which his Dhamma provides an escape.</p>

					<h4><a id="p2">2.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.02.pali.bd.htm">Sāmañña-Phala Suttanta,</a> I.47</h4>
					
					<p>King Ajātasattu of Magadha, after pointing out the advantages derived from their occupations by a long list of ordinary people in the world, asks whether the members of the Order, who have given up the world, derive any corresponding advantage, visible in this life, from theirs. The answer is a list of such advantages, arranged in an ascending scale of importance, each one mentioned being said to be better and sweeter than the one just before described.</p>

					<h4><a id="p3">3.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.03.pali.bd.htm">Ambaṭṭha Suttanta,</a> I.87</h4>
					
					<p>This is one of several Suttas which deal with the subject of caste. As regards his own Order, over which alone he had complete control, he ignores completely and absolutely all advantages or disadvantages arising from birth, occupation, and social status, and sweeps away all barriers and disabilities arising from the arbitrary rules of mere ceremonial or social impurity. On being questioned about the issue, the Buddhas position was first to point out the actual facts of life — how a prosperous member of any group would find members of the others to wait upon him and serve him. Then he points out how a wicked man in accordance with the doctrine of Karma acknowledged by all good men, will be reborn in some state of woe; and a good man in some state of bliss. Thirdly, a criminal, whatever his class would be equally subject to punishment for his crime. And lastly, a man, whatever his class, would, on joining the order, on becoming a religieux, receive equal respect and honour from the people.</p>

					<h4><a id="p4">4.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm">Soṇadaṇḍa Suttanta,</a> I.111</h4>
					
					<p>This Dialogue comes very appropriately immediately after the Ambaṭṭha. That dealt with the general question of pride of birth, or social position. This deals with the special question of what is the essential quality which makes a man a Brahman.</p>

					<h4><a id="p5">5.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.05.pali.bd.htm">Kūṭa-Danta Suttaɱ,</a> I.127</h4>
					
					<p>A sutta in which the Very Reverend Sir Goldstick Sharp-tooth, lord of the manor of Khanumata, — very keen on being sure that his 'soul' should be as comfortable in the next world as he was, now, in this, makes up his mind to secure that most desirable end by the murder of a number of his fellow creatures, or as he would put it, by celebrating a sacrifice. In order to make certain that not one of the technical detail should be done wrong, the intending sacrificer goes to the Samaṇa Gotama for advice about the modes of the ritual to be performed. The Buddha's answer is to tell him a wonderful legend of a King Wide-realm, and of the sacrifice he offered — truly the most extraordinary sacrifice imaginable.</p>

					<h4><a id="p6">6.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.06.pali.bd.htm">Mahāli Suttaɱ,</a> I.150</h4>
					
					<p>An extremely long sutta with massive repetition which has inspired no one to date to translate it in full. Here, with the Olds translation, it is translated in full. Fully linked section by section to the Rhys Davids translation and the Pali. The Rhys Davids translation has been expanded to include the sections included by reference, but does not include sections he himself elected to omit. The Pali is fully expanded with all repetitions and referenced inclusions and is formatted for clarity. The sutta might have some interest for those curious about the practice of magic powers. In this Sutta we have discussed first the question of the ability to see heavenly sights and hear heavenly sounds where the Buddha says that it is not for the sake of acquiring such powers that people join the Order under him, then he gradually leads the questioner on to Arahatship, as the aim, along the Eightfold Path.</p>

					<h4><a id="p7">7.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.07.pali.bd.htm">Jāliya Suttanta,</a> I.159</h4>
					
					<p>The Buddha raises the question — whether the soul and the body are the same. And in answer, he leads the discourse up to Arahatship. This Sutta having been incorporated, word for word, in the previous Sutta, the reader is referred to the translation given there.</p>

					<h4><a id="p8">8.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.08.pali.bd.htm">Kassapa	Sīhanāda Suttanta,</a> I.161</h4>
					
					<p>In this Sutta the Buddha, in conversation with a naked ascetic, explains his position as regards asceticism. When speaking on sacrifice to a sacrificial priest, on union with God to an adherent of the current theology, on Brahman claims to superior social rank to a proud Brahman, on mystic insight to a man who trusts in it, on the soul to one who believes in the soul theory, Gotama puts himself as far as possible in the mental position of the questioner. He attacks none of his cherished convictions. He accepts as the starting-point of his own exposition the desirability of the act or condition prized by his opponent - of the union with God, or of sacrifice, or of social rank, or of seeing heavenly sights, or of the soul theory, he adopts the phraseology of his questioner and then, partly by putting a new and higher meaning into the words; partly by an appeal to such ethical conceptions as are common ground between them; he gradually leads his opponent up to his conclusion. This is, of course, always Arahatship — that is the sweetest fruit of the life of a recluse, that is the best sacrifice, that the highest social rank, that the best means of seeing heavenly sights, and a more worthy object; and so on.</p>

					<h4><a id="p9">9.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.09.pali.bd.htm">Poṭṭhapāda Suttanta,</a> I.178</h4>
					
					<p>This Sutta, beginning with a discussion on the mystery of jhāna, passes over to the question of the doctrine of the impermanence of each and every condition, physical or mental; the absence of any abiding principle, any entity, any substance, any 'soul'. The issue dealt with here is the gradual change of mental conditions, of states of consciousness: and then, secondly, the point that personality, individuality is only a convenient expression in common use in the world, and therefore made use of also by the Tathagata, but only in such a manner that he is not led astray by its ambiguity, by its apparent implication of some permanent entity.</p>

					<p>Almost word for word the same as the Samanna-phala Sutta, the chief difference is that the states of mind enumerated in the Samanna-phala as fruits of the life of a recluse are here divided under the three heads of Sīla, Samādhi, and Paññā — Ethical conduct, Serenity, and Wisdom.</p>

					<p>A story of one of the Buddha's former births told to Ananda as the Buddha was dying to illustrate the meaninglessness of worldly things.<br />
					Rhys Davids finds this to be a fable reflecting an ancient sun worship. I suggest rather that it is a story about you. In our hearts we are all 'the Great King of Glory' and this is highly illustrative of the process of withdrawing from the world in terms of that inner self-image.</p>

					<p>The long version of the famous sutta in which the Buddha describes the setting up of the mind by way of understanding the origin, sustainance and ending of body, sense experience, mental states and the Dhamma. Possibly the most famous, certainly one of the most important of all the Buddhas Suttas. It is this sutta which is the basis for the wide-spread 'mindfulness' business which makes use of but the first of its instructions.</p>

					<p>Another suttanta delivered by Gotama towards the end of his life. We have a cross link in this sutta to the events described in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.012.horn.pts.htm">MN 12.</a> This sutta describes events leading up to the resignation of Sunakkhatta from the order. Sunakkhatta has complained that Gotama works no feats of magic for him nor does he tell him about the origins of the world. But Gotama tells of several events where he worked feats of magic right in front of Sunakkhatta which were acknowledged by him as feats of magic. Then he describes several ways theories of the origin of the world are arrived at. I find this one of the most humorous suttas in the entire collection. This puts me in the class of a schoolboy on holiday in the opinion of Rhys Davids. All things considered that is probably not an insult to me. There are, however, things in this sutta which are extraordinary and worthy of deep thought. The major problem in formatting the sutta was getting the quotation marks correctly. What is at work is a hypnotic technique which does one of two things: throws the listener right off track or raises such a state of concentration as allows virtual transportation to the events being described. That was the point: that is, to create belief in the listener by bringing him to the position of eye-witness. It does this on multiple levels within the range of the contemporary scene and then it juxtaposes all those with visions of the ancient past right back to the origins of the world cycle. It has quotations within stories within quotations within stories within stories with quotations. I have tried to make the sequences more apparent by the use of indentations as well as the progression of quotation marks. There is one passage which is left abridged as it is not clear how Rhys Davids would have translated it. He summarizes which is not helpful. The possibility exists that I have not got the quotation marks perfectly correctly.</p>

					<p>Gotama instructs a group of ascetics on the way to bring the ascetic practice to it's highest perfection. This is a rare case where the Buddha, even after making an heroic effort fails utterly. This is also a sutta which shows the absolutely vital role repetition plays in the suttas. This was a spell which was designed to bring a group of committed ascetics step-by-step to the topmost peak of <i>their</i> discipline with the intent of bringing them, <i>from that point, over to Gotama's system.</i> It worked as far as bringing the group to their highest development, but failed to bring them across. If you even just read this sutta and wake up at those points where you want to skip the repetition and make yourself conscious that it is exactly at these points where the sutta takes one into a higher dimension, then this sutta has the potential to deliver one a view of infinity. I would love to hear this one given by an old-time black broad-brim hat, fire and brimstone preacher man, circa 1770s (or even of today in some places in the S.E. USA). A real masterpiece.</p>

					<p>In this sutta the Buddha sets out his idea of conquest, and then as inculcating the observance of the Dhamma as the most important force for the material and moral progress of mankind.<br />
					An incredably long repetitous sutta not at all in the usual style of Gotama which nevertheless conveys a strong message as to the future. The sutta paints a stark picture of the grinding devolution and evolution of man consequent on his behavior with regard to pretty much universally accepted (and today disregarded) fundamental ethical standards: not taking by theft, not lying, not harming living beings, not being promiscuous, not drinking alcohols, respecting family, elders, leaders. Things we see around us everywhere today where the fact of their leading the people astray is incontestable and yet contested at every turn and defended nowhere. "In times past it was to those of good behavior that respect was paid and to whom people listened; in times to come it will be the course setters in disrespect and poor behavior to whom the people will listen." The consolation in this sutta is the additional lesson of the cyclicity of this phenomena. The world devolves and evolves, round and round.</p>

					<p>The sutta has three elements: a list of signs to be found on the body of one who is a 'maha-purissa' or 'great-man,' an exposition of the behaviors that resulted in it's acquisition and the consequences of possessing such qualities, and a poetic recapitulation of the prose exposition. There are those who take the descriptions of the signs literally and there are those who take the descriptions of the signs as strictly metaphorical. I suggest that the signs are actual physical attributes which are being given metaphorical descriptions and that the signs themselves are to stand for but are not direct metaphores for  supernatural powers — they are more like 'clues'. I have not 'broken the code' for all of them, but here and there in the rest of the suttas we come across clues to their meaning. To provide one example: the Great Man has a long tongue. In this sutta what we hear is that this is a result of blameless pleasant speech and results in a commanding voice that is pleasant to hear. Elsewhere however [<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/kd/snp/kd.snp.faus.sbe.htm#III.7">KD.snp.3.7</a>] we find out that this tongue is able touch both ears and cover the forehead, and in another place that there is a power of a Great Man known as the Dibbasota, the Devine Ear, which gives the possessor the power to hear both sounds, heavenly and man made, far and near understanding their meaning. I suggest this is the meaning of this attribute of a Great Man and consequently it cannot be taken in the strictly linear way of a metaphore for quality of speech.<br />
					As to the physical manifestation of these signs there is a state of mind where this physical world becomes very plastic and where this body is capable of willful distortion and that in this state the physical attribute could be projected (made visible or 'superimposed as a vision') such as to be seen just as described.<br />
					I have a further speculation: this is one of a few very strange suttas in the collection which look to me to have been of interest to Gotama himself primarily because of their ancient heritage.<br />

					<h4><a id="p34">34.</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.34.pali.bd.htm">Dasuttara Suttanta,</a> III 272</h4>
					
					<p>This sutta is very similar to DN 33 in that it is a catalog of various units of the Dhamma organized by way of the number of items in the unit. It becomes a form of mental gymnastics by imposing on the structure that it be limited to ten sets fit within 10 specific concepts: — so that section 1 is 10 units of one item each, each dealing with concepts 1-10; the second is 10 units of 2 items each, each dealing with concepts 1-10; on up to 10 units of 10 items each, each dealing with concepts 1-10.</p>
