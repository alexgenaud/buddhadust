					<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

					<p class="f4">Dr. I.B. (Isaline Blew) Horner (March 30, 1896 - April 25, 1981) was a leading scholar of <i>Pāḷi</i> literature, late president of the <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society (1959-1981) and recipient of the Order of the British Empire (1980).</p>

					<p class="f4">On March 30, 1896, Horner was born in Walthamstow in Essex, England.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cambridge years</p>

					<p class="f4">In 1917, at the University of Cambridge's women's college Newnham College, Horner was awarded the title of a B.A. in moral sciences.</p>

					<p class="f4">After her undergraduate studies, Horner remained at Newnham College, becoming in 1918 an assistant librarian and then, in 1920, acting librarian. In 1921, Horner traveled to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), India and Burma where she was first introduced to Buddhism, its literature and related languages. In 1923, Horner returned to England where she accepted a Fellowship at Newnham College and became its librarian. In 1928, she became the first Sarah Smithson Research Fellow in <i>Pāḷi</i> Studies. In 1930, she published her first book, Women Under Primitive Buddhism. In 1933, she edited her first volume of <i>Pāḷi</i> text, the third volume of the Papancasudani (Majjhima Nikaya commentary). In 1934, Horner was awarded the title of an M.A. from Cambridge. From 1939 to 1949, she served on Cambridge's Governing Body.</p>

					<p class="f4">From 1926 to 1959, Horner lived and traveled with her companion "Elsie," Dr. Eliza Marian Butler (1885-1959).</p>

					<p class="f4">Horner was a cousin of the British Theravada monk Ajahn Amaro.</p>

					<p class="f4">PTS years</p>

					<p class="f4">In 1936, due to Butler's accepting a position at Manchester University, Horner left Newnham to live in Manchester. There, Horner completed the fourth volume of the Papancasudani (published 1937). In 1938, she published the first volume of a translation of the Vinaya Pitaka. (She was to publish a translation of the last Vinaya Pitaka volume in 1966.)</p>

					<p class="f4">In 1942, Horner became the Honorary Secretary of the <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society (PTS). In 1943, in response to her parents' needs and greater PTS involvement, Horner moved to London where she lived until her death. In 1959, she became the Society's President and Honorary Treasurer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Honors</p>

					<p class="f4">In 1964, in recognition of her contributions to <i>Pāḷi</i> literature, Horner was awarded an honorary Ph.D by Ceylon University.</p>

					<p class="f4">In 1977, Horner received a second honorary Ph.D from Nava Nalanda Mahavihara.</p>

					<p class="f4">In 1980, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Horner the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her lifelong contribution to Buddhist literature.</p>
