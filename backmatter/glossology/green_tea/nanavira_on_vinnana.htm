					<p class="f4"><a id="p1">Consciousness</a> (<i>viññána</i>) can be thought of as the <i>presence</i> of a phenomenon, which consists of <i>náma</i> and <i>rúpa</i>. <i>Námarúpa</i> and <i>viññána</i> together constitute the phenomenon 'in person' — i.e. an <i>experience</i> (in German: <i>Erlebnis</i>). The phenomenon is the <i>support</i> (<i>árammana</i> — see first reference in <i>[c]</i> below) of consciousness, and all consciousness is consciousness <i>of</i> something (<i>viz</i>, of a phenomenon). Just as there cannot be <i>presence</i> without <i>something</i> that is present, so there cannot <i>be</i> something without its being to that extent <i>present</i> — thus <i>viññána</i> and <i>námarúpa</i> depend on each other (see A Note On Paticcasamuppáda §17). 'To be' and 'to be present' are the same thing. But note that 'being' as <i>bhava</i>, involves the existence of the (illusory) <i>subject</i>, and with cessation of the conceit (concept) '(I) am', <i>asmimána</i>, there is cessation of being, <i>bhavanirodha</i>. With the <i>arahat</i>, there is just <i>presence of the phenomenon</i> ('This is present'), instead of the presence (or existence) of an apparent 'subject' <i>to whom</i> there is present an 'object' ('I am, and this is present to [<i>or</i> for] me', i.e. [what appears to be] the subject is present ['I am'], the object is present ['this is'], and the object concerns or 'belongs to' the subject [the object is 'for me' or 'mine'] — see <i>Phassa</i> and <i>Attā</i>); and consciousness is then said to be <i>anidassana</i>, 'non-indicative' (i.e. not pointing to the presence of a 'subject'), or <i>niruddha</i>, 'ceased' (see A Note On Paticcasamuppáda §22). <i>Viññánanirodha</i> refers indifferently to <i>anidassana viññána</i> (<i>saupádisesa nibbánadhátu</i>, which refers to the living <i>arahat</i>: Itivuttaka II,ii,7 &lt;Iti.38&gt;[12]) and to cessation, at the <i>arahat</i>'s death, of all consciousness whatsoever (<i>anupádisesa nibbánadhátu</i>). <i>Viññánanirodha</i>, strictly speaking, is cessation of <i>viññán'upádánakkhandha</i> as <i>bhavanirodha</i> is cessation of <i>pañc'upádánakkhandhá</i> (i.e. <i>sakkáyanirodha</i>), but it is extended to cover the final cessation of <i>viññánakkhandha</i> (and therefore of <i>pañcakkhandhá</i>) at the breaking up of the <i>arahat</i>'s body.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2"></a>Consciousness, it must be noted, is emphatically no more 'subjective' than are the other four <i>upádánakkhandhá</i> (i.e. than <i>námarúpa</i>). (This should be clear from what has gone before; but it is a commonly held view that consciousness is essentially subjective, and a slight discussion will be in place.) It is quite wrong to regard <i>viññána</i> as the subject to whom the phenomenon (<i>námarúpa</i>), now regarded as object, is present (in which case we should have to say, with Sartre, that consciousness as subjectivity is <i>presence to</i> the object). <i>Viññána</i> is negative as regards essence (or 'what-ness'): it is not <i>part</i> of the phenomenon, of what is present, but is simply the presence of the phenomenon. Consequently, in visual experience (for example), <i>phenomena are seen, eye-consciousness is not seen</i> (being negative as regards essence), yet <i>there is eye-consciousness</i> (eye-consciousness is present <i>reflexively</i>). In this way consciousness comes to be associated with the body (<i>saviññánaka káya</i>), and is frequently identified as the subject, or at least as subjectivity (e.g. by Husserl [see <i>cetanā</i> [b]] and Sartre [<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 27]). (To follow this discussion reference should be made to phassa, particularly [c], where it is shown that there is a natural tendency for subjectivity to be associated with the body. Three distinct pairs of complementaries are thus seen to be superimposed: eye and forms (or, generally: six-based body and externals); consciousness and phenomena; subject and objects. To identify consciousness and the subject is only too easy. With attainment of <i>arahattá</i> all trace of the subject-and-objects duality vanishes. Cf. also attá [c].)</p>
