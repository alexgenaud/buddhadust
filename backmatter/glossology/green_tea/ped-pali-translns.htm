					<p class="f4"><b>Rhys Davids</b><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>From the Introduction:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">The problem put [in this sutta — where does the world come to an end?] is of great interest; and goes to the very core of the Buddhist <i>Welt-anschauung,</i> of Buddhist philosophy. <i>The world, as we know it, is within each of us.</i></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Verily, I declare to you, my friend, that within this very body, mortal as it is and only a fathom high, but conscious and endowed with mind, is, the world, and the waxing thereof, and the waning thereof, and the way that leads to the passing away thereof!</p>

					<p class="f4">On this Dr. Karl, Neumann, whose illustrations of Buddhist texts from passages in Western literature, old and new, are so happy, appropriately compares Schopenhauer's saying (W.W. V. I, 538), 'One can also say that Kant's teaching leads to the view that the beginning and end of the world are not to be sought without, but within us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The problem, as put by the <i>Bhikshu</i> to the gods, is: 'Where do the elements pass away?' The Buddha, in giving his solution, first says that that is not the right way to put the question. It ought to be: 'Where do the elements find no foothold; where does that union of qualities that make a person (nāma and rūpa) pass away?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The alteration is suggestive. The person should be introduced; a thinking being. We only know of the elements and their derivatives, as reflected in, constructed by, human intelligence. To the question, as thus altered, the answer is: 'They find no foothold in the mind of the Arahat, and when intellection (with special reference to the representative faculty) ceases, then they, and the person with them, cease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So in the Bāhiya story (Ud. I, 10) we are told:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'There, where earth, water, fire, and wind no footing find,<br />
					There are the nights not bright, nor suns resplendent,<br />
					No moon shines there, there is no darkness seen.<br />
					And then, when he, the Arahat hath, in his wisdom, seen;<br />
					From well and ill, from form and formless, is he freed!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>From the sutta:</b></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Now the question, brother, should not be put as you have put it. Instead of asking where the four great elements, cease, leaving no trace behind, you should have asked:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Where do earth, water, fire, and wind,<br />
					And long and short, and fine and coarse,<br />
					Pure and impure, no footing find?<br />
					Where is it that both name and form<br />
					Die out, leaving no trace behind?"</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'On that the answer is:<br />
					'The intellect of Arahatship, the invisible, the endless, accessible from every side</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Where is it that earth, water, fire, and wind,<br />
					And long and short, and fine and coarse,<br />
					Pure and impure, no footing find.<br />
					Where is it that both name and form<br />
					Die out, leaving, no trace behind.<br />
					When intellection ceases they all also cease.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Bhkkhu Thanissaro:</b><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"'Your question should not be phrased in this way: Where do these four great elements — the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property — cease without remainder? Instead, it should be phrased like this:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">Where do water, earth, fire, and wind</p>
							 <p class="f4 in2">have no footing?</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">Where are long and short,</p>
							 <p class="f4 in2">coarse and fine,<br />
							 fair and foul,<br />
							 name and form</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">brought to an end?</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">"'And the answer to that is:</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">Consciousness without feature,</p>
								  <p class="f4 in3">without end,</p>
							 <p class="f4 in2">luminous all around:</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">Here water, earth, fire, and wind</p>
							 <p class="f4 in2">have no footing.</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">Here long and short</p>
							 <p class="f4 in2">coarse and fine<br />
							 fair and foul<br />
							 name and form</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">are all brought to an end.</p>
						<p class="f4 in1">With the cessation of [the activity of] consciousness</p>
							 <p class="f4 in2">each is here brought to an end.'"</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>He footnotes:</b></p>

					<p class="f3 in2">1. <i>Viññanam anidassanam.</i> This term is nowhere explained in the Canon, although <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p49">MN 49</a> mentions that it "does not partake in the allness of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualesson6.htm#ALL">the All</a>" — the "All" meaning the six internal and six external sense media (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p23">SN XXXV.23</a>). In this it differs from the consciousness factor in dependent co-arising, which is defined in terms of the six sense media. Lying outside of time and space, it would also not come under the consciousness-aggregate, which covers all consciousness near and far; past, present, and future. However, the fact that it is outside of time and space — in a dimension where there is no here, there, or in between (Ud I.10), no coming, no going, or staying (Ud VIII.1) — means that it cannot be described as permanent or omnipresent, terms that have meaning only within space and time. The standard description of nibbana after death is, "All that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here." (See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.140.than.ati.htm">MN 140</a> and Iti 44.) Again, as "all" is defined as the sense media, this raises the question as to whether consciousness without feature is not covered by this "all." However, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p174">AN IV.174</a> warns that any speculation as to whether anything does or doesn't remain after the remainderless stopping of the six sense media is to "complicate non-complication," which gets in the way of attaining the non-complicated. Thus this is a question that is best put aside.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>The footnote:</b></p>

					<p class="f3 in2">"These lines (which also appear as part of a full verse at DN 11.85/i.223) have been a perennial challenge to Buddhist scholarship, and even Acariya Buddhaghosa seems to founder over them. MA takes the subject of the sentence to be <i>Nibbāna,</i> called "consciousness" in the sense that "it can be cognized." This obviously a contrived derivation, since nowhere in the Canon is Nibbana ever described as consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> MA offers three explanations of the phrase <i>sabbato pabhaṃ:</i> (1) completely possessed of splendour <i>(pabhā);</i> (2) possessing being <i>(pabhūtaṃ)</i> everywhere; and (3) a ford <i>(pabhaṃ)</i> accessible from all sides, <i>i.e.,</i> through any of the thirty-eight meditation objects. Only the first of these seems to have any linguistic legitimacy. Nm, in Ms, explains that he takes <i>pabhaṃ</i> to be a negative present participle of <i>pabhavati — apabhaṃ</i> — the negative-prefix <i>a</i> dropping off in conjunction with <i>sabbato</i>: "The sense can be paraphrased freely by 'not predicting being in relation to "all,"' or 'not assuming of "all" that is is or is not in an absolute sense.'"</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'I have said that cognition is the cause of name-and-form. Now in what way that is so, Ananda, is tobe understood after this manner. Were cognition not to descend into the mother's womb, would name-and-form become constituted therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'It would not, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Were cognition, after having descended into the mother's womb, to become extinct, would name-and-form come to birth in this state of being?'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'It would not, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Were cognition to be extirpated from one yet young, youth or maiden, would name-and-form attain to growth development, expansion?'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'It would not, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Wherefore, Ananda, just that is the ground, the basis, the genesis, the cause of name-and-form, to wit, cognition.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'I have said that name-and-form is the cause of cognition. Now in what way that is so, Ananda, is to be understood after this manner. Were cognition to gain no foothold in name-and-form, would there then, in the coming years, be manifested that concatenation of birth, oold age, death and the uprising of Ill?'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'There would not, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Wherefore, Ananda, just that is the ground, the basis, the genesis, the cause of cognition, to wit, name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'In so far only, Ananda, can one be born, or grow old, or die, or dissolve, or reappear, in so far only is there any process of verbal expresion, in so far only is there any process of explanation, in so far only is there any process of manifestation, in so far only is there any sphere of knowledge, in so far only do we go rond the round of life up to our appearance amid the conditions of  this world — in as far as this is, to wit, name-and-form together with cognition.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>And he has this footnote:</b><br />
					...Barely stated, the summary amounts to this: — 'Only through cognition, language and bodily form do we live and express ourselves.' The little paragraph contains a great part of modern psychology in the germ-state.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Rhys Davids view here is world-bound; but if you hear it with a more divine ear, it is a fair statement of the issue in that sense as well: To solve the problem of rebirth and pain we only need to take our analysis back to it's point of origin and since there is no way of expressing what is beyond that anyway (as this is also the point of origin of conceptual thought and speech) it is only this far that we can rationally press the issue. Where the Mahayanists and others make their error is in not letting the issue drop at this point.]</p>

					<h4 class="ctr g"><a id="evola">Destruction of the Demon of Dialectics</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Excerpt from <b>The Doctrine of Awakening</b><br />
					by Julius Evola<br />
					translated from the Italian by H.E. Musson (AKA <a href="../../../backmatter/gallery/nanavira.htm"><i>Bhikkhu</i> Nanavira</a>)<br />
					<a href="http://www.parkstpress.com/">Inner Traditions</a>, Rochester, 1996</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Note: Included here because it concisely puts together and properly frames a number of citations from the suttas that relate to this issue ... and, okok, gives me a chance to shoot off about Julius Evola! ... Julius Evola, one of Hitler's primary inspirations, was, to my reading, at the time of the writing of this book simply deeply concerned about the degeneration of man that he saw all around him.</p>

					<p class="ctr"><b>Destruction of the Demon of Dialectics</b></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The premise from which the Buddhist Doctrine of Awakening starts is the destruction of the demon of dialectics; the renunciation of the various constructions of thought and speculation, which are simply an expression of opinion, and of the profusion of theories, which are projections of a fundamental restlessness in which a mind that has not yet found in itself its own principle seeks for support.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">This applies not only to cosmological speculation, but also to problems concerned with man, his nature and destiny, and even to any conceptual determination of the ultimate aim of asceticism. "Have I ever existed in past epochs? Or have I never existed? What was I in past epochs? And how did I come to be what I was? Shall I exist in future epochs? Or shall I not exist? What shall I be in future epochs? And how shall I become what I shall be?" And even the present fills [the common man] with doubts: "Do I indeed exist? Or do I not exist? What am I? And how am I? This being here, whence has it really come? And whither will it go?" All these for Buddhism are but "vain thoughts": "This is called the blind alley of opinions, the gorge of opinions, the bramble of opinions, the thicket of  opinions, the net of opinions," caught up and lost in which "the ignorant worldling cannot free himself from birth, decay and death." [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p2">MN.2.38</a>] And again: "'I am' is an opinion; 'I am this' is an opinion; 'I shall be' is an opinion; 'I shall not be' is an opinion; 'I shall be in the worlds of [pure] form' is an opinion; 'I shall be in the worlds free from form' is an opinion; conscious nor unconscious, I shall be' is an opinion. Opinion, O disciples, is a disease; opinion is a tumor; opinion is a sore. He who has overcome all opinion, O disciples, is called a saint, one who knows." (ibid., 140)</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">It is the same with the cosmological order: "'The world is eternal' 'The world is not eternal.' 'The world is finite.' 'The world is infinite.' 'The life-principle and the body are the same.' 'The life-principle is  one thing, the body another.' 'The Accomplished One is after death.' 'The Accomplished One is not after death.' 'The accomplished One both is and is not after death.' 'The Accomplished One neither is nor is not after death' — this is a blind alley of opinions, a thicket of opinions, a wood of opinions, a tangle of opinions, a labyrinth of opinions, painful, desparate, tortuous, not leading to detachment, not leading to progress, not leading to vision, not leading to awakening, not leading to extinction." (ibid, 72) The doctrine of the Accomplished Ones is described as that which "destroys to the foundations every attachment to and satisfaction in false theories, dogmas and systems" and which therefore cuts off both fear and hope. (ibid 22) The reply to the question asked of the Buddha: "Perhaps Lord Gotama [this is the Prince Siddhattha's family name] has some opinion?" is categorical: "Opinion: that is remote from the Accomplished One. The Accomplished One has seen." (ibid 72)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Interestingly just after I put in this quote, I came across the same quote by Bhikkhu Thanissaro that just happens to footnote the very issue of <i>"Viññanam Anidassanam.":</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><b><i>Aṇguttara Nikaya</i></b> I.49-52<br />
					<i>Pabhassara Sutt</i>a<br />
					Luminous<br />
					Translated from the <i>Pāḷi</i> by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements." {I,v,9}<br />
					"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements." {I,v,10}<br />
					"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements. The uninstructed run-of-the-mill person doesn't discern that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — there is no development of the mind." {I,vi,1}<br />
					"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — there is development of the mind." {I,vi,2}</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><b>Note</b><br />
					1. This statement has engendered a great deal of controversy over the centuries. The commentary maintains that "mind" here refers to the <i>bhavanga-citta,</i> the momentary mental state between periods when the mental stream adverts to objects, but this statement raises more questions than it answers. There is no reference to the <i>bhavanga-citta</i> or the mental stream in any of the suttas (they appear first in an <i><b>Abhidhamma</b></i> treatise, the Patthana); and because the commentaries compare the <i>bhavanga-citta</i> to deep sleep, why is it called luminous? And why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mind? And further, if "mind" in this discourse means <i>bhavanga-citta,</i> what would it mean to develop the <i>bhavanga-citta</i>?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Another interpretation equates the luminosity of the mind with the "consciousness without feature," desribed as "luminous" in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p49">MN 49</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p11">DN 11,</a> but this interpretation also has problems. According to MN 49, that consciousness partakes of nothing in the describable world, not even the "Allness of the All," so how could it possibly be defiled? And, because it is not realized until the goal of the practice is reached, why would the perception of its luminosity be a prerequisite for developing the mind? And again, if "mind" here means consciousness without feature, how could the sutta talk of its development?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">A more reasonable approach to understanding the statement can be derived from taking it in context: the luminous mind is the mind that the meditator is trying to develop. To perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed, aversion, or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature, are not a necessary part of awareness. Without this understanding, it would be impossible to practice. With this understanding, however, one can make an effort to cut away existing defilements, leaving the mind in the stage that <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p24">MN 24</a> calls "purity in terms of mind." This would correspond to the luminous level of concentration described in the standard simile for the fourth <i>jhāna:</i> "And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — he enters and remains in the fourth <i>jhāna:</i> purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness." From this state it is possible to develop the discernment that not only cuts away existing defilements but also uproots any potential for them to ever arise again. Only in the stages of Awakening that follow on those acts of discernment would "consciousness without feature" be realized.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I have found audio recordings of <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro DhammaTalks at: <a href="http://www.audiodharma.org/">http://www.audiodharma.org/</a> (Scroll down the list of speakers on the left-hand margin; and for one that specifically mentions <i>"Viññanam Anidassanam"</i> listen to #ll on the Five Aggregates.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Another note on this term is provided by <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro at <b><i>Majjhima Nikaya</i></b> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.109.than.ati.htm">109 <i>Mahā-Puṇṇama Sutta</i></a><br />
					The Great Full-moon Night Discourse:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"To what extent does the designation 'aggregate' apply to the aggregates?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Monk, whatever form is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of form.<br />
					Whatever feeling is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of feeling.<br />
					Whatever perception is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of perception.<br />
					Whatever own-makings are past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: those are called the aggregate of own-making.<br />
					Whatever consciousness is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="btfn1" href="#btn1">bt1</a>]</sup></span> This is the extent to which the term 'aggregate' applies to the aggregates."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="btn1" href="#btfn1">bt1</a>]</sup> One form of consciousness apparently does not come under the aggregate of consciousness. This is termed <i>viññanam anidassanam</i> — consciousness without a surface, or consciousness without feature. <a href="#mn49">MN 49</a> says specifically that this consciousness does not partake of the "allness of the all," the "all" being conterminous with the five aggregates. The standard definition of the aggregate of consciousness states that this aggregate includes all consciousness, "past, present, or future ... near or far." However, because <i>viññanam anidassanam </i>stands outside of space and time it would not be covered by these terms. Similarly, where <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.097.than.ati.htm">SN XXII.97</a> says that no consciousness is eternal, "eternal" is a concept that applies only within the dimension of time, and thus would not apply to this form of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> A clue here as to a possible reason for much confusion about this issue. This is not a discussion of <i>Nibbāna.</i> This is a discussion of the consciousness of the Arhahant, that is, the consciousness that is aware of <i>Nibbāna.</i> For this situation I use an exercise: Stand in front of a grill that has a lit flame (or a fire, etc). Then ask yourself: "Would I willingly thrust my hand into that flame?" Of course not. Why not? Because you are not ignorant of the consequences. Then direct your attention to the knowing that as a consequence of not thrusting your hand in the flame, you will not experience pain. The non-experience of pain that results from not being blind to the consequences and not having any residue of doubt as to the matter and the behavior that is appropriate to such an understanding is <i>Nibbāna.</i> The consciousness of the non-experience of pain is <i>Viññāṇā Anidassana.</i> The one perceives the other. Imagine a baloon. What we experience as life is like seeing the baloon from the inside. Then imagine that someone is turning the bloon inside out. We still see the same inside of the baloon, but we are on the outside. <i>Nibbāna</i> is freedom from the things of the world downbound to pain. <i>Vñāṇā Anidassana</i> is the knowing of that. It is the knowing of a thing that isn't there; since it is not tied to an object, it cannot be said to have come to be, it cannot cease to be if it never came to be, and it cannot cause pain if it cannot cease to be. In the forumulas for Arahantship, most have as a precondition not only that one becomes free, but that one knows one is free.</p>
