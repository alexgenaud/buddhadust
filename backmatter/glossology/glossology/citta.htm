									<p><b>Citta: </b>[Sk. citta, orig. pp. of cinteti, cit...]</p>

									<p>I. Meaning: the heart (psychologically), i. e. the centre &amp; focus of man's emotional nature as well as that intellectual element which inheres in &amp; accompanies its manifestations; i. e. thought. In this wise citta denotes both the agent &amp; that which is enacted...for in Indian Psychology citta is the seat &amp; organ of thought...</p>

									<p>The meaning of citta is best understood when explaining it by expressions familiar to us, as: with all my heart; heart and soul; I have no heart to do it; blessed are the pure in heart; singleness of heart (cp. ekagga); all of which emphasize the emotional &amp; conative side or "thought" more than its mental &amp; rational side...It may therefore be rendered by intention, impulse, design; mood, disposition, state of mind, reaction to impressions. It is only in later scholastic lgg. that we are justified in applying the term "thought" in its technical sense. It needs to be pointed out, as complementary to this view, that citta nearly always occurs in the singular (=heart), &amp; out of 150 cases in the Nikāyas only 3 times in the plural (=thoughts). The substantiality of citta (cetas) is also evident from its connection with kamma (heart as source of action), kāma &amp; the senses in general...</p>

									<p>Citta in it's relation to other terms referring to mental processes.</p>

									<p>1. citta-hadya, the heart as incorporating man's personality: hadayaŋ phaleyya, cittavikkhepaŋ papuṇeyya (break his heart, upset his reason) S I.126; . . . S I.207, 214; Sn p. 32; . . .</p>

									<p>2. c. as mental status, contrasted to (a) physical status: e. g. kilanta* weary in body &amp; mind D I.20=III.32; ātura* S III.2-5; nikaṭṭha* A II.137; ṭhita* steadfast in body &amp; soul (cp. ṭhitatta) S V.74; *passaddhi quiet of body &amp; soul S V.66. . . .</p>

									<p>(a) active=intention, contrasted or compared with: (a) will, c. as one of the four samādhis, viz. chanda, viriya, c., vimaŋsa D III.77; S V.268; Vbh 288. - (b) action, c. as the source of kamma: . . . "when the intention is evil, the deed is evil as well" A I.262; . . . - Esp. in contrast to kāya &amp; vācā, . . . (in deed &amp; speech &amp; will . . .</p>

									<p>(b) passive=mood, feelings, emotion, ranging with kāya &amp; paññā under the (3) bhāvanā D III.219; S IV.111; A III.106; cp.

S I.13 = 165; D III.269... As feeling citta is contrasted with intellection in the group saññā c. diṭṭhi A II.52...</p>

									<p>Citta in its range of semantical applications: (1) heart, will, intention, etc.</p>

									<p>(a) heart as general status of sensory-emotional being; its relation to the senses (indriyāni).
