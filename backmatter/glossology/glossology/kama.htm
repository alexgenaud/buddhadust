									<p><b>Kāma: </b>(paraphrase by "icchāyaṃ," cp. Vedic kāma, kam=Idg. *qā) to desire, cp. Lat. carus, Goth. hors, E whore. -- 1. Objective: pleasantness, pleasure-giving, an object of sensual enjoyment; -- 2. subjective: (a) enjoyment, pleasure on occasion of sense, (b) sense-desire.... 2. Kāma as sense-desire and enjoyment plus objects of the same is a collective name for all but the very higher or refined conditions of life. The kāma-bhava or -loka (worlds of sense desire) includes 4 of the 5 modes (ga' ti.) of existence and part of the fifth or deva-loka. See <a href="bhava.htm">Bhava</a>. The term is not found analyzed till the later books of the Canon are consulted, thus, Nd1 1 distinguishes (1) vatthukāmā: desires relating to a base, i. e. physical organ or external object, and (2) kilesakāmā: desire considered subjectively....A more logical definition is given by Dhammapāla on Vv 11 (VvA 11). He classifies as follows: 1. manāpiyā rūpādi-visayā. -- 2. chandarāga. -- 3. sabbasmiṃ lobha. -- 4. gāmadhamma. -- 5. hitacchanda. -- 6. serībhāva, i. e. k. concerned with (1) pleasant objects, (2) impulsive desire, (3) greed for anything, (4) sexual lust, (5) effort to do good, (6) self-determination.<br />
									In all enumerations of obstacles to perfection, or of general divisions and definitions of mental conditions, kāma occupies the leading position. It is the first of the five obstacles (<a href="nivarana.htm">nīvaraṇāni</a>), the three esanās (longings), the four <a href="upadana.htm">upādāna</a>s (attachments), the four oghas (floods of worldly turbulence), the four <a href="asavas.htm">āsavas</a> (intoxicants of mind), the three <a href="tanha.htm">taṇhā</a>s, the four yogas; and k. stands first on the list of the six factors of existence: kāmā, <a href="vedana.htm">vedanā</a>, <a href="sanna.htm">saññā</a>, <a href="asavas.htm">āsavā</a>, kamma, <a href="dukkha.htm">dukkha</a>, which are discussed at A III.410 sq. as regards their origin, difference, consequences, destruction and remedy.   Kāma is most frequently connected with rāga (passion), with <a href="chanda.htm">chanda</a> (impulse) and gedha (greed), all expressing the active, clinging, and impulsive character of desire.   The foll. is the list of synonyms given at various places for kāma-cchanda: (1) chanda, impulse; (2) rāga, excitement; (3) nandī, enjoyment; (4) taṇhā, thirst; (5) sineha, love; (6) pipāsā, thirst; (7) pari'āha, consuming passion; (8) gedha, greed; (9) mucchā, swoon, or confused state of mind; (10) ajjhosāna, hanging on, or attachment.... Similarly at D III.238: kāme avigata-rāga, -chanda, -pema, -pipāsa, -pari'āha, -taṇha. See also kāma-chanda below under cpds. In connection with synonyms it may be noticed that most of the verbs used in a kāma-context are verbs the primary meaning of which is "adhering to" or "grasping," hence, attachment; viz. esanā (is. to Lat ira), upādāna (upa + ā + dā taking up), taṇhā (tr.s., Lat. torreo=thirst) pipāsā (the wish to drink), sineha (snih, Lat. nix=melting), etc. -- On the other hand, the reaction of the passions on the subject is expressed by khajjati "to be eaten up"...Under this aspect kāma is essentially an evil, but to the popular view it is one of the indispensable attributes of bliss and happiness to be enjoyed as a reward of virtue in this world...as well as in the next ... -- Kāma as sensual pleasure finds its most marked application in the sphere of the sexual...transgressing in lusts, sinning in the lusts of the flesh, or violating the third rule of conduct...inchastity...<br />
									Redemption from kāma is to be effected by self-control (saṅyama) and meditation (<a href="jhana.htm">jhāna</a>), by <a href="nana.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="vayama.htm">right effort</a> and <a href="nekkhamma.htm">renunciation</a>....vivicc' eva kāmehi, aloof from sensuous joys is the prescription for all Jhāna-exercise.<br />
									Character of Kāmā. The pleasures of the senses are evanescent, transient (sabbe kāmā aniccā, etc. A II.177), and of no real taste (appāsādā); they do not give permanent satisfaction; the happiness which they yield is only a deception, or a dream, from which the dreamer awakens with sorrow and regret....S I.9, 117;...S I.22;...-- na kahāpaṇavassena titti kāmesu vijjati appasādā dukkhā kāmā iti viññāya paṇḍito "not for showers of coins is satisfaction to be found in pleasures...The misery of such pleasures is painted in vivid colours in the Buddha's discourse on pains of pleasures M I.85 and parallel passages..., how kāma is the cause of egoism, avarice, quarrels between kings, nations, families, how it leads to warfare, murder, lasciviousness, torture and madness...<br />
									Similes.... the pleasures of the senses are likened to: (1) aṭṭhi-kankhala, a chain of bones;   (2) maṃsapesi, a piece of (decaying) flesh; -- (3) tiṇ'ukkā, a torch of grass; (4) angāra-kāsu, a pit of glowing cinders; - (5) supina, a dream; (6) yācita, beggings; -- (7) rukkha-phala, the fruit of a tree; -- (8) asisūna, a slaughter-house; -- (9) satti-sūla, a sharp stake; -- (10) sappa-sira, a snake's head, i. e. the bite of a snake at Vin II.25; M I.130; A III.97...<br />

							<h4 class="ctr">The Similies</h4>

							<p class="f4">When trying to determine what is meant by the Buddha when using the term <i>kāmā</i> one should picture not a single state or class of states, but a spectrum of classes of states from the own-making (sankhara-ing) born of the yearning of the deluded Pajapati for the companionship of other beings, to common experience of [caring about] enjoyment of the sensations produced at the senses, to sexual intercourse. Visualize these images as superimposed over one-another. (A = B = C) It's not Freud's 'everything is just sex' and it's not 'ultimately everything is Pajapati's problem'. It depends on where your mind is at present. Start there. It's from there that detachment is possible. To help cultivate the mind to detachment from wherever it is focused, the Master has concocted (cooked up; sankhara'd) a number of similes: Pleasures of the Senses are:</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like A Bone thrown to a Dog</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a dog,<br />
							overcome with hunger and thirst<br />
							who chances upon a slaughter-<i>house</i><br />
							and the cattle-butcher,<br />
							or his skillful apprentice,<br />
							tosses him a bone,<br />
							scraped,<br />
							much-scraped,<br />
							devoid of meat,<br />
							but with a shmere of blood.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">Could that dog,<br />
							gnawing that bone,<br />
							scraped,<br />
							much-scraped,<br />
							devoid of meat,<br />
							but with a smere of blood<br />
							find in that<br />
							the satisfaction of his hunger and thirst?</p>

							<p class="f4">Of course not.</p>

							<p class="f4">How come?</p>

							<p class="f4">Because he would wear himself out<br />
							before ever he got satisfaction from that bone<br />
							scraped,<br />
							much-scraped,<br />
							devoid of meat,<br />
							but with a smere of blood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like Carrion</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagin a Raptor<br />
							— a Condor or Eagle or Falcon or Hawk —<br />
							that has torn off a piece of carrion<br />
							and flown off<br />
							and that other Raptors<br />
							— Condors or Eagles or Falcons or Hawks —<br />
							are circling round diving at that piece of meat<br />
							trying to grab a piece for themselves.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">If that Raptor<br />
							— that Condor or Eagle or Falcon or Hawk —<br />
							did not quickly let go of that piece of carrion,<br />
							would it not come to death,<br />
							or deady pain?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like Carrying a Torch against the Wind</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a man coming forth<br />
							carrying a flaming grass torch<br />
							against the wind.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">If that man did not quickly let go of that flaming grass torch<br />
							would it not burn his hand,<br />
							or burn his arm,<br />
							or burn another part of his body<br />
							and because of that<br />
							would he not come to death,<br />
							or deady pain?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like a Pit of Glowing Coals</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagin a pit of glowing coals,<br />
							deeper than a man is high<br />
							— coals neither flaming up nor smoking —<br />
							and here a certain person comes along,<br />
							loving life, not wishing death<br />
							wanting happiness, averse to pain<br />
							and two strapping men,<br />
							taking his arms<br />
							were to drag him off to that pit of glowing coals,<br />
							deeper than a man is high<br />
							— coals neither flaming up nor smoking.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">Would not that man<br />
							twist and turn his body<br />
							this way<br />
							and that thinking:</p>

							<p class="f4">'If I fall in<br />
							that pit of glowing coals<br />
							I will come to death,<br />
							or deady pain!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like a Dream</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine seeing beautiful parks,<br />
							and beautiful forests,<br />
							and beautiful plains,<br />
							and beautiful mountain ranges,<br />
							and beautiful lakes,<br />
							in a dream,<br />
							and then waking up<br />
							to find they have vanished.</p>

							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/zoot-a-lore.jpg" width="63" height="142" alt="snappy" /></p>
						</div>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like a Loan</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a man who has taken out a loan,<br />
							got himself rigged up with a new car,<br />
							right snappy duds,<br />
							rings, earrings, buttons and studs<br />
							a glitter with diamonds and rubies<br />
							and other precious gems,<br />
							gold and silver chains and medallions,<br />
							pockets stuffed with cash,<br />
							delighting in the admiration of the crowd<br />
							that thinks this is the way<br />
							a wealthy man struts his stuff.</p>

							<p class="f4">Then imagine that right there<br />
							the collector<br />
							or his skillful apprentice<br />
							comes along and repossesses the new car,<br />
							the new duds,<br />
							his jewels and his cash.</p>

							<p class="f4">Strips 'im right down to 'es boxers<br />
							right there in front of everyone.</p>

							<p class="f4">Then he has second thoughts ...<br />
							and takes the boxers too.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think about that?</p>

							<p class="f4">Would that man's embarassment<br />
							convince him<br />
							that he had had enough of pretending?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like Being Up A Tree</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a fruit tree<br />
							growing in the dense forest<br />
							laden with ripe fruit<br />
							but with no fruit yet fallen to the ground,<br />
							and here comes a certain person<br />
							hungry and thirsty for fruit<br />
							looking around for fruit,<br />
							with a wanna, needa gotta hafta hava<br />
							piece<br />
							of fruit.</p>

							<p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

							<p class="f4">Although this fruit tree is laden with fruit,<br />
							no fruit has yet fallen to the ground.</p>

							<p class="f4">But I know how to climb a tree —<br />
							How about if I climb this tree<br />
							and eat as much as I want<br />
							and stuff my pockets for later?</p>

							<p class="f4">And that is just what he does.</p>

							<p class="f4">Then imagine that<br />
							a certain man with an axe<br />
							comes along<br />
							hungry and thirsty for fruit<br />
							looking around for fruit,<br />
							with a wanna, needa gotta hafta hava<br />
							piece<br />
							of fruit.</p>

							<p class="f4">And seeing that tree, thinks:</p>

							<p class="f4">Although this fruit tree is laden with fruit,<br />
							no fruit has yet fallen to the ground<br />
							and I do not know how to climb a tree —<br />
							How about if I chop down this tree<br />
							and eat as much as I want<br />
							and stuff my pockets for later?</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">If that first man did not quickly climb down from that tree,<br />
							would he not come to death,<br />
							or deady pain?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4">In the same way as in these similes<br />
							Pleasures of the Senses<br />
							are of much grief and aggrivation at the time<br />
							and lead to real danger later.</p>

							<p class="f4">Seeing the meaning of these similes<br />
							as they really are<br />
							with consumate wisdom —<br />
							you avoid<br />
							whatsoever is that which is diversity-situated diversity detachment —<br />
							whatsoever is that which is unity-situated unity detachment —<br />
							and develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4">Diversity-situated diversity detachment is the detachment of an individual who is himself diverse in nature from that which is diverse in nature. What is diverse in nature is form, sensation, perception, own-making and individualized consciousness. Ordinary detachment: aka: Poise, equanimity, unflappability, detachment.</p>

							<p class="f4">Unity-situated unity detachment is the detachment of an individual who is himself unified in nature from that which is unified in nature. What is unified in nature is the four formless realms and the state of ending perception of sense-experience. Temporary Release. Delivery from things of Time.</p>

							<p class="f4">Detachment wherein all support for the world is completely desolved is Nibbana, the unseen consciousness, deathlessness, being outside Time. This is called "Release from things Not of Time," and is an unshakable, permanent freedom.</p>
