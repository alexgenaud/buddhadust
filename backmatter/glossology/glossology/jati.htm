									<p><b>Jāti: </b>[see janati and cp. Gr. genea/, ge/nesis; Lat. gens; Goth. kind-ins]. ...1. birth, rebirth, possibility of rebirth, "future life" as disposition to be born again, "former life" as cause of this life. Defined...D II.305 = S II.3... - Jāti is a condition precedent of age, sickness and death, and is fraught with sorrow, pain and disappointment. It is itself the final outcome of a kamma, resting on avijjā, performed in anterior births; and forms thus the concluding link in the chain of the Paṭicca-samuppāda. [MO: ?The concuding link is <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jaramarana.htm">jaramarana,</a> old age and death]... Various rebirths are seen by one who has perfect insight into all happening and remembers his former existences (D I.81; III.50; A I.164; M II.20). Arahantship implies the impossibility of a future rebirth...2. descent, race, rank, genealogy (cp. fuh/, genus), often combd w. gotta. Two grades of descent are enumd at Vin IV.6 as hīnā jāti (low birth), consisting of Candā'a, Veṇa, Nesāda, Rathakāra and Pukkusa; and ukkaṭṭhā j. (superior birth), comprising Khattiyas and Brāhmaṇas. - The var. meanings of jāti are given by Bdhgh at Vism 498, 499 in the foll. classification (with examples) bhava, nikāya, sankhata-lakkhaṇa, paṭisandhi, pasūti, kula, ariya-sīla....3. a sort of, kind of...four kinds of scent J I.265; II.291.   4. (jāti-) by (mere) birth or nature, natural (opp. artificial); or genuine, pure, excellent (opp. adulterated, inferior)...
									-thaddha conceited, proud of birth...
									-nirodha the extermination of (the cause of) rebirth...
									-sambhava the origin of birth A I.142; III.311; J I.168;
									-saŋsāra the cycle of transmigration, the saŋsāra of rebirths...: pahīna left behind, overcome (by an Arahant) M I.139; A III.84, 86;

					<h4><a id="existence">Existence</a></h4>

					<p><b>Buddhists Believe That The Human World</b> is not the only world where living beings exist, but that there are many other planes of existence where some forms of life flourish. These planes of existence, despite the fact that some are invisible to human eyes, are closely related to our world. They are places where rebirth takes place.</p>

					<p>According to Buddhism, the nature of one's future birth is conditioned by kamma. From here one may, after death, go "upwards" to the plane of happiness or "downwards" to the realm of misery.</p>

					<p>Viewed from the point of view of rebirth, the human world and other worlds or planes of existence are reciprocally related. Not only do the beings of this world pass away to take rebirth in other planes, but the beings of those planes also come to take rebirth in the human world.</p>

					<p>The Pali Canon speaks of three planes of existence called bhava. The Pali term <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/bhava.htm">bhava</a> literally means 'becoming', 'state of existence' or 'plane of existence'. The three planes of existence are: </p>

					<p class="lgqt">a. <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kama.htm">Kama</a>-bhava, the plane of desires,<br />
					b. <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/rupa.htm">Rupa</a>-bhava, the plane of form, and<br />
					c. Arupa-bhava, the plane of the formless or incorporeal beings.</p>

					<p>In the Sammaditthi Sutta<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup> the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Venerable Sariputta</a> speaks of the cause, the cessation and the path leading to the cessation of bhava for each and every individual. Attachment (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upadana.htm">upadana</a>) is described as the cause of bhava.  Because of attachment one is to be reborn again after death, and because he is to be reborn, bhava or the plane of existence is said to exist for him.</p>

					<p>The cessation of bhava is the cessation of attachment which is its cause. And <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm">the Noble Eightfold Path</a> is the way leading to the cessation of attachment.</p>

					<p><a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#ThePaliCannon">The Pali Canon</a> speaks of four types of birth in different planes of existence. The first type is that of a being born from an egg (andaja). Whatever being comes into life by breaking through an eggshell is called a 'being born from an egg'.</p>

					<p>The second type is that of a being born from a womb (jalabuja). The being born by breaking through a membranous sheath, like human beings, or some kinds of animals like cows, etc., belongs to this type of birth.</p>

					<p>The third type is that of the being born of moisture (sansedaja).  Whatever being is produced out of rotting fish or rotting corpses or in a dirty pool,' is called a 'being born of moisture'.</p>

					<p>The fourth type is that of spontaneous uprising (opapatika). Devas or gods in heaven, and those who are born in hell belong to this type of birth.</p>

					<p>We may roughly say that human beings belong to the second type of birth or jalabuja; among the beings in the animal kingdom, some belong to the first type of birth or andaja, some belong to the second type or jalabuja, and some belong to the third type or sansedaja; the beings in heaven and in hell belong to the fourth type or opapatika.</p>
