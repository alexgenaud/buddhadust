					<p class="f4"><b><a id="brahman">brahman (brahmin):</a></b> The brahman caste of India has long maintained that its members, by their birth, are worthy of the highest respect. Buddhism borrowed the term brahman to apply to those who have attained the goal, to show that respect is earned not by birth, race, or caste, but by spiritual attainment. Used in the Buddhist sense, this term is synonymous with <i><a href="#arahant">arahant</a></i>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="buddho">buddho:</a></b> Awake; enlightened. An epithet for the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Buddha">Buddha:</a></b> The name given to one who rediscovers for himself the liberating path of Dhamma, after a long period of its having been forgotten by the world. According to tradition, there is a long line of Buddhas stretching into the distant past. The most recent Buddha was born Siddhattha Gotama in India in the sixth century BCE. A well-educated and wealthy young man, he relinquished his family and his princely inheritance in the prime of his life to search for true freedom and an end to suffering <i>(<a href="#dukkha">dukkha</a>).</i> After seven years of austerities in the forest, he rediscovered the "middle way" and achieved his goal, becoming Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="dana">dana:</a></b> Giving, liberality; offering, alms. Specifically, giving of any of the four requisites to the monastic order. More generally, the inclination to give, without expecting any form of repayment from the recipient. Dana is the first theme in the Buddha's system of gradual training (see <a href="#anupubbi"><i>anupubbi-katha</i></a>), the first of the ten <a href="#parami"><i>paramis</i></a>, one of the seven treasures (see <a href="#dhana"><i>dhana</i></a>), and the first of the three grounds for meritorious action (see <a href="#sila"><i>sila</i></a> and <a href="#bhavana"><i>bhavana</i></a>).</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="devadatta">Devadatta:</a></b> A cousin of the Buddha who tried to effect a schism in the sangha and who has since become emblematic for all Buddhists who work knowingly or unknowingly to undermine the religion from within.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="dhamma">dhamma (Skt. dharma):</a></b> (1) Event; a phenomenon in and of itself; (2) mental quality; (3) doctrine, teaching; (4) <a href="#nibbana"><i>nibbana</i></a>. Also, principles of behavior that human beings ought to follow so as to fit in with the right natural order of things; qualities of mind they should develop so as to realize the inherent quality of the mind in and of itself. By extension, "Dhamma" (usu. capitalized) is used also to denote any doctrine that teaches such things. Thus the Dhamma of the Buddha denotes both his teachings and the direct experience of <a href="#nibbana"><i>nibbana</i></a>, the quality at which those teachings are aimed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="dhamma-vinaya">Dhamma-vinaya:</a></b> "doctrine (<a href="#dhamma"><i>dhamma</i></a>) and discipline (<a href="#vinaya"><i>vinaya</i></a>)." The Buddha's own name for the religion he founded.</p>

For the monks, there are thirteen such practices: (1) using only patched-up robes; (2) using only one set of three robes; (3) going for alms; (4) not by-passing any donors on one's alms path; (5) eating no more than one meal a day; (6) eating only from the alms-bowl; (7) refusing any food offered after the alms-round; (8) living in the forest; (9) living under a tree; (10) living under the open sky; (11) living in a cemetery; (12) being content with whatever dwelling one has; (13) not lying down.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="dosa">dosa:</a></b> Aversion; hatred; anger. One of three unwholesome roots <i>(<a href="#mula">mula</a>)</i> in the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="dukkha">dukkha(m):</a></b> Stress; suffering; pain; distress; discontent.</p>

					<h2><a id="e">E</a></h2>

In meditation, the mental quality that allows one's attention to remain collected and focused on the chosen meditation object. <i>Ekaggatarammana</i> reaches full maturity upon the development of the fourth level of <i><a href="#jhana">jhana</a>.</i></p>

					<h2><a id="f">F</a></h2>

					<h2><a id="h">H</a></h2>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="hinayana">Hinayana:</a></b> "Inferior Vehicle," originally a pejorative term -- coined by a group who called themselves followers of the Mahayana, the "Great Vehicle" -- to denote the path of practice of those who adhered only to the earliest discourses as the word of the Buddha. Hinayanists refused to recognize the later discourses, composed by the Mahayanists, that claimed to contain teachings that the Buddha felt were too deep for his first generation of disciples, and which he thus secretly entrusted to underground serpents. The <a href="#theravada"><i>Theravada</i></a> school of today is a descendent of the Hinayana.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="hiri">hiri-ottappa:</a></b> "Conscience and concern"; "moral shame and moral dread". These twin emotions -- the "guardians of the world" -- are associated with all skillful actions. <i>Hiri</i> is an inner conscience that restrains us from doing deeds that would jeopardize our own self-respect; <i>ottappa</i> is a healthy fear of committing unskillful deeds that might bring about harm to ourselves or others.</p>

					<h2><a id="i">I</a></h2>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="idappaccayata">idappaccayata:</a></b> This/that conditionality. This name for the causal principle the Buddha discovered on the night of his Awakening stresses the point that, for the purposes of ending suffering and stress, the processes of causality can be understood entirely in terms of forces and conditions that are experienced in the realm of direct experience, with no need to refer to forces operating outside of that realm.</p>

					<h2><a id="j">J</a></h2>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="jhana">jhana (Skt. dhyana):</a></b> Mental absorption. A state of strong concentration focused on a single physical sensation (resulting in <i>rupa jhana)</i> or mental notion (resulting in <i>arupa jhana).</i> Development of jhana arises from the temporary suspension of the five hindrances (see <a href="#nivarana"><i>nivarana</i></a>) through the development of five mental factors: <a href="#vitakka"><i>vitakka</i></a> (directed thought), <a href="#vicara"><i>vicara</i></a> (evaluation), <a href="#piti"><i>piti</i></a> (rapture), <a href="#sukha"><i>sukha</i></a> (pleasure), and <a href="#ekaggatarammana"><i>ekaggatarammana</i></a> (singleness of preoccupation).</p>

					<h2><a id="k">K</a></h2>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="kamma">kamma (Skt. karma):</a></b> Intentional acts that result in states of being and birth.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="kammatthana">kammatthana</a></b> Literally, "basis of work" or "place of work". The word refers to the "occupation" of a meditating monk: namely, the contemplation of certain meditation themes by which the forces of defilement <i>(<a href="#kilesa">kilesa</a>),</i> craving <i>(<a href="#tanha">tanha</a>),</i> and ignorance <i>(<a href="#avijja">avijja</a>)</i> may be uprooted from the mind. In the ordination procedure, every new monk is taught five basic <i>kammatthana</i> that form the basis for contemplation of the body: hair of the head <i>(kesa),</i> hair of the body <i>(loma),</i> nails <i>(nakha),</i> teeth <i>(danta),</i> and skin <i>(taco).</i> By extension, the <i>kammatthana</i> include all the forty classical meditation themes. Although every meditator may be said to engage in <i>kammatthana,</i> the term is most often used to identify the particular Thai forest tradition lineage that was founded by Phra Ajaan Mun and Phra Ajaan Sao.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="karuna">karuna:</a></b> Compassion; sympathy; the aspiration to find a way to be truly helpful to oneself and others.
