					<h4 class="ctr">Defining/Translating 'Sati'.</h4>

					<p class="f4">I have written about some of the below before, but there is an interesting development which I came across yesterday which I believe warrants a recapitulation as a lead in. So:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is relatively well known that the word 'sati' stands for both 'mind' and 'memory' (you can look it up in the PED if it is not well known to you), yet the translation 'mindfulness' persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not saying here that 'mindfulness' is not a correct understanding of an aspect of sati. I am saying that it's use has overbalanced the meaning to the side of 'paying attention' and it does not provide the richness of the term I would suggest, that is, 'mind'.</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe the translation 'mindfulness' has actually distorted the understanding of, the intent of, the Satipatthana sutta which is to my reading an exercise in the setting up, strengthening and organization of the mind via observation, investigation (comparing memory with memory) and memory.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a little puzzle riddle game that I believe shows us both the origin of the word itself and it's meaning:</p>

					<p class="f4">The word 'sati' is made up of two syllables:</p>

					<p class="f4">SA = one, once; and TI: three, this, thus</p>

					<p class="f4">If you use the word 'SATI' as a manta (mantra), repeating it again and again 1,3; 1,3; 1,3 ... there comes a time when the word breaks open and one becomes aware that there is something missing. What is that? 'Two'. It should be 1,2,3. This becoming aware of an issue and recollecting a solution, produces a certain <i>sati</i>sfaction in the mind. This, I say, is the true meaning of sati: the satisfaction of a fulfilled memory which is another way of saying a satisfied mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of course modern linguists and philologists will have a conniption fit reading this. But I would remind them that language did not just appear whole bang snap fingers done right from the start. Maybe not this world cycle, but once upon a time it started from scratch. Probably from the sound 'Ah.' And there would have been a period where there was delight in the composition of words and thought given as to how to make words stand for things that one wished to communicate to others. Starting from a language made up of single syllables, how does one describe memory?</p>

					<p class="f4">And then we have: "Once Thus". What is that but memory?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind is, at its most basic, memory. This meaning is lost completely with the translation 'mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand 'mind' has been and still is used for the idea of 'paying attention'. "Mind the children." "Mind your manners."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Mind' for 'mind' does not need explanation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But 'mind' for 'remember' has eluded me until yesterday when in reading a very entertaining and 'worldly-educational' writer of cowboy stories (including Hopalong Cassidy), Louis L'amour, his "The Lonesome Gods", wherein he uses dialogue from c. 1850 I came across this exchange (pg 259):</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">We were looking at him, waiting. "Paulino Weaver, he's moved in over yonder. Been here for some time."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Mountain man," Jacob said. "I mind meeting him some while back. He's a good man."</p>

					<p class="f4">And now that I read this, I mind hearing it before myself in actual conversations.</p>
