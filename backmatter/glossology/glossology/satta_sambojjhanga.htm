					<p class="f4">"Again, monks, a monk abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in respect of the seven factors of enlightenment. How does he do so? Here, monks, if the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness is present in himself, a monk knows that it is present. If the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness is absent in himself, he knows that it is absent. And he knows how the unarisen enlightenment-factor of mindfulness comes to arise, and he knows how the complete development of the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness comes about. If the enlightenment-factor of investigation-of-states<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is present in himself . . . If the enlightenment-factor of energy<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> is present in himself . . . If the enlightenment-factor of delight<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> is present in himself ... If the enlightenment-factor of tranquillity is present in himself ... If the enlightenment factor of concentration is present in himself ... If the enlightenment-factor of equanimity is present in himself, a monk knows that it is present. If the enlightenment-factor of equanimity is absent in himself, he knows that it is absent. And he knows how the unarisen enlightenment-factor of equanimity comes to arise, and he knows how the complete development of the enlightenment-factor of equanimity comes about.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dhamma-vicaya:</i> sometimes taken to mean 'investigation of the Doctrine', but the meaning is rather 'investigation of bodily and mental phenomena'. (MO: which amounts to the same thing.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Viriya:</i> This corresponds to Right Effort in the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Piti:</i> a term variously translated ... difficult to translate. Renderings vary from 'interest' through 'zest' to 'rapture'. It is classified not as a feeling (vedana) but as part of the group of mental formations (sankhara), i.e. as a mental reaction. BDic says: 'It may be described psychologically as "joyful interest"' — for which the simplest term would seem to be 'delight'. (Ed — no big deal problem with this, really, but plug "delight" into the search engine here and see what comes up ... a lot of different places where the word "delight" is used, very few of them having anything to do with Piti, many of them discouraging this 'mental reaction'. What we are looking for in this term is a factor in awakening. Delight is 'delight with' something that has happened; Piti is 'enthusiasm for' an aspect of one's practice that is leading to the goal. One should not, simply because of some small apparent progress, take delight in one's accomplishments.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">And of what sort is the effort to make become?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Herein a monk makes to become the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, that is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on ending, that ends in self-surrender. He makes to become the limb of wisdom that is investigation of Dhamma ... the limb of wisdom that is energy, that is so based. He make to become the limb of wisdom that is zest ... that is tranquillity ... that is concentration ... that is equanimity, based on seclusion, on dispassion, on ending, that ends in self surrender. This, monks, is called "the effort to make become."</p>
