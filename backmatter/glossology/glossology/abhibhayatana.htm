					<p class="f4">Perceiving the personally material one sees external materiality as limited, whether beautiful or ugly. Having so perceived, this is mastered thinking: "I know, I see."<br />
					Perceiving the personally material one sees external materiality as unbounded whether beautiful or ugly. Having so perceived, this is mastered thinking: "I know, I see."<br />
					Perceiving the personally immaterial one sees external materiality as limited, whether beautiful or ugly. Having so perceived, this is mastered thinking: "I know, I see."<br />
					Perceiving the personally immaterial one sees external materiality as unbounded whether beautiful or ugly. Having so perceived, this is mastered thinking: "I know, I see."<br />
					Perceiving the personally immaterial one sees external materiality as deep-blue, deep-blue-colored, characterized by deep-blue, having a deep-blue luster — in the same way as the so-called flax flower is deep-blue, deep-blue-colored, characterized by deep-blue, having a deep-blue luster — in the same way as Benares muslin burnished on both sides is deep-blue, deep-blue-colored, characterized by deep-blue, having a deep-blue luster - even so one perceives the personally immaterial and sees external materiality as deep-blue, deep-blue-colored, characterized by deep-blue. Having so perceived, this is mastered thinking: "I know, I see."<br />
					Perceiving the personally immaterial one sees external materiality as golden, golden-colored, characterized by a golden color, having a golden luster — in the same way as the so-called kanikara-flower is golden, golden-colored, characterized by a golden color, having a golden luster — in the same way as Benares muslin burnished on both sides is goldend, golden-colored, characterized by a golden color, having a golden luster - even so one perceives the personallly immaterial and sees external materiality as golden, golden-colored, characterized by a golden color, having a golden luster. Having so perceived, this is mastered thinking: "I know, I see."<br />
					Perceiving the personally immaterial one sees external materiality as blood-red, blood-red-colored, characterized by blood-redness, having a blood-red luster — in the same way as the so-called Midday-Flower is blood-red, blood-red colored, characterized by blood-redness, having a blood-red luster — in the same way as Benares muslin burnished on both sides is blood-red, blood-red-colored, characterized by blood-redness, having a blood-red luster.
