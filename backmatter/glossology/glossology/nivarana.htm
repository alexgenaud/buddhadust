					<p class="lgqt">PTS: Woodward, The Book of the Gradual Sayings, V: The Book of the Tens, VII, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.061.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.61 pp78</a>: "And what is the nutriment of the five hindrances? "The three wrong ways of practice." (of mind, speech, body) See: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.33.03.olds.bd.htm">The Compilation Threes:#3.3</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Bhante Punnaji, Awakening Meditation, pp8-55: "When the mind is free of the obscurants (nivarana) there is proper attention. Obscurants are the emotional excitements that prevent you from observing what is there. That is the main thing to understand. When you are free of those interferences then your mind is calm and rested and you are able to observe whatever is there. You are able to pay attention because your mind is not going after the past or the future, but just observing what is in the present moment. The ability to do that is facilitated by entering the jhana because the jhana is the state where the mind is free of the obscurants.<br />
					pp: 8-33: "When you experience the jhana, you are fully aware of the hindrances disappearing. In fact, when you become aware of them, they stop. They continue because you are not fully aware of them."</p>

					<p class="f4">MO: possible doubtful description of the sequence here in that it is frequently stated that the hindrances are gone before the First Jhana is entered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Thus abandoning these five hindrances, these taints of the heart which cause the weakenign of wisdom, aloof from unprofitable states, he enters on the first musing..."[<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p145">AN 10.145</a>]</p>

					<p class="f4">My view is that the tendency is to make a mysterious thing of the hindrances and their disappearance. For the second, for example, one is truly concentrating on understanding an element of the Dhamma, that time is free from the hindrances — look at the hindrances and look at the state of concentrating on the Dhamma; they are mutually exclusive —, and that is, by definition, the first jhana. What I think Bhante Punnaji is describing here is a stage a little further along the path: where the hindrances can be said to have been worn out, not just temporarily disappeared, but unable to return with similar force, greatly weakened or are eradicated completely ... or perhaps he is describing the state just prior to enterig the jhanas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">PTS: Hare The Book of the  Fives, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.075.hare.pts.htm#pg75">AN 5.75 pp 75ff</a>):<br />
					"And he resorts to some secluded spot: forest, tree-root, mountain, glen, rock-cave, cemetery, wooded upland, open space or heap of straw; and come to forest, tree-root or empty hut, he sits cross-legged, with body erect, setting mindfulness in front of him. Putting away all hankering, he abides with heart free therefrom; he cleanses his mind of hankering: putting away ill-will and hatred, he abides with heart free therefrom; kindly and compassionate to all creatures, he cleanses his mind of ill-will and hatred: putting away sloth and torpor, he abides free therefrom; conscious of light, mindful and self-possessed, he cleanses his mind of sloth and torpor: putting away flurry and worry, he abides poised; with heart serene within, he cleanses his mind of flurry and worry: putting away doubt, he abides with doubt passed by; no more he questions Why? of right things; he cleanses his mind of doubt.<br />
					Putting away these five hindrances, when the mind's corruptions are weakend by insight, aloof from sensuous appetites...he enters and abides in the first musing..."</p>
