					<p class="f4">'Gati' is derived from 'gacchati'; essentially 'going', but serves also for the way employed in going, the fact of having ended up in a place got to when one has gone that way, and the nature of that state. Two words can fit all that. So 'course' or 'going' for the process; and 'destiny' or 'fate' for the result would give us terms that do not conflict with the goal. However it looks like the problem here is in finding a way to translate the reverse: 'non-destiny' having no destination,  and/or 'bad destiny' and 'wrong-way'. How we get to 'wrong' from 'non or not' requires a little imagination. Think 'how do I say 'this is a bad place to go!' or 'this is a bad way to go!' the fastest/shortest way possible? "Not Go!"? Or the European 'No Go' sign? Then there is <i>āgati.</i> literally: to-going (think: from-going and to-going). We say 'coming'. PED does not have a separate listing for 'agati' other than it's meaning as a house with a peaked roof.</p>

									<p class="mozp"><b>Gati</b> (f.) [from gacchati; cp. Gr. <span class="spi">ba/sis</span>, Latin (in-) ventio, Goth. (ga-)qumps] 1. going, going away, (opp. āgati coming) (both gati and āgati usually in pregnant sense of No. 2. See āgati); direction, course, career. Freq. of the two careers of a Mahāpurisa (viz. either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha) ... the course, flight of birds ... "he knows her going away, i. e. where she has gone"<br />
									2. going away, passing on ( = cuti, opp. upapatti coming into another existence); course, esp after death, destiny, as regards another (future) existence A I.112; D II.91; M I.388 (tassa kā gati ko abhisamparāyo what is his rebirth and what his destiny*); in combination āgati vā gati vā ( = cutūpapatti), rebirth and death M I.328, 334. In defn. of saŋsāra explained as gati bhav¢bhava cuti upapatti = one existence after the other ... - The Arahant as being beyond Saŋsāra is also beyond gati ... and Nibbāna coincides with release from the gatis ... - attā hi attano gati "everybody is (the maker of) his own future life" ... esā maccharino gati "this is the fate of the selfish" ... sabbagatī te ijjhantu "all fate be a success to you" ... gato so tassa yā gati "he has gone where he had to go (after death)"<br />
									3. behaviour, state or condition of life, sphere of existence, element, especially characterized as sugati and duggati, a happy or an unhappy existence. gati migānaṃ pavanaṃ, ākāso pakkhīnaṃ gati, vibhavo gati dhammānaṃ, nibbānaṃ arahato gati: the wood is the sphere of the beasts, the air of the birds, decay is the state of (all) things, Nibbāna the sphere of the Arahant ... avijjāy' eva gati the quality of ignorance ... paramāya gatiyā samannāgato of perfect behaviour M I.82<br />
									4. one of the five realms of existence of sentient beings ( = loka), divided into the two categories of sugati ( = Sagga, realm of bliss) and duggati ( = Yamaloka, apāya, realm of misery). These gatis are given in the following order: (1) niraya purgatory, (2) tiracchānayoni the brute creation, (3) pittivisaya the ghost world, (4) manussā (m-loka) human beings, (5) devā gods: M I.73; D III.234; A IV.459; ... They are described in detail in the Pañcagatidīpana (ed. L. Feer, <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1884_i.pdf">J.Pāli Text Society 1884,</a> 152 sq.; trsl. by the same in Annales du Musee Guimet V. 514-528) under Naraka-kaṇḍa, Tiracchāna-, Peta-, Manussa-, Deva-. Of these Nos. 1-3 are considered duggatis, whilst Nos. 4  and  5 are sugati. In later sources we find 6 divisions, viz. 1-3 as above, (4) asurā, (5) manussā, (6) devā, of which 1-4 are comprised under apāyā (conditions of suffering, q. v.) or duggatiyo ...  These six also at D III.264. ... The first two gatis are said to be the fate of the micchādiṭṭhino D I.228, ... whilst the last two are the share of the sīlavanto (A. I.60).</p>

									<p class="mozp"><b>Āgati</b> (f.) [ā + gati] coming, coming back, return S III.53; J II.172. Usually opp. to gati going away. Used in special sense of rebirth and re-death in the course of saŋsāra. Thus in āgati gati cuti upapatti D I.162; A III.54 sq., 60 sq., 74; cp. also S II.67 ... </p>
