					<p class="lgqt">NOTE: These excerpts from the Dhamma are intended to be made into "posters", to serve as Memory Devices. Following the principles of <a href="../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_2.htm#DOWNBOUND_CONFOUNDED_ETC">Downbound Confounded Rebounding Conjuration</a>, as long as one is still bound up in the World, what one remembers is what one recreates in the future. This technique uses that phenomena to bring one back time and time again to those sets of ideas that will eventually provide the basis for becoming Unbound in the Complete and Utter Freedom of Objective Detachment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Copy these materials and arrange the contents in your word processor in an attractive and readable type and on One Page [IMPORTANT! -- so that they can be grasped at a Glance]. Put them on good paper, perhaps backed up by cardboard or framed or laminated and place them somewhere where they will be visible every day.</p>

					<p class="in1">Put away lying words, speak truth, from the truth never swerve; faithful and trustworthy, break not your word to the world, Put away slander, hold aloof from calumny.

Live as a binder together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for peace; Put away rudeness of speech, hold yourself aloof from harsh language. Whatsoever word is blameless, pleasant to the ear, lovely, reaching to the heart, PORI (urbane), pleasing to the people, beloved of the people -- those are the words to speak;<br />
					Put away frivolous talk, hold yourself aloof from vain conversation. Speak in season,&nbsp; in accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on DHAMMA, on discipline. Speak at the right time, words worthy to be laid up in one's heart, fitly illustrated with appropriate similes, logical, reasonable, to the point.</p>

					<h4>This is The High View of DUKKHA [Pain]:</h4>

					<p class="in1">Birth is DUKKHA, Aging is DUKKHA, Death is DUKKHA, Grief and Lamentation are DUKKHA, Pain and Misery are DUKKHA, Despair is DUKKHA</p>

					<p class="in1">Not to get what is Wished for is DUKKHA</p>
					<p class="in2">Not getting what is Wished for is in reference to the case when such and such a being wishes: "O,O,O If Only I were not subject to Birth, Aging and Death, Grief and Lamentation, Pain and Misery, and Despair!" for such is not to be had by Wishing.</p>

					<p class="in1">In sum: The Five Stockpiled Piles of DUKKHA are a heap of DUKKHA</p>
					<p class="in2">The Five Stockpiled Piles of DUKKHA are a heap of DUKKHA means: Material is DUKKHA, Sense Experience is DUKKHA, Perception is DUKKHA, Confounding is DUKKHA, Consciousness is DUKKHA</p>

					<h4>This is The High View of DUKKHA SAMUDAYA, The Origin of DUKKHA:</h4>

					<p class="in1">The Origin of DUKKHA is in that TANHA (Hunger/Thirst) leading to rebirth, confounded with Lust and Self Indulgence, seeking pleasure here and there, that is: the TANHA for Life, for Becoming, and for Un-Becoming.</p>

					<p class="in2">And this TANHA begins and is found in the material things which give pleasure that are downbound to the world and to which we are attached, that is: The [LOKA] spheres of the visible, hearable, smellable, tasteable, touchable, and knowable, [VINNANA] Consciousness of sight, sound, scent, taste, touch, and ideas, The [SAMPHASSO] stimulation of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and mind, [SAMPHASSAJA VEDANA] Sense Experience arising from the stimulation of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and mind, [SANNA] Perception of sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [SANCETANA] Intentions with regard to sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [TANHA] Hunger/thirst for sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [VITAKKA] Thinking in words about sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [VICARA] The Reliving in pictures and feelings of sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas.</p>

					<h4>This is The High View of DUKKHA-NIRODHA, the ending of DUKKHA:</h4>

					<p class="in1">The ending of DUKKHA is in the ending of TANHA, letting it go, giving it up, putting it away, eradicating it, eliminating it, burning it off, burning it up, burning it out, causing it to cease, becoming disenchanted with it, renouncing it, freedom from it, utter objective detachment towards it.</p>

					<p class="in2">And this TANHA ends and is put away in the material things which give pleasure that are downbound to the world and to which we are attached, that is: The [LOKA] spheres of the visible, hearable, smellable, tasteable, touchable, and knowable, [VINNANA] Consciousness of sight, sound, scent, taste, touch, and ideas, The [SAMPHASSO] stimulation of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and mind, [SAMPHASSAJA VEDANA] Sense Experience arising from the stimulation of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and mind, [SANNA] Perception of sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [SANCETANA] Intentions with regard to sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [TANHA] Hunger/thirst for sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [VITAKKA] Thinking in words about sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas, [VICARA] The Reliving in pictures and feelings of sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and ideas.</p>

					<h4>This is The High View of the Way to Accomplish the Ending of DUKKHA:</h4>

					<p class="in1">High View, High Principles, High Talk, High Works, High Lifestyle, High Satisfaction, and High Getting High.</p>

					<p class="ctr f4"><b>Beggars!<br />
					I have realized two things:<br />
					Not to be content when things are going well, and<br />
					not to give up when it is a struggle.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					And how does one not give up when it is a struggle?<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					By resolving: <br />
					"Let my skin and flesh and blood dry up while I wither to the bone<br />
					if only I can hang on long enough<br />

					by the energy of a man<br />
					by the effort of a man."<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					By my energetic effort<br />
					Beggars<br />
					I won unsurpassable freedom from bondage.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					And you, too<br />
					Beggars<br />
					do not be content when things are going well<br />
					and<br />
					do not give up when it is a struggle<br />
					but resolve:<br />
					"Let my skin and flesh and blood dry up while I wither to the bone<br />
