In the sixteenth year after the Enlightenment, the Buddha spent the whole of the rainy season at Āḷavī and preached the doctrine to 84,000 listeners. The King of Āḷavī was known as Āḷavaka and the inhabitants as Āḷavakā. The town later became famous as the residence of Āḷavaka Yakkha and of Hatthaka Āḷavikī. The therī, Selā was born in Āḷavī and was therefore known as Āḷavikā. There was evidently a large community of monks at Ālavī, some of whom seem to have chiefly occupied themselves with building vihāras for themselves.<br />

It was while staying in the woodland thicket there that the Buddha preached the <i>Ambaṭṭha Sutta</i> [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p3">DN 3</a>]. From this sutta, the village would seem to have been near Pokkharasādi's domain of Ukkaṭṭhā. It was the residence of "Mahāsā'a" brahmins. The <i>Sutta Nipāta</i> (which spells the name as Icchānaṇkala) mentions several eminent brahmins who lived there, among them Caṇkī, Tārukkha, Pokkarasāti, Jānussoṇi and Todeyya. There were also two learned youths, Vāseṭṭha and Bharadvāja at Icchānaṇkala, who, finding it impossible to bring their discussion to a conclusion, sought the Buddha, then staying in the village. Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in the <i>Vāseṭṭha Sutta</i> [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p98">MN 98</a>]. Buddhaghosa says that learned brahmins of Kosala, deeply versed in the Vedas, were in the habit of meeting together from time to time at Icchānaṇgala in order to recite the Vedas and discuss their interpretation.<br />
										According to the <i>Saɱyutta Nikāya</i> [<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.011.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.54.11</a>], the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchānaṇgala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food. But from the <i>Aṇguttara Nikāya</i>, it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchānaṇgala, having heard of the Buddha's visit, came to him in large numbers and created a disturbance by their shouts. The Buddh had to send Nāgita, who was then his personal attendant, to curb the enthusiasm of is admirers.</p>

When the Buddha accepted Anāthapiṇḍika's invitation to visit Savatthi, the latter, seeking a suitable place for the Buddha's residence, discovered this park belonging to Jetakumara. When he asked to be allowed to buy it, Jeta's reply was: "Not even if you could cover the whole place with gold coins. Anāthapiṇḍika said that he would buy it at that price, and when Jeta answered that he had had no intention of making a bargain, the matter was taken before the Lords of Justice, who decided that if the price mentioned were paid, Anāthapiṇḍika had the right of purchase. Anāthapiṇḍika had gold brought down in carts and covered Jetavana with pieces laid side by side. The money brought in the first journey was found insufficient to cover one small spot near the gateway. So Anāthapiṇḍika sent his servants back for more, but Jeta, inspired by Anāthapiṇḍika's earnestness, asked to be allowed to give this spot. Anāthapiṇḍika agreed and Jeta erected there a gateway, with a room over it. Anāthapiṇḍika built in the grounds dwelling rooms, retiring rooms, store rooms and service halls, halls with fireplaces, closets, cloisters, halls for exercise, wells, bathrooms, ponds, open and roofed sheds, etc.) The building, of which the Gandhakuti formed a part, was evidently called the Gandhakuti-parivena, and there the Buddha would assemble the monks and address them. The site, on which stands the bed of the Buddha in the Gandhakuti, is the same for every Buddha, and is one of the unalterable sites.)</p>

										<p class="f4">In all the amount said to have been spent in establishing the Park was 72 crores — as I understand it the coin used was the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#kahapana">Kahāpaṇa</a> which was square, was of a fixed weight of about 146 grains, and was usually made of copper or silver, but my recollection was that the Jetavana was paid for in gold. So, depending on which metal was used, and taking into consideration the fact that copper, at the time would have been considered much more valuable than it is today and silver and gold would not have been subjected to the manipulation of central banks as it is today (Tuesday, April 01, 2003 12:22 PM; Gold @335/oz), the price of the Jetavana would have been about $80,280,000,000 (today — Saturday, November 20, 2004 6:17 AM — with Gold @446.90/oz that would be $107,095,916,417)(Today, Tuesday, April 05, 2016 4:54 AM with gold at $1216/oz that would be $291,404,417,910) if the Kahāpaṇa was made of gold; $105,840,000 if made of silver; and $1,080,000 if made of copper.</p>

According to the scholiast of the Bhisa Jātaka, the tree-spirit mentioned in that story was the chief resident monk in an old monastery in Kajaŋgala, which monastry he repaired with difficulty during the time of Kassapa Buddha. Kajaŋgala is identified with the Kie-chu-hoh-khi-lo of Hiouen Thsang, which he describes as a district about two thousand li in circumference.

The Koliya owned two chief settlements — one at <a id="ramagama">Rāmagāma</a> and the other at <a id="devadaha">Devadaha.</a> The Commentaries contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas. We are told that a king of Benares, named Rāma, suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest. There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering aboüt, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five daughters of <a id="okkaka">Okkāka,</a> [the founder king of the Sakkaya Clan] she herself being afflicted with leprosy. Rāma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons. With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so. The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track <i>(vyagghapatha)</i> it was also called Vyagghapajjā. The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā. According to the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.5/jat.5.536.fran.pts.htm">Kunala Jataka,</a> when the Sakyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once "lived like animals in a Kola-tree," as their name signified. The territories of the Sakyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī. The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha. A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha. In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha’s stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara.</p>

										<p class="f4">Birthplace of the Buddha.<br />
										From the Times of India THURSDAY, AUGUST 01, 2002 10:30:38 AM: BHUBANESWAR: Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism who attained enlightenment 2,500 years ago, was born not in Nepal but in Orissa, researchers here claim.<br />
										The Buddha, they say, was born at a village that was earlier known as Lumbini near Kapileswar village on the outskirts of this city and not at the famous Lumbini in Nepal, noted archaeologist Chandrabhanu Patel says.<br />
										Patel, who is also head of the Orissa Museum, bases his claim on the findings of a research team led by him that examined rocks, inscriptions and other materials found in excavations.<br />
										Orissa has a host of ancient Buddhist sites, including Ratnagiri, Udaygiri, Lalitgiri, Kuruma, Brahmavana, Langudi and Ganiapali.<br />
										Excavators have found large domes, monasteries, sculptures and other objects of archaeological importance at these sites. The team's finding is based on research carried out at these venues.<br />
										Kalinga, as Orissa was known in that period, formed an important geographical niche between northern and southern India and maintained close trade and cultural ties with Myanmar, Sri Lanka and other Indian Ocean islands.<br />
										The turning point in Buddhist history came with Emperor Asoka's conquest of Kalinga in 261 B.C. The emperor, who later converted to Buddhism, is said to have sent his children to propagate Buddhism in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.<br />
										A stone pillar inscription of Asoka discovered at Kapileswar in 1928 and now in Ashutosh Museum at Kolkata points to the Buddha's birthplace being in Orissa, Patel said.<br />
										"Our scholars who read and deciphered the inscription found that it carries six lines in Prakrit language and Asokan Brahami script that say that in the 20th year of his coronation Asoka worshipped at Kapileswar as Lord Buddha was born here," Patel said.<br />
										While historians say that Buddha was born at Lumbini in Nepal, Patel said, a village near Kapileswar named Lembei could well be his birthplace. The ancient name of this village was Lumbini, he claimed.<br />
										The inscription says that Asoka exempted Lumbini village from all taxes in 240 B.C. because the Buddha was born there, Patel claimed.<br />
										A broken portion of Ashoka pillar nine feet high and 12 feet in girth was found in the Bhaskareswar temple located four kilometres from Kapileswar.<br />
										Broken bells and replicas of Asoka's famous four-lion emblem recovered from these areas are also currently at the state museum, he said.<br />
										Legend has it that the Buddha entered his mother's womb as a white elephant. At Dhauli, seven kilometres from Kapileswar, Ashoka carved out the statue of an elephant along with his edict.<br />
										Patel said researchers also found four sculptures of Ashoka in Kapileswar temple premises representing four stages of his transformation from a king to a sage.<br />
										Patel discounted the ancient inscriptions in Nepal identifying that kingdom as the Buddha's birthplace. He said Asoka had not installed those inscriptions.<br />
										Patel claimed the Buddha's relics in gilded stone caskets were found during an excavation at Lalitgiri in Orissa's Jajpur district in 1985.<br />
										Archaeologists had said the stone casket contains the ashes of the Buddha, who was cremated when he attained Nirvana at the age of 80.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.002.clans.htm#pg23">T.W.Rhys Davids: Buddhist India pp 23 ff:</a></p>

					<p class="f4">1. The <a id="rd_angas">Angas</a> dwelt in the country to the east of Magadha, having their capital a Champā, near the modern Bhagalpur. Its boundaries are unknown. In the Buddha's time it was subject to Magadha, and we never hear of its having regained independence. But in former times it was independent, and there are traditions of wars between these neighbouring countries. The Anga raja in the Buddha's time was simply a wealthy nobleman, and we only know of him as the grantor of a pension to a particular brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. The <a id="rd_magadas"><b>Magadhas</b></a>, as is well known, occupied the district now called Behar. It was probably then bounded to the north by the Ganges, to the east by the river Champa, on the south by the Vindhya Mountains, and on the west by the river Sona. In the Buddha's time (that is, inclusive of Anga) it is said to have had eighty thousand villages and to have been three hundred leagues (about twenty three hundred miles) in circumference.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. The <a id="rd_kasis"><b>Kāsis</b></a> are of course the people settled in the district around Benares. In the time of the Buddha this famous old kingdom of the Bhāratas had fallen to so low a political level that the revenues of the townships had become a bone of contension betdween Kosala and Magadha, and the kingdom itself was incorporated into Kosala. Its mention in this list is historically important, as we must conclude that the memory of it as an independent state was still fresh in men's minds. This is confirmed by the very frequent mention of it as such in the Jātakas, where it is said to have been over two thousand miles in circuit. But it never regained independence, and its boundaries are unknown.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. The <a id="rd_kosalas"><b>Kosalas</b></a> were the ruling clan in the kingdom whose capital was Sāvatthi, in what is now Nepal, seventy miles north-west of the modern Gorakhpur. It included Benares and Sāketa; and probably had the Ganges for its sosuthern boundary, the Gandhak for its eastern boundary, and the mountains for its northern boundary. The Sākiyas already achkowledged, in the seventh century B.C., the suzerainty of Kosala.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was the rapid rise of this kingdom of Kosala, and the inevitable struggle in the immediate future between it and Magadha, which was the leading point in the politics of the Buddha's time. These hardy mountaineers had swept into their net all the tribes between the mountains and the Ganges. Their progress was arrested on the east by the free clans. And the struggle between Kosala and Magadha for the paramount power in all India was, in fact, probably decided when the powerful confederation of the Licchavis became arrayed on the side of Magadha. Several successful invasions of Kāsī by the Kosalans under their kings, Vanka, Dabbasena, and Kaṃsa, are referred to a date before the Buddha's time. And the final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kaṃsa, as the epithet "Conqueror of Benares" is a standing addition to his name.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. The <a id="vajjians"><b>Vajjians</b></a> included eight confederate clans, of whom the Licchavis and the Videhans were the most important. It is very interesting to notice that while tradition makes Videha a kingdom in earlier times, it describes it in the Buddha's time as a republic. Its size, as a separate kingdom, is said to have been three hundred leagues (about one hundred miles) in circumference. Its capital, Mithitā, was about thirty-five miles north-west from Vesāli, the capital of the Licchavis. There it was that the great King Janaka ruled a little while before the rise of Buddhism. And it is probable that the modern town of Janak-pur preserves in its name a memory of this famous rajput scholar and philosopher of olden time.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. The <a id="rd_mallas"><b>Mallas</b></a> of Kusināra and Pāvā were also independent clans, whose territory, if we may trust the Chinese pilgrims, was on the mountain slopes to the east of the Sākiya land, and to the north of the Vajjian confederation. But some would place it south of the Sākiyas and east of the Vajjians.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. The <a id="rd_cetis"><b>Cetis</b></a> were probably the same tribe as that called Cedi in older documents, and had two distinct settlements. One, probably the older, was in the mountains, in what is now called Nepal. The other, probably a later colony, was near Kosambī to the east and has been even confused with the land of the Vaṃsā, from which this list makes them distinct.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. <a id="rd_vamsa"><b>Vaṃsā</b></a> is the country of the Vacchas, of which Kosambī, properly only the name of the capital, is the more familiar name. It lay immediately to the north of Avanti, and along the banks of the Jumna.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. The <a id="rd_kurus"><b>Kurus</b></a> occupied the country of which Indraprastha, close to the modern Delhi, was the capital; and had the Panchālas to the east and the Matsyas to the south. Tradition gives the kingdom a circumference of two thousand miles. They had very little political importance in the Buddha's time. It was at Kammāssa-dhamma in the Kuru country that several of the most important Suttantas — the Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna, for instance, and the Mahā Nidāna — were delivered. And Raṭṭhapāla was a Kuru noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. The two <a id="rd_pancalas"><b>Pañcālas</b></a> occupied the country to the east of the Kurus, between the mountains and the Ganges. Their capitals were Kampilla and Kanoj.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. The <a id="rd_macchas"><b>Macchas</b></a>, or Matsyas, were to the south of the Kurus and west of the Jumna, which separated them from the Southern Pañcālas.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. The <a id="rd_surasenas"><b>Sūrasenas</b>,</a> whose capital was <a id="rd_madhura">Madhurā,</a> were immediately south-west of the Macchas, and west of the Jumna.</p>

					<p class="f4">13. The <a id="rd_assakas"><b>Assakas</b></a> had, in the Buddha's time, a settlement on the banks of the Godhāvari. Their capital was <a id="rd_potana">Potana</a>, or Potali. The country is mentioned with Avanti in the same way as Anga is with Magadha, and its position on this list, between Sūrasena and Avanti, makes it probable that, when the list was drawn up, its position was immediately north-west of Avanti. In that case the settlement on the Godhāvari was a later colony; and this is confirmed by the fact that there is no mention of Potana (or Potali) there. The name of the tribe is also ambiguous. Sanskrit authors speak both of A.smakā and of A.svakā. Each of these would be Assakā, both in the local vernacular and in Pāli. And either there were two distinct tribes so called, or the Sanskrit form A.svakā is a wrong reading, or a blunder in the Sanskritisation of Assakā.</p>

					<p class="f4">14. <a id="rd_avanti"><b>Avanti</b></a>, the capital of which was Ujjeni, was ruled over by King Caṇḍa Pajjota (Pajjota the Fierce) referred to above. The country, much of which is rich land, had been colonised or conquered by Aryan tribes who came down the Indian valley, and turned west from the Gulf of Kach. It was called Avanti at least as late as the second century A.D., but from the seventh or eighth century onwards it was called Mātava.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. <a id="rd_gandhara"><b>Gandhārā</b></a>, modern Kandahar, was the district of Eastern Afghanistan, and it probably included the north-west of the Panjab. Its capital was Takkasilā. The Kinig of Gandhārā in the Buddha's time, Pukkusāti, is said to have sent an embassy and a letter to King Bimbisāra of Magadha.</p>

					<p class="f4">16. <a id="rd_kamboja"><b>Kambojā</b></a> was the adjoining country in the extreme north-west, with Dvāraka as its capital.</p>

					<h4>Highways (Trade Routes)</h4>

					<p class="f4">from: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.006.economics.htm#pg103">Rhys Davids, Buddhist India, pp103ff</a></p>

					<p class="f4">1. <i>North to South-west.</i> Sāvatthi to Patiṭṭhāna (Paithan) and back. The principal stopping places are given<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi1" href="#nbi1">1</a>]</sup></span> (beginning from the south) as Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Kosambī, and Sāketa.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. <i>North to South-east.</i> Sāvatthi to Rājagaha. It is curious that the route between these two ancient cities is never, so far as I know, direct, but always along the foot of the mountains to a point north of Vesāli, and only then turning south to the Ganges. By taking this circuitous road the rivers were crossed at places close to the hills were the fords were more easy to pass. But political considerations may also have had their weight in the original choice of this route, still followed when they were no longer of much weight.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi2" href="#nbi2">2</a>]</sup></span> The stopping places were (beginning at Sāvatthi), Setavya, Kapilavastu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Hatthi-gāma, Bhaṇḍagama, Vesāli, Pātaliputta, and Nālandā. The road probably went on to Gaya, and there met another route from the coast, possibly at Tāmralipti, to Benares.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi3" href="#nbi3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">3. <i>East to West.</i> The main route was along the great rivers, along which boats plied for hire. We even hear of express boats. Upwards the rivers were used along the Ganges as far west as Sahajāti,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi4" href="#nbi4">4</a>]</sup></span> and along the Jumna as far west as Kosambī.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi5" href="#nbi5">5</a>]</sup></span> Downwards, in later times at least, the boats went right down to the mouths of the Ganges, and thence either across or along the coast to Burma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi6" href="#nbi6">6</a>]</sup></span> In the early books we hear only of the traffic downward as far as Magadha, that is, to take the farthest point, Champā. Upwards it went thence to Kosambī, where it met the traffic from the south (Route 1), and was continued by cart to the south-west and north-west.</p>

					<p class="f4">Besides the above we are told of traders going from Videha to Gandhāra,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi7" href="#nbi7">7</a>]</sup></span> from Magadha to Sovīra,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi8" href="#nbi8">8</a></sup></span> from Bharukaccha round the coast to Burma,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi9" href="#nbi9">9</a>]</sup></span> from Benares down the river to its mouth and thence on to Burma,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi10" href="#nbi10">10</a>]</sup></span> from Champā to the same destination.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi11" href="#nbi11">11</a>]</sup></span> In crossing the desert west of Rājputāna the caravans are said<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi12" href="#nbi12">12</a>]</sup></span> to travel only in the night, and to be guided by a "land-pilot," who, just as one does on the ocean, kept the right route by observing the stars. The whole description of this journey is too vividly accurate to life to be an invention. So we may accept it as evidence not only that there was a trade route over the desert, but also that pilots, guiding ships or caravans by the stars only, were well known.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the solitary instance of a trading journey to Babylon (averu) we are told that it was by sea, but the port of departure is not mentioned.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi13" href="#nbi13">13</a>]</sup></span> There is one story, the world-wide story of the Sirens, who are located in Tambapaṇṇi-dīpa, a sort of fairy land, which is probably meant for Ceylon.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fnbi14" href="#nbi14">14</a>]</sup></span> Lankā does not occur. Traffic with China is first mentioned in the Milinda (pp. 127, 327, 359), which is some centuries later.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> KS. v. xviii (<a href="../../../backmatter/bibliography/bibliography.htm#DictionaryofNames">DPPN:</a> II: 1127)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> I hear tell this is a work of power only possible to Buddhas. It was apparently done numerous times by Gotama, but the most famous occasion was at the time when he laid down the rule that Bhikkhus were not to perform such feats in the presence of laymen. When the ajavikas heard of this rule they sensed an opportunity, and went around saying that they could match feat-for-feat any deed of the Bhikkhus. The Buddha, stating that this rule did not apply to himself, took up the challenge and stated that in seven days he would perform "The Twins" outside the city gates of Sāvatthi under a mango tree. Well then the Ajavikas went and uprooted every mango tree for a mile around the city, but this did not disturb the Buddha. On the day of the feat, he was given a mango to eat for lunch, and he instructed Ananda to plant the seed outside the city. Ananda did so, and the tree grew instantly to full height. This feat is performed by "Preaching while walking back and forth." It consists of presenting the body split into four sections (imagine a split-screen view of a body on your TV); the top two sections consist of one side showing the profile view and one side showing the facing view; the bottom two sections show the same, but on opposite sides. Multi-colored lights radiate out from the body, while each of the four sections alternate opposing displays of the four elements: the facing half of the upper portion, for example spewing fire from the mouth, while the profile side spews water from the ear.<br />
					During the performance of this feat several million individuals were apparently able to attain the state of Streamwinner, and it is after this event, so the story goes, that the Buddha went to the Tusita realm and preached the Abhidhamma to his mother. ...a story I simply cannot buy...and I don't have any trouble buying the story of the performance of this feat...I wonder if anyone has dealt with the issue as to whether or not the future Buddhas that wait their turn in Tusita are Streamwinners or Non-returners or whether they begin in their last birth on Earth, from scratch? Hum...to answer my own question, I believe it is a matter of doctrine that the idea of the SmmasamBuddha depends on the bodhisatva discovering The Way for himself, unassisted. This means he must not even be a Streamwinner at the time of the Great Renunciation. This means that the Buddha would have been wasting his time teaching the Abhidhamma to his mother, and I do not think the Buddha's deliberately waste their time. They may teach someone who asks a question knowing that individual will not understand the answer, but I do not think they would go out of their way to teach someone that would not understand.</p>
