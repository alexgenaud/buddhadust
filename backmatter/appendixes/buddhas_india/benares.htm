					<p class="f4"><b>Bārāṇasī:</b> The capital of Kāsi-janapada. It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārāṇasī, that the Buddha preached his <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">first sermon</a> to the <i>Panñcavaggiyā.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law <i>(Dhammacakka)</i>. It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the <i>Ājīvaka</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/upaka.htm">Upaka</a> (q.v.).</p>

					<p class="f4">Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthī,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>(the road passing through Bhaddiya,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>) and between there and Takkasīlā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasīlā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasīlā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Aŋga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Saṃyama.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārāṇasī is attributed to Mahā-govinda, its first king being Dhataraṭṭha, contemporary of Reṇu.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> The Ceylon Chronicles<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - <i>e.g.,</i> Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samaŋkara, <a id="pg276"><span class="f2 g"><b>[276]</b></span></a> and eighty-four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahma-vaddhana; in that of the Khaṇḍahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañ-jaya, Rammanagara;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> and in that of the Saŋkha, Molinī.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> says that "all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares." In the Brahāchatta Jātaka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vaŋka, Dabbasena and Kaṃsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kaṃsa because the epithet Bārāṇasīggaha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kosala, with the help of the Līcchavis, Kāsī, too, was included in his kingdom. Even in the Buddha's time the city of Benares was wealthy and prosperous and was included in the list of great cities suggested by Ānanda as suitable places for the Parinibbāna of the Buddha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Mention is also made of a Bānārasīseṭṭhi<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> and a Santhāgārasālā (Mote Hall), which was then, however, no longer being used so much for the transaction of public business as for public discussions on religious and philosophical questions.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span> Near Benares was a grove of seven <i>sirīsaka</i>-trees where the Buddha preached to the Nāga-king Erakapatta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span> and also the Khemiyambavana where Udena met Ghoṭamukha;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> on the other side of the river was Vāsabhagāma, and beyond that another village called Cundaṭṭhila.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha is several times spoken of as staying in Benares, where he preached several sermons<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> and converted many people including Yasa, whose home was in Benares,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> and his friends Vimala, Subāhu, Puṇṇaji and Gavampati, all members of eminent families.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> Isipatana (q.v.) became a monastic centre in the Buddha's time and continued so <a id="pg277"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span></a> for long after. From there came twelve thousand monks under the leadership of Dhammasena to be present at the ceremony of the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the	past, Bārāṇasī	was the birthplace of Kassapa Buddha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span> In the time of Metteyya Buddha, Bārāṇasī will	be known as Ketumatī, at the head of eighty-four thousand towns. Saŋkha will be Cakkavatti there, but he will renounce the world and will become an arahant under Metteyya.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span> Bārāṇasī evidently derives its name from the fact that it lies between the two rivers Barṇā and Asi.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span></p>
