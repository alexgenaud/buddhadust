					<h1>Rādha Thera</h1>

					<p class="g">PTS: DPPN ii, pp730</p>

					<p class="f4">He was a brahmin of Rājagaha who, being neglected by his children in his old age, sought ordination. The monks refused his request on the ground of his age, so he sought the Buddha who, seeing his <i>upanissaya,</i> asked Sāriputta to admit him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Soon after he won arahantship. He stayed near the Buddha, and, by reason of his skill, the Buddha declared him foremost among those who could inspire "speech in others (? <i>paṭibhāṇakeyyānaṃ</i>).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> He thereby earned the name of <b>Paṭibhāṇiya Thera</b>.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n1">3</a>]</sup></span> The Theragāthā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> contains two verses spoken by him in praise of concentration of the mind. The Rādha Saŋyutta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> contains a large number of suttas preached by the Buddha in answer to Rādha's questions on various topics. It is said that when the Buddha saw Rādha he felt the inclination to talk on matters dealing with subtle topics, illustrating them with various similes.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the time of <b>Padumuttara Buddha,</b> Rādha was a householder of <b>Haŋsavatī</b> and held a great almsgiving in honour of the Buddha, wishing to gain pre-eminence in the power of inspiring others to speak. He gave ripe mangoes to <b>Vipassī Buddha</b><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> and, as a result, was born in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Surādha Thera</b> <i>(q.v.)</i> was his younger brother. Rādha was, for some time, the Buddha's attendant.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Rādha Sutta.</b> — Rādha, before becoming an arahant, goes to the Buddha and asks for a teaching in brief. The Buddha tells him to abandon desire for what is impermanent — i.e., the eye, objects, eye-consciousness, etc.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					Rādha</h4>

					<p class="f4">Reborn in the time of our Exalted One at Rājagaha, as a brahmin, he was in his old age unable to perform his various duties. Being passed over,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> he went to the Master and revealed his needs. The Master, contemplating his graduation in essential conditions, ordered Sāriputta to admit him. Soon after that he won arahantship. And thereafter, keeping near the Master, he became pre-eminent among those who, deriving from the Master's teaching,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> could speak impromptu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now one day seeing how want of self-training occasioned governance by the passions, he exhorted thus:</p>

					<p class="F4 in2"><a id="th133-34">E'en</a> as into an ill-roofed house the rain<br />
					Doth pierce and penetrate continually,<br />
					So into mind by exercise untrained<br />
					Doth passion ever pierce and penetrate.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					And as into a well-roofed house no rain<br />
					Doth pierce and penetrate continually,<br />
					So into mind by calm and insight trained<br />
					Doth passion never pierce and penetrate.<sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></p>

					<p><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>It is probably this incident which is  referred to at ThagA. ii. 114<sup>[<a id="subn1" href="#subfn1">sub-1</a>]</sup>, where  Sāriputta is said to have ordained a poor brahmin named Rādha, but no  mention is made of any order from the Buddha. If the reference is to this same thera, Rādha was, for some time, the attendant (pacchāsamaṇa) of Sāriputta, and there is a verse in Thag.(993) spoken  to him by Sāriputta, who was pleased  with Rādha's gentle manner. DhA. ii. 104ff. gives more details of the ordination of Rādha. There we are told that he went to the monastery where he  performed various duties. But the  monks would not admit him into the  Order, and, owing to his disappointment, he grew thin. One day the Buddha, seeing him with his divine eye, went to him, and hearing of his wish to join the Order, summoned the monks and asked if any of them remembered any favour done by Rādha. Sāriputta mentioned that he had once received a ladleful of Rādha's own food while begging in Rājagaha. The Buddha then suggested  that Sāriputta should listen to Rādha's request for ordination. After ordination, Rādha grew weary of the food of the refectory, but Sāriputta constantly admonished him and found him most humble; later, he spoke highly of Rādha's obedience, and the Buddha praised him. It was on Rādha's account that the <b>Alīnacitta Jātaka</b> <i>(q.v.)</i> was preached. AA. i. 179 f. agrees, more or less, with the account given above; so does Ap. ii. 485 f.</p>

					<p class="in2"><sup>[<a id="subfn1" href="#subn1">sub-1</a>]</sup><span class="g">ThagA. ii. 114</span> ... Again, the Thera [Sāriputta] showing kindness to an unfortunate brahmin named Rādha, caused him to leave tho world and enter the Order.<sup>[<a id="subfn2" href="#subn2">sub-2</a>]</sup> Afterwards, while on tour, he admonished Rādha, pleased with his gentle behaviour:</p>

					<p class="in3">As one who shows where treasures hidden lie,<br />
					So is the man of wisdom who discerns<br />
					What to avoid, and utters sage rebuke:--<br />
					If such an able guide ye see and heed,<br />
					For you who follow, better 'tis, not worse.</p>

					<p class="in4"><sup>[<a id="subn2" href="#subfn2">sub-2</a>]</sup>This is more fully related in <i>Dhammapada Commentary</i> (Rādha-thera-vatthu'), ii. 104 ff., on verse 76. Rādha is probably the aged Thera of CXXVII., ordained by Sāriputta.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>A. i. 25; ThagA. i. 253 f. <i>paṭibhāṇakeyyānaṃ</i> Bhanaka would be a "reciter" of suttas, pati would indicate some sort of repartee — base meaning bounce or rebound — hear: rep-par-ti; plus the evidence in the suttas is not so much of his speaking, but of others being inspired to speak to him.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>SA. ii. 246.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup>vss. 133-4 .</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup>S. iii. 188-201; see also Rādha Sutta.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup>SA. ii. 246; this was because of Rādha's wealth of views (diṭṭhisamudācāra). and unwavering faith (okappaniya-saddhā); AA. i. 179; also ThagA. i. 254.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup>ThagA. i. 253; AA. i. 180; Ap. ii. 484.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup>AA. i. 163.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup>S. iii. 188-201.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup>S. iii. 79.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup>S. iv. 48f.</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup><i>Paṭikhitto.</i></p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup>The passage assigning him pre-eminence is then quoted from <i>Ang.,</i> i. 25. <i>Cf.</i> with Vangīsa's similar but not identical pre-eminence, Pa. CCLXIV. This Thera is possibly identical with the 'venerable Rādha' addressed in many short discourses of the Saŋyutta (iii. 79, 188<i>ff</i>.; iv. 48<i>f</i>.).</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup>"Exercise,''calm and insight' — in the text <i>bhāvanā</i> — the collective name for the systematized effort in self-training of the disciple who seeks perfection (<i>Bud. Psy.,</i> p. 261, n. 2). Specified as 'calm and insight' in the Commentary. <i>Cf. Compendium.</i> p. 202 <i>ff.</i></p>
