					<h1>Upaka</h1>

					<p class="f4">Upaka was the first human being encountered and spoken to by the Buddha after his enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not discussed in any of the stories concerning this event, but it is my impression that it's importance is in the fact that Upaka was not immediately convinced. In other words, that even if the Buddha needed no further instructing, a lesson for the rest of us in hearing this story is that not even for one who has achieved supreme enlightenment does everything suddenly go according to the ways one would wish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Upaka, a Naked Ascetic (Ājīvaka) encounters the Buddha <a href="../buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm">between the Bodhi Tree and Gaya</a>, shortly after he has set out to visit the group of five monks staying in Isipatana in the Deer Park after determining that they would be receptive to the teaching.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> He notices the Buddha's radiant appearance and comments:</p>

					<p class="f4">Warren: "Placid, brother, are all your organs of sense; clear and  bright is the color of your skin. To follow whom, brother, did you retire from the world? Who is your teacher? and whose doctrine do you approve?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Horner: "Your reverence, your faculties are quite pure, your complexion is very bright, very clear. On account of whom have you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose dhamma do you profess?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Nanamoli/Bodhi: "Friend, your faculties are clear, the colour of your skin is pure and bright. Under whom have ou gone forth, friend? Who is your teacher? Whose Dhamma do you profess?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha responds:</p>

					<p>Warren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'All-conquering have I now become, all-knowing;<br />
					Untainted by the elements of being.<br />
					I've left all things, am freed through thirst's destruction,<br />
					All wisdom's mine: what teacher should I follow?<br />

					No one to rival me exists.<br />

					I am The Teacher, unsurpassed;<br />
					I am The Buddha, sole, supreme;<br />
					Lust's fire is quenched, Nirvana gained.<br />

					"'To found the Doctrine's reign I seek<br />
					Benares, chief of Kāsi's towns;<br />
					And for this blinded world I'll cause<br />
					The drum of deathlessness to beat.'<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					"'Which is as much as to say, brother, that you profess to be a saint, an immeasurable Conqueror.'<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					"'Yea, were The Conquerors like to me,<br />

					<p class="f4">We hear that after this meeting Upaka went to the Vaŋkahāra country and there, having been attended to by a certain <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/018.twenty.verses.htm#LXVIII">Cāpā,</a> a hunter's daughter, fell in love with her and married her. Thereafter he made his living selling the meat the hunter killed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Cāpā, who had aparently admired Upaka as long as he had been an ascetic, began to dispise him for having been entrapped by her and endlessly ridiculed him to the end that he left her and making his way to Savatthi, he found the Buddha and entered the order. It was said he became an Anagamin and being reborn in the Aviha Realm reached Arahantship there almost immediately. Cāpā too, apparently joined the order and became an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>See: Dhammatalk: <a href="../../indexes/idx_first_sutta_resources.htm">Buddha's First Sutta</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>MN.I: #26: Ariyapariyesana Sutta, pp 170.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>If it wern't for "Star Wars", we might here say: "Aura"; in any case what is being spoken of here cannot be either the "faculties" of Nanamoli/Bodhi and Horner, or the Organs of Sense of Warren ... how would Upaka, or anyone else for that matter know of such things? What could be known is the feeling of power emanating from such a being, or the perception of his radiance, whether it be the ordinary look of well being we occasionally see about people, or a more supernatural perception of their force field.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup>Nanamoli/Bodhi, Horner and Warren all have "of all things," but if this is a true repetition of the conversation, the Buddha is responding to the question asking about whose "Dhamma" (teaching) he is following. I suspect these translators want to avoid the difficulty of what probably is the case, which is that at this point there is no such thing as a "Dhamma" of Buddhism. The paticca-samuppada is just "what is," and is beyond the speculative theories of the time, otherwise called "Dhammas." I have avoided the issue because of considerations of style.</p>
