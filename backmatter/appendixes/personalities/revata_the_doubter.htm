					<h1>Revata the Doubter</h1>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/bibliography/bibliography.htm#DictionaryofNames">DPPN:</a> He belonged to a very wealthy family in Savatthi. One day, after his midday meal, he went with others to hear the Buddha preach and, accepting the word of the Buddha, he entered the Order. He attained arahantship by way of practicing <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jhana.htm">jhana</a> — Before he became an arahant he was greatly troubled in mind as to what was permissible for him to use and what was not ... This characteristic of his became well known, hence his name.</p>

					<p>From the Psalms:</p>

					<p class="f4">His task accomplished thus [in becoming arahant], this great Brother reflected on the inveterate tendency of his mind to doubt, now wholly overcome, and praised the might and wisdom of the Exalted One, whereby his mind was now calm and steadfast, saying [bracketed word mine]:</p>

					<p class="f4">Behold how great the wisdom is of Them<br />
					Who Thus-have-come [Tathagata] As fire at midnight hour,<br />
					Givers of light, givers of sight are they<br />
					To those that pass, subduing all their doubt.</p>
