					<h1>Suro Ambattho</h1>

					<p class="f4">(<a href="../../../backmatter/bibliography/bibliography.htm#DictionaryofNames">DPPN:</a> An eminent lay disciple, declared by the Buddha foremost among his followers in unwavering loyalty (aveccappasannanam). He was born, in this Buddha-age, in a banker's family in Savatthi and became a follower of the heretics. One day the Buddha, seeing Sura's fitness for conversion, went to his door for alms. Out of respect for the Buddha, Sura invited him in, and, giving him a comfortable seat, entertained him to a meal. At the end of the meal, when the Buddha returned thanks, Sura became a sotapanna. Some time after the Buddha had left, Mara, disguised as the Buddha, visited Sura and, in reply to Sura's questioning, said that he had returned to contradict a wrong statement which he had made earlier. He had said that all sankharas were impermanent, etc., but, on further reflection, he had come to the conclusion that only some sankharas were of that nature. Sura recognized Mara and drove him away.</p>
