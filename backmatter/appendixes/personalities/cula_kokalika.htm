					<h1>Cūḷa Kokālika</h1>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr />

					<p class="f4"><i>Dictionary of Pali Proper Names</i>: He was the son of Kokāli-seṭṭhi of Kokāli and lived in the monastery erected by his father in Kokāli. Once the two Chief Disciples, desiring quiet, spent the rainy seson with him, he promising to tell nobody of their presence. After the rains, as the Elders were about to return, Kokālika informed the inhabitants of their stay and blmed them for not showing them hospitality. The townspeople hurried to the Elders with various offerings; these were, however, refused, and Kokālika, who had expected that the gifts would be given to him, was disappointed. The elders promised the townsmen to visit them again, and on their return were accompanied by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour. The gifts were divided among the monks, Kokālika not receiving a share. He thereupon became abusive, and the Chief Disciples left the place. The people were annoyed, and insisted that Kokālika should either bring them back or depart himself. The Elders refused to return, and Kokālika, in a great anger, sought the Buddha at Sāvatthi, and in spite of his injunctions spoke ill of the Chief Disciples. Having three times accoused the Elders of sinful desires, he left Jetavana, but boils immediately came out on his body, swelling and bursting. Groaning with pain, he fell down at the gate of Jetavana. His spiritual teacher, the <i>anāgami</i> Brahmā, Tudu, hearing his cries, came to him and begged him to seek forgiveness from the Elders. But he cursed the Brahmā and refused to listen to him. Kokālika died and was born in Paduma-niraya.<br />
					It was in reference to this incident that the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.3/jat.3.331.frni.pts.htm">Takkāriya Jātaka</a> was preached.<br />
					The Brahmā Sahampati informed the Buddha of Kokālika's birth in the Padumaāniraya.<br />
					The Kokālika Sutta was preached in reference to this Kokālika.</p>
