					<h1>Sono Kutikanno — Sona-Million-Dollar-Ears</h1>

					<p class="f4">From the Psalms:</p>

					<p class="f4">Reborn in this Buddha-age in the country of Avanti in the family of a very wealthy councilor, he was given the name of Sona. Wearing ear-jewelry worth a crore [not in PED]. Grown up, he became a landowner, and when the venerable Kaccana the Great stayed near his house, he ministered to his wants, learned the Norm, and finally growing disturbed, entered the Order through him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anon, while dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, he reviewed his achievement, and full of joy he breathed out these verses [brackets are translator's]:</p>

					<p class="f4">Not only did I ordination win,<br />
					Emancipated am I, sane, immune;<br />
					Yea, him have I now see, th'Exalted One,<br />
					And where he dwelt, there with him did I lodge.<br />
					Far through the night he stayed beneath the sky,<br />
					Then, versed in everything's abiding-place,<br />
					The Master in his chamber went to rest.<br />
					His robe spread Gotama and laid him down,<br />
					Like unto lion in a rocky cave,<br />
					For whom all fear and dread have passed away.<br />
					Thereafter in the presence of the Chief,<br />
					The Wake, did Sona, framing goodly speech,<br />
					Disciple of the Buddha, speak the Norm.<br />
					Well doth he know the factors of this life,<br />
					Well doth he cultivate the [Ariyan] Way,<br />
					So, having won to that most perfect Peace<br />
					Shall he complete becoming, sane, immune.</p>
