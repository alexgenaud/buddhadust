					<h1>Subhuti</h1>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/bibliography/bibliography.htm#DictionaryofNames">DPPN:</a> He was the son of Sumanasetthi and the younger brother of Anāthapiṇḍika. On the day of the dedication of Jetavana, he heard the Buddha preach and left the world. After ordination he mastered the two categories (of Vinaya rules [for women and for men]), and, after obtaining a subject for meditation, lived in the forest. There he developed insight, and attained arahantship on the basis of mettajhana. Teaching the Dhamma without distinction or limitation [that is as to whether or not an individual showed potential or not] ... It is said that when he went begging for alms he would develop mettajhana at each door, hence every gift made to him was of the highest merit. In the course of his travels he came to Rajagaha, and Bimbisara promised to build him a dwelling place. But the king forgot his promise, and Subhuti meditated in the open air. There was no rain, and, discovering the cause, the king had a leaf hut built for him. As soon as Subhuti entered the hut and seated himself cross-legged on the bed of hay, rain began to fall.</p>

					<p>From the Psalms:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well-roofed and pleasant is my little hut,<br />
					And screened from winds — Rain at thy will, thou god!<br />
					My heart is well composed, my heart is free<br />
					And ardent is my mood. Now rain, god! Rain.</p>
