					<h1>Brāhmin Jāṇussoṇī</h1>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr />

					<p class="f4"><i>Dictionary of <i>Pāḷi</i> Proper Names</i>: A mahāsāla brahmin, ranking with eminent brahmins such as Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasātī and Todeyya. He is mentioned as staying in Icchānaṅgala, where he evidently took part in the periodical gatherings of brahmin leaders — and also at Manasākaṭa. He was a follower of the Buddha, of whom he was a great admirer. He appears to have been in the hait of talking to well known teachers of other schools and hearing their opinion of the Buddha, either for the purpose of comparing his own faith in him or of discovering their views. Two such conversations are recorded — one with Subha Todeyyaputta, the other with Pilotīka. His discussion with Pilotīka he reorted to the Buddha, who expanded it to form the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p27"><i>Culahatthipadopama Sutta</i></a>. The Buddha also preached to Jāṇussoṇī the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.004.horn.pts.htm"><i>Bhayabherava Sutta</i></a>. Jāṇussoni's permanent residence was Sāvatthī, and he oftenvisited the Buddha at Jetavana, consulting him onmany topics, such as: results of actions (A. i. 56), <i>sandiṭṭhaka-nibbāna</i> (A. i. 157), <i>tevijja</i>-brahmins (A. v. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.119.wood.pts.htm">233 ff.,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#chxvii">249 ff</a>), the efficacy of gifts (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p177">A. v. 269 ff</a>), and eternalism and annihilation (S. ii. 76). He had a white chariot with silver fittings and white trappings drawn by four pure white mares. He wouuld drive about inthis, wearing white garments, turban-cloths and sandals and fanned by a white fan. The reins, the goads and the canopy were also of white. His chariot was considered the finest in all Sāvatthi. Buddhagosa says that Jāṇussoṇī was not his personal name but the name of the rank he held as chaplain to the Kosala king.</p>
