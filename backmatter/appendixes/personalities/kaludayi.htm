					<h1>Kaludayi</h1>

					<p class="f4">(<a href="../../../backmatter/bibliography/bibliography.htm#DictionaryofNames">DPPN:</a> Son of one of Suddhodana's ministers at Kapilavatthu; he was born on the same day as the Buddha and grew up as his playfellow. After Gotama left the world, Suddhodana made Kaludayi one of his most trusted counselors. When the king heard of his son's Enlightenment he sent several of his ministers with large retinues to bring the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, but they all became arahants as soon as they heard the Buddha's preaching and then forgot their mission [I doubt they forgot! — mo] In the end the king sent Kaludayi, on the understanding that he should first be allowed to join the Order. He went to the Buddha and, having listened to him, himself became an arahant. When the rains fell, covering the earth with the glory of leaves and flowers, Kaludayi felt that it was time for the Buddha to visit his kinsmen, and gave him their invitation, singing the season's beauties in a series of verses. The Buddha took sixty days in covering the sixty leagues from Rajagaha to Kapilavatthu, and each day Kaludayi went by air to the king's palace to tell him of the progress made in the journey and to bring back to the Buddha from the palace a bowl full of excellent food. By the time the Buddha reached his home his kinsmen were already full of faith in him. Because Kaludayi accomplished this feat, he was declared pre-eminent among those who gladdened the clans (kulappasadakanam).</p>

					<p class="f4">It is said that he was called Udayi because he was born on a day on which the citizens were full of joy and called Kala becauase of his slightly dark color.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the Psalms:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now crimson glow the trees, dear Lord, and cast<br />
					Their ancient foliage in quest of fruit,<br />
					Like crests of flame they shine irradiant,<br />
					And rich in hope, great Hero, is the hour.<br />
					Verdure and blossom-time in every tree,<br />
					Where'er we look delightful to the eye,<br />
					And every quarter breathing fragrant airs,<br />
					While petals falling, yearning comes for fruit:--<br />
					'Tis time, O Hero, that we set out hence.<br />
					Not over hot, nor over cold, but sweet,<br />
					O Master, now the season of the year,<br />
					O let the Sakiyans and the Koliyans<br />
					Behold thee with thy face set toward the West,<br />
					Crossing [border-river] Rohini<br />
					In hope the field is ploughed, in hope the seed is sown,<br />
					In hope of winning wealth merchants fare over sea.<br />
					The hope I cherish, may that hope be realized!<br />
					Again and yet again is seed in furrow sown.<br />
					Again and yet again the cloud-king sends down rain,<br />
					Again and yet again the ploughmen plough the field,<br />
					Again and yet again comes corn into the realm.<br />
					Again and yet again do beggars go their round;<br />
					Again and yet again the generous donors give;<br />
					Again and yet again when many gifts are given,<br />
					Again and yet again the donors find their heaven.<br />
					Surely a hero lifts to lustrous purity<br />
					Seven generations past wherever he be born.<br />
					And so methinks can He, the vastly wise, the god<br />
					Of gods. In Thee is born in very truth a Seer.<br />
					Suddhodana is named the mighty prophet's sire,<br />
					And mother of the Buddha was [our queen] Maya.<br />
					She, having borne the Wisdom-being in her womb<br />
					Found, when the body died, delight in Tusita.<br />
					She, Gotamid, dying on earth, deceasing hence,<br />
					Now lives in heavenly joys attended by those gods.<br />
					This is what Kaludayin said when he first went by iddhi power to Kapilavatthu:<br />
					The King asked: Who are you?<br />
					'If you know not the minister's son whom you sent to the Exalted One, know that I am he':<br />
					Son of the Buddha I, yea, e'en of such as He,<br />
					Th'Angirasa, to whom there lives not any peer,<br />
					Who that which is insuperable hath o'ercome.<br />
					And father of my Father art thou, Sakiyan,<br />
					To me thou, Gotamid, art grandsire in the Norm.</p>
