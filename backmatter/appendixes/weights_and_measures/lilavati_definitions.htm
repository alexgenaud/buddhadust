					<p><b>1.</b> Having bowed to [Ganesa] who causes the joy of those who worship him, who, when thought of, removes obstacles, the elephant-headed one whose feet are honored by multitudes of gods, I state the arithmetical rules of true computation, the beautiful Lilavati, clear and providing enjoyment to the wise by its concise, charming and pure quarter-verses.</p>

					<p><a id="p2"><b>2.</b></a> Two times ten <i>varataka</i>s [cowrie] are a <i>kakini</i> [shell], and four of those are a <i>pana</i> [copper coin]. Sixteen of those are considered here [to be] a <i>dramma</i> [coin, "drachma"], and so sixteen <i>dramma</i>s are a <i>niska</i> [gold coin].</p>

					<p><a id="p3"><b>3.</b></a> Two <i>yava</i>s [barley grain (a weight measure)] are here considered equal to a <i>gunja</i> [berry]; three <i>gunja</i>s are a <i>valla</i> [wheat grain] and eight of those are a <i>dharana</i> [rice grain]. Two of those are a <i>gadyanaka,</i> so a <i>ghataka</i> is defined [to be] equal to fourteen <i>valla</i>s.</p>

					<p><a id="p4"><b>4.</b></a> Those who understand weights call half of ten <i>gunja</i>s a <i>masa</i> [bean], and sixteen of [the weights] called <i>masa</i> a <i>karsa,</i> and four <i>karsa</i>s a <i>pala</i>. A <i>karsa</i> of gold is known as a <i>suvarna</i> [lit. "gold"].</p>

					<p><a id="p5"><b>5.</b></a> An <i>angula</i> [digit] is eight <i>yavodara</i>s [thick part of a barley grain]; a <i>hasta</i> [hand] is four times six <i>angula</i>s. Here, a <i>danda</i> [rod] is four <i>hasta</i>s, and a <i>krosa</i> [cry] is two thousand of those.</p>

					<p><a id="p6"><b>6.</b></a> A <i>yojana</i> is four <i>krosa</i>s. Likewise, ten <i>kara</i>s [hand, <i>hasta</i>] are a <i>vamsa</i> [bamboo]; a <i>nivartana</i> is a field bounded by four sides of twenty <i>vamsa</i>s [each].</p>

					<p><a id="p7"><b>7.</b></a> A twelve-edged [solid] with width, length, and height measured by one <i>hasta</i> is called a cubic <i>hasta</i>. In the case of grain and so forth, a measure [equal to] a cubic <i>hasta</i> is called in treatises a "Magadha <i>kharika</i>".</p>

					<p><a id="p8"><b>8.</b></a> And a <i>drona</i> [bucket] is a sixteenth part of a <i>khari</i>; an <i>adhaka</i> is a fourth part of a <i>drona</i>. Here, a <i>prastha</i> is a fourth part of an <i>adhaka</i>; by earlier [authorities], a <i>kudava</i> is defined [as] one-fourth of a <i>prastha</i>.</p>

					<p>The remaining definitions concerning time and so forth are to be understood [as they are] generally known from common usage. So much for the definitions.</p>

					<p>Now, the explanation of the places of numbers.</p>

					<p><b>9.</b> Homage to Ganesa, delighting in the writhing black snake playfully twining about his neck, bright as a blue and shining lotus.</p>

					<p><a id="p10"><b>10.</b></a> In succession, one, ten, hundred, thousand, <i>ayuta</i> [10<sup>4</sup>], <i>laksa</i> [10<sup>5</sup>], <i>prayuta</i> [10<sup>6</sup>], <i>kota</i> [10<sup>7</sup>], <i>arbuda</i> [10<sup>8</sup>], <i>abja</i> [10<sup>9</sup>], <i>kharva</i> [10<sup>10</sup>], <i>nikharva</i> [10<sup>11</sup>], <i>mahapadma</i> [10<sup>12</sup>], <i>sanku</i> [10<sup>13</sup>]; after that, </p>

					<p><a id="p11"><b>11.</b></a> <i>jaladhi</i> [10<sup>14</sup>], <i>antya</i> [10<sup>15</sup>], <i>madhya</i> [10<sup>16</sup>], <i>parardha</i> [10<sup>17</sup>]: these, increasing by multiples of 10, are the designations of the places of the numbers for practical use, produced by the early [authorities].</p>

					<p>That is the explanation of the places of numbers.</p>

No title page of this document, but presumably from someone's translation of the Lilavati of Bhaskaracarya, a summary of the state of mathematics in India c 1150AD according to the Vedic traditions. These measurements may not have any relationship to those used c.500BC (But I suspect the Magadha Karika is about this size in that the definition used in the suttas is 20 Karis which is further identified as a description of a beggars "load" of requisites...still looks like a lot to me, more than a bushel, not the load of a well-trained Buddhist Bhikkhu.</p>
