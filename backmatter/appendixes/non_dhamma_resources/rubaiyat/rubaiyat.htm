					<p class="f4">Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of Night<br />
					Has flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:<br />
					And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught<br />
					The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.<br />
					<br />
					2<br />
					<br />
					Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky<br />
					I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,<br />
					"Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup<br />
					"Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."<br />
					<br />
					3<br />
					<br />
					And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br />
					The Tavern shouted--"Open then the Door!<br />
					"You know how little while we have to stay,<br />
					"And, once departed, may return no more."<br />
					<br />
					4<br />
					<br />
					Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br />
					The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br />
					Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough<br />
					Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					5<br />
					<br />
					Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,<br />
					And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;<br />
					But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields,<br />
					And still a Garden by the Water blows.<br />
					<br />
					6<br />
					<br />
					And David's Lips are lock't; but in divine<br />
					High piping Pehlevi, with "Wine! Wine! Wine!<br />
					"Red Wine!"---the Nightingale cries to the Rose<br />
					That yellow Cheek of hers to incarnadine.<br />
					<br />
					7<br />
					<br />
					Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring<br />
					The Winter Garment of Repentance fling:<br />
					The Bird of Time has but a little way<br />
					To fly---and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.<br />
					<br />
					8<br />
					<br />
					And look---a thousand Blossoms with the Day<br />
					Woke---and a thousand scatter'd into Clay:<br />
					And this first Summer Month that brings the Rose<br />
					Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					9<br />
					<br />
					But come with old Khayyam, and leave the Lot<br />
					Of Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot!<br />
					Let Rustum lay about him as he will,<br />
					Or Hatim Tai cry Supper---heed them not.<br />
					<br />
					10<br />
					<br />
					With me along some Strip of Herbage strown<br />
					That just divides the desert from the sown,<br />
					Where name of Slave and Sultan scarce is known,<br />
					And pity Sultan Mahmud on his Throne.<br />
					11<br />
					<br />
					Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,<br />
					A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse---and Thou<br />
					Beside me singing in the Wilderness---<br />
					And Wilderness is Paradise enow.<br />
					<br />
					12<br />
					<br />
					"How sweet is mortal Sovranty!"---think some:<br />
					Others---"How blest the Paradise to come!"<br />
					Ah, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest;<br />Oh, the brave Music of a distant Drum!<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					13<br />
					<br />
					Look to the Rose that blows about us---"Lo,<br />
					"Laughing," she says, "into the World I blow:<br />
					"At once the silken Tassel of my Purse<br />"Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw."<br />
					<br />
					14<br />
					<br />
					The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon<br />
					Turns Ashes---or it prospers; and anon,<br />
					Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face<br />
					Lighting a little Hour or two---is gone.<br />
					<br />
					15<br />
					<br />
					And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,<br />
					And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,<br />
					Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'd<br />
					As, buried once, Men want dug up again.<br />
					<br />
					16<br />
					<br />
					Think, in this batter'd Caravanserai<br />
					Whose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,<br />
					How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp<br />
					Abode his Hour or two, and went his way.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					17<br />
					<br />
					They say the Lion and the Lizard keep<br />
					The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep;<br />
					And Bahram, that great Hunter---the Wild Ass<br />
					Stamps o'er his Head, and he lies fast asleep.<br />
					<br />
					18<br />
					<br />
					I sometimes think that never so red<br />
					The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;<br />
					That every Hyacinth the Garden wears<br />
					Dropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head.<br />
					<br />
					19<br />
					<br />
					And this delightful Herb whose tender Green<br />
					Fledges the River's Lip on which we lean---<br />
					Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows<br />
					From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!<br />
					<br />
					20<br />
					<br />
					Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clears<br />
					TO-DAY of past Regrets and future Fears---<br />
					To-morrow?---Why, To-morrow I may be<br />
					Myself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					21<br />
					<br />
					Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and best<br />
					That Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,<br />
					Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,<br />
					And one by one crept silently to Rest.<br />
					<br />
					22<br />
					<br />
					And we, that now make merry in the Room<br />
					They left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,<br />
					Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth<br />
					Descend, ourselves to make a Couch---for whom?<br />
					<br />
					23<br />
					<br />
					Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,<br />
					Before we too into the Dust descend;<br />
					Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie,<br />
					Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and---sans End!<br />
					24<br />
					<br />
					Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,<br />
					And those that after a TO-MORROW stare,<br />
					A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries<br />
					"Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There!"<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					25<br />
					<br />
					Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'd<br />
					Of the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrust<br />
					Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn<br />
					Are scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.<br />
					<br />
					26<br />
					<br />
					Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the Wise<br />
					To talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;<br />
					One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;<br />
					The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.<br />
					<br />
					27<br />
					<br />
					Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br />
					Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument<br />
					About it and about: but evermore<br />
					Came out by the same Door as in I went.<br />
					28<br />
					<br />
					With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br />
					And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:<br />
					And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd---<br />
					"I came like Water, and like Wind I go."<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					29<br />
					<br />
					Into this Universe, and why not knowing,<br />
					Nor whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:<br />
					And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br />
					I know not whither, willy-nilly blowing.<br />
					<br />
					30<br />
					<br />
					What, without asking, hither hurried whence?<br />
					And, without asking, whither hurried hence!<br />
					Another and another Cup to drown<br />
					The Memory of this Impertinence!<br />
					<br />
					31<br />
					<br />
					Up from Earth's Centre through the Seventh Gate<br />
					I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,<br />
					And many Knots unravel'd by the Road;<br />
					But not the Knot of Human Death and Fate.<br />
					<br />
					32<br />
					<br />
					There was a Door to which I found no Key:<br />
					There was a Veil past which I could not see:<br />
					Some little Talk awhile of ME and THEE<br />
					There seemed---and then no more of THEE and ME.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					33<br />
					<br />
					Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,<br />
					Asking, "What Lamp had Destiny to guide<br />
					"Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?"<br />
					And---"A blind Understanding!" Heav'n replied.<br />
					<br />
					34<br />
					<br />
					Then to this earthen Bowl did I adjourn<br />
					My Lip the secret Well of Life to learn:<br />
					And Lip to Lip it murmur'd---"While you live<br />
					"Drink!---for once dead you never shall return."<br />
					<br />
					35<br />
					<br />
					I think the Vessel, that with fugitive<br />
					Articulation answer'd, once did live,<br />
					And merry-make; and the cold Lip I kiss'd<br />
					How many Kisses might it take---and give!<br />
					<br />
					36<br />
					<br />
					For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,<br />
					I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:<br />
					And with its all obliterated Tongue<br />
					It murmur'd---"Gently, Brother, gently, pray!"<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					37<br />
					<br />
					Ah, fill the Cup:---what boots it to repeat<br />
					How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:<br />
					Unborn TO-MORROW, and dead YESTERDAY,<br />
					Why fret about them if TO-DAY be sweet!<br />
					<br />
					38<br />
					<br />
					One Moment in Annihilation's Waste,<br />
					One Moment, of the Well of Life to taste---<br />
					The Stars are setting and the Caravan<br />
					Starts for the Dawn of Nothing---Oh, make haste!<br />
					<br />
					39<br />
					<br />
					How long, how long, in infinite Pursuit<br />
					Of This and That endeavor and dispute?<br />
					Better be merry with the fruitful Grape<br />
					Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.<br />
					<br />
					40<br />
					<br />
					You know, my Friends, how long since in my House<br />
					For a new Marriage I did make Carouse:<br />
					Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,<br />
					And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					41<br />
					<br />
					For "IS" and "IS-NOT" though with Rule and Line,<br />
					And "UP-AND-DOWN" without, I could define,<br />
					I yet in all I only cared to know,<br />
					Was never deep in anything but---Wine.<br />
					<br />
					42<br />
					<br />
					And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,<br />
					Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel Shape<br />
					Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and<br />
					He bid me taste of it; and 'twas---the Grape!<br />
					<br />
					43<br />
					<br />
					The Grape that can with Logic absolute<br />
					The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:<br />
					The subtle Alchemist that in a Trice<br />
					Life's leaden Metal into Gold transmute.<br />
					<br />
					44<br />
					<br />
					The mighty Mahmud, the victorious Lord,<br />
					That all the misbelieving and black Horde<br />
					Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul<br />
					Scatters and slays with his enchanted Sword.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					45<br />
					<br />
					But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with me<br />
					The Quarrel of the Universe let be:<br />
					And, in some corner of the Hubbub coucht,<br />
					Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee.<br />
					<br />
					46<br />
					<br />
					For in and out, above, about, below,<br />
					'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,<br />
					Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,<br />
					Round which we Phantom Figures come and go.<br />
					<br />
					47<br />
					<br />
					And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press,<br />
					End in the Nothing all Things end in ---Yes---<br />
					Then fancy while Thou art, Thou art but what<br />
					Thou shalt be---Nothing---Thou shalt not be less.<br />
					<br />
					48<br />
					<br />
					While the Rose blows along the River Brink,<br />
					With old Khayyam the Ruby Vintage drink:<br />
					And when the Angel with his darker Draught<br />
					Draws up to Thee---take that, and do not shrink.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					49<br />
					<br />
					'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days<br />
					Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:<br />
					Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,<br />
					And one by one back in the Closet lays.<br />
					<br />
					50<br />
					<br />
					The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,<br />
					But Right or Left, as strikes the Player goes;<br />
					And He that toss'd Thee down into the Field,<br />
					*He* knows about it all---He knows---HE knows!<br />
					<br />
					51<br />
					<br />
					The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br />
					Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit<br />
					Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br />
					Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.<br />
					<br />
					52<br />
					<br />
					And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,<br />
					Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,<br />
					Lift not thy hands to *It* for help---for It<br />
					Rolls impotently on as Thou or I.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					53<br />
					<br />
					With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man's knead,<br />
					And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:<br />
					Yea, the first Morning of Creation wrote<br />
					What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.<br />
					<br />
					54<br />
					<br />
					I tell Thee this---When, starting from the Goal,<br />
					Over the shoulders of the flaming Foal<br />
					Of Heav'n Parvin and Mushtara they flung,<br />
					In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and Soul<br />
					<br />
					55<br />
					<br />
					The Vine had struck a Fibre; which about<br />
					If clings my Being---let the Sufi flout;<br />
					Of my Base Metal may be filed a Key,<br />
					That shall unlock the Door he howls without<br />
					<br />
					56<br />
					<br />
					And this I know: whether the one True Light,<br />
					Kindle to Love, or Wrathconsume me quite,<br />
					One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caught<br />
					Better than in the Temple lost outright.<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					57<br />
					<br />
					Oh, Thou, who didst with Pitfall and with Gin<br />
					Beset the Road I was to wander in,<br />
					Thou wilt not with Predestination round<br />
					Enmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin?<br />
					<br />
					58<br />
					<br />
					Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,<br />
					And who with Eden didst devise the Snake;<br />
					For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man<br />
					Is blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give---and take!<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					KUZA-NAMA ("Book of Pots.")<br />
					<br />
					59<br />
					<br />
					Listen again. One Evening at the Close<br />
					Of Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,<br />
					In that old Potter's Shop I stood alone<br />
					With the clay Population round in Rows.<br />
					<br />
					60<br />
					<br />
					And, strange to tell, among that Earthen Lot<br />
					Some could articulate, while others not:<br />
					And suddenly one more impatient cried---<br />
					"Who *is* the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					61<br />
					<br />
					Then said another---"Surely not in vain<br />
					"My Substance from the common Earth was ta'en,<br />
					"That He who subtly wrought me into Shape<br />
					"Should stamp me back to common Earth again."<br />
					<br />
					62<br />
					<br />
					Another said---"Why, ne'er a peevish Boy,<br />
					"Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy;<br />
					"Shall He that *made* the Vessel in pure Love<br />
					"And Fancy, in an after Rage destroy!"<br />
					<br />
					63<br />
					<br />
					None answer'd this; but after Silence spake<br />
					A Vessel of a more ungainly Make:<br />
					"They sneer at me for leaning all awry;<br />
					"What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?"<br />
					<br />
					64<br />
					<br />
					Said one---"Folk of a surly Tapster tell<br />
					"And daub his Visage with the Smoke of Hell;<br />
					"They talk of some strict Testing of us---Pish!<br />
					"He's a Good Fellow, and 't will all be well."<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					65<br />
					<br />
					Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,<br />
					"My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:<br />
					"But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,<br />
					"Methinks I might recover by-and-bye!"<br />
					<br />
					66<br />
					<br />
					So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,<br />
					One spied the little Crescent all were seeking:<br />
					And then they jogg'd each other, "Brother! Brother!<br />
					"Hark to the Porter's Shoulder-knot a-creaking!"<br />
					<br />
					67<br />
					<br />
					Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,<br />
					And wash my Body whence the Life has died,<br />
					And in the Windingsheet of Vine-leaf wrapt,<br />
					So bury me by some sweet Garden-side.<br />
					<br />
					68<br />
					<br />
					That ev'n my buried Ashes such a Snare<br />
					Of Perfume shall fling up into the Air,<br />
					As not a True Believer passing by<br />
					But shall be overtaken unaware.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					69<br />
					<br />
					Indeed the Idols I have loved so long<br />
					Have done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:<br />
					Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,<br />
					And sold my Reputation for a Song.<br />
					<br />
					70<br />
					<br />
					Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before<br />
					I swore---but was I sober when I swore?<br />
					And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand<br />
					My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.<br />
					<br />
					71<br />
					<br />
					And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel<br />
					And robb'd me of my Robe of Honour---well,<br />
					I often wonder what the Vintners buy<br />
					One half so precious as the Goods they sell.<br />
					<br />
					72<br />
					<br />
					Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!<br />
					That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close!<br />
					The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,<br />
					Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows!<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					73<br />
					<br />
					Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire<br />
					To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,<br />
					Would not we shatter it to bits---and then<br />
					Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!<br />
					<br />
					74<br />
					<br />
					Ah, Moon of my Delight who Know'st no wane<br />
					The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:<br />
					How oft hereafter rising shall she look<br />
					Through this same Garden after me---in vain!<br />
					<br />
					75<br />
					<br />
					And when Thyself with shining Foot shall pass<br />
					Among the Guests Star-scatter'd on the Grass,<br />
					And in thy joyous Errand reach the Spot<br />
					Where I made one---turn down an empty Glass!<br />
					<br />
					TAMAM SHUD (It is completed.)<br />

					And now the modified and added version which is the Text of<br />

					<br />
					Wake! For the Sun, who scatter'd into flight<br />
					The Stars before him from the Field of Night,<br />
					Drives Night along with them from Heav'n, and strikes<br />
					The Sultan's Turret with a Shaft of Light.<br />

					Modified and added version which is the Text of<br />
					the Fifth Edition (1889):<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					2<br />
					<br />
					Before the phantom of False morning died,<br />
					Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,<br />
					"When all the Temple is prepared within,<br />
					"Why nods the drowsy Worshiper outside?"<br />
					<br />
					3<br />
					<br />
					And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br />
					The Tavern shouted---"Open then the Door!<br />
					"You know how little while we have to stay,<br />
					"And, once departed, may return no more."<br />
					<br />
					4<br />
					<br />
					Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br />
					The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br />
					Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Boug<br />
					Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.<br />
					<br />
					5<br />
					<br />
					Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose,<br />
					And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;<br />
					But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine,<br />
					And many a Garden by the Water blows.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					6<br />
					<br />
					And David's Lips are lockt; but in divine<br />
					High-piping Pehlevi, with "Wine! Wine! Wine!<br />
					"Red Wine!"---the Nightingale cries to the Rose<br />
					That sallow cheek of hers to incarnadine.<br />
					<br />
					7<br />
					<br />
					Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br />
					Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling:<br />
					The Bird of Time has but a little way<br />
					To flutter---and the Bird is on the Wing.<br />
					<br />
					8<br />
					<br />
					Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,<br />
					Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,<br />
					The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,<br />
					The Leaves of Life keeps falling one by one.<br />
					<br />
					9<br />
					<br />
					Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say:<br />
					Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?<br />
					And this first Summer month that brings the Rose<br />
					Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away.<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					*****<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					It is us, the wine, the music, and this run-down corner;<br />
					Our flesh and heart, the wine glass, and our cloths,<br />
					all filled with the desire for wine;<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					Free from the hope of forgiveness and free from the<br />
					fear of punishment and pain<br />
					free from dirty wind, fire, and water.</p>
