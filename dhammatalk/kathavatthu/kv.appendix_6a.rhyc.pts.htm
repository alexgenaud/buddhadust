					<h1>Niyama, Niyāma: 'Assurance.'</h1>

					<p class="f4"><i>Niyama</i> means 'fixity,' but <i>niyāma</i> is 'that which fixes.' The former is derived from <i>ni - yam - ati,</i> to fix; the latter from the causative: <i>niyāmeti,</i> to cause to be fixed. When the Path — <i>i.e.,</i> a certain direction, course, tendency, profession, progressive system of a person's life — is called <i>sammatta,</i> or, contrariwise, <i>micchatta-niyāma,</i> both forms are understood in the causal sense. Thus the former 'path' inevitably establishes the state of exemption from <i>apāya's</i> (rebirth in misery), and the latter inevitably establishes purgatorial retribution after the next death. <i>Niyāma,</i> then, is that by which the <i>Niyama</i> (the fixed, or inevitable order of things) is established, or that by which fixity is brought about, or marked out in the order of things.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> (With reference to the apparently indiscriminate use of <i>niyama, niyāma</i> — see p. 275, n. 1 — the Burmese are wont carelessly to write the former for the latter, because they <i>always</i> pronounce the a short and quick.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>)</p>

					<p class="f4">Our choice of Assurance may seem to give an undue subjectivity to the pair of terms. It is true that it lends itself here to criticism. And we confess that the wish to get a term with the religious expressiveness that Assurance bears with it for readers nurtured in Christian tradition overbore our first thought of choosing certainty, fixity, fixed order. We may, however, add to our apology (1) that in XIX. 7, § 1, 'assurance' is opposed to 'doubt,' which is unquestionably subjective; (2) that both 'assurance' and the Greek <i>plērophoria</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> have both an objective and a subjective import. 'Assurance' may mean a means or orderly arrangement through which we attain assured feeling, say, about our property. The Greek word is simply a 'full conveyance,' to wit, of news or evidence.</p>

					<p class="f4">We should not therefore be far from the truth in considering our twin terms rendered by Assurance as the more <i>subjective aspect</i> of the Buddhist notion of course or destiny popularly and objectively expressed as Path <i>(magga)</i> — path good or bad: — the Way, narrow or broad, the Path, <i>hodos, via,</i> of Christian doctrine, 'the way of his saints,' 'the way of the evil man' of the Jewish doctrine (Prov. ii.8, 12)</p>
