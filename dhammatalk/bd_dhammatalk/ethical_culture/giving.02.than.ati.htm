					<h2>A treasure</h2>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the treasure of generosity? There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones, his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess, living at home, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous, responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms. This is called the treasure of generosity."</p>

					<h2>A requisite for spiritual progress</h2>

					<p class="f4">"Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering and remaining in the first <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-samadhi/jhana.html">jhana</a>... the second jhana... the third jhana... the fourth jhana; incapable of realizing the fruit of <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/into_the_stream.html">stream-entry</a>... the fruit of once-returning... the fruit of non-returning... arahantship. Which five? Stinginess as to one's monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one's family [of supporters], stinginess as to one's gains, stinginess as to one's status, and ingratitude. Without abandoning these five qualities, one is incapable of entering and remaining in the second jhana... the third jhana... the fourth jhana; one is incapable realizing the fruit of stream-entry... the fruit of once-returning... the fruit of non-returning... arahantship.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With the abandoning of these five qualities, one is capable of entering and remaining in the second jhana... the third jhana... the fourth jhana; capable of realizing the fruit of stream-entry... the fruit of once-returning... the fruit of non-returning... arahantship..."</p>

					<h2>The rewards of giving</h2>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five rewards of generosity: One is dear and appealing to people at large, one is admired by good people, one's good name is spread about, one does not stray from the rightful duties of the householder, and with the break-up of the body at death, one reappears in a good destination, in the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/">heavenly worlds</a>."</p>

					<p>&mdash; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p35">AN 5.35</a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Buddha:] "Then there is the case where a certain person refrains from taking life, refrains from taking what is not given, refrains from sensual misconduct, refrains from false speech, refrains from divisive speech, refrains from abusive speech, refrains from idle chatter, is not covetous, bears no ill will, and has right views. And he gives food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, and lamps to priests and contemplatives. With the break-up of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of human beings. There he experiences the five strings of human sensuality [delightful sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations]. It's because he refrained from taking what is not given, refrained from sensual misconduct, refrained from false speech, refrained from divisive speech, refrained from abusive speech, refrained from idle chatter, was not covetous, bore no ill will, and had right views that he reappears in the company of human beings. And it's because he gave food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, and lamps to priests and contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of human sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similarly for the case of rebirth in the company of devas] "...It's because he refrained from taking what is not given... and had right views that he reappears in the company of devas. And it's because he gave food, drink, cloth, vehicles, garlands, scents, creams, bed, lodging, and lamps to priests and contemplatives that he experiences the five strings of divine sensuality. But at any rate, brahman, the donor does not go without reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">[The brahman Janussonin:] "It's amazing, Master Gotama, it's astounding, how it's enough to make one want to give a gift, enough to make one want to make an offering, where the donor does not go without reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, brahman. That's the way it is. The donor does not go without reward."</p>

					<h2>Never underestimate the power of small gifts</h2>

					<p class="f4">"Even if a person throws the rinsings of a bowl or a cup into a village pool or pond, thinking, 'May whatever animals live here feed on this,' that would be a source of merit."</p>

					<p>&mdash; <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/03_threes/an03.057.than.ati.htm">AN 3.57</a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>What isn't given is lost</h2>

					<p class="f4">So when the world is on fire<br />
					with aging and death,<br />
					one should salvage [one's wealth] by giving:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;what's given is well salvaged.</p>

					<p class="f4">What's given bears fruit as pleasure.<br />
					What isn't given does not:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;thieves take it away, or kings;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;it gets burnt by fire or lost.</p>

					<h2>Overcoming miserliness</h2>

					<p class="f4">Conquer anger<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;with lack of anger;<br />
					bad, with good;<br />
					stinginess, with a gift;<br />
					a liar, with truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the miser fears,<br />
					that keeps him from giving,<br />
					is the very danger that comes<br />
					when he doesn't give.</p>

					Those who don't praise giving<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are fools.<br />
					The enlightened<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;and so find ease<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;in the world beyond.</p>

					<h2>Giving even one's last meal</h2>

					<p class="f4">"If beings knew, as I know, the results of giving and sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of miserliness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift. But because beings do not know, as I know, the results of giving and sharing, they eat without having given. The stain of miserliness overcomes their minds."</p>

					<h2>Giving at the proper time</h2>

					<p class="f4">In the proper season they give &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;those with discernment,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;responsive, free from stinginess.<br />
					Having been given in proper season,<br />
					with hearts inspired by the Noble Ones<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;  straightened, Such  &mdash;<br />
					their offering bears an abundance.<br />
					Those who rejoice in that gift<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;or give assistance,<br />
					they, too, have a share of the merit,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;and the offering isn't depleted by that.<br />
					So, with an unhesitant mind,<br />
					one should give where the gift bears great fruit.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;Merit is what establishes<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;living beings in the next life.</p>

					<h2>Many fruits</h2>

					<p class="f4">[General Siha:] "Is it possible, lord, to point out a fruit of generosity visible in the here and now?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Buddha:] "It is possible, Siha. One who gives, who is a master of giving, is dear and charming to people at large. And the fact that who gives, who is a master of giving, is dear and charming to people at large: this is a fruit of generosity visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Furthermore, good people, people of integrity, admire one who gives, who is a master of giving. And the fact that good people, people of integrity, admire one who gives, who is a master of giving: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Furthermore, the fine reputation of one who gives, who is a master of giving, is spread far and wide. And the fact that the fine reputation of one who gives, who is a master of giving, is spread far and wide: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Furthermore, when one who gives, who is a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people &mdash; noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives &mdash; he/she does so confidently and without embarrassment. And the fact that when one who gives, who is a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people &mdash; noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives &mdash; he/she does so confidently and without embarrassment: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Furthermore, at the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world. And the fact that at the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/">heavenly world</a>: this is a fruit of generosity in the next life."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, General Siha said to the Blessed One: "As for the four fruits of generosity visible in the here and now that have been pointed out by the Blessed One, it's not the case that I go by conviction in the Blessed One with regard to them. I know them, too. I am one who gives, a master of giving, dear and charming to people at large. I am one who gives, a master of giving; good people, people of integrity, admire me. I am one who gives, a master of giving, and my fine reputation is spread far and wide: 'Siha is generous, a doer, a supporter of the Saŋgha.' I am one who gives, a master of giving, and when I approach any assembly of people &mdash; noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives &mdash; I do so confidently and without embarrassment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when the Blessed One says to me, 'At the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world,' that I do not know. That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Siha. So it is. At the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
