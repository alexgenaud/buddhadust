					<p>Please note: I have been re-reading the whole of this site as of 12/17/21 and have found one thing that should be brought to your attention in spite of the hazards (no real coordination between mind and hand resulting in some serious problems which force me to keep from updating this site) (I am able to do this with lots of time and corrections!): Here and there especially here in the archives I have referred to <i>Nibbāna</i> as Un-Conditioned. This at a later time, on discovering that this is a mistranslation (see <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is <i>Nibbāna</i> conditioned?</a>), I have corrected. <i>Nibbāna</i> is conditioned; it is just not <i>Sankharamed</i> (own-made, or constructed.) Please mentally adjust this when encountered.</p>
