					<h1>Now is the Time!</h1>

					<p class="f4">Friends! I have seen the Hell that is brought about by attachment to the six senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">There every sight seen by the eye is painful, repulsive, ugly, disagreeable, not very enchanting!</p>

					<p class="f4">Every sound heard by the ear is painful, repulsive, ugly, disagreeable, not very enchanting!</p>

					<p class="f4">Every scent, taste, and touch is painful, repulsive, ugly, disagreeable, not very enchanting!</p>

					<p class="f4">Every thought is painful, repulsive, ugly, disagreeable, not very enchanting!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is lucky for us, my friends, that we have been born at a time when the True <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm"><i>Dhamma</i></a> is still available to us. We have done badly by <br />
					missing the time to live the Good Life under Gotama in his lifetime; let us not compound the error by being careless here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <i>Dhamma</i> is available. It teaches us how to meditate. It points out the way to <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimutti.htm">freedom</a> in <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upekkha.htm">objective detachment.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the Time! Make <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMAVAYAMA">effort</a> in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I H<span class="f2">EAR</span> T<span class="f2">ELL:</span><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a Time, the Lucky Man, Sakka Territory, Devadada town revisiting, said words to this effect:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars! I have seen the Hell brought about by attachment to the Six Senses! There whatever one sees, it appears uninviting, repulsive, not charming, ugly, not lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever one hears, smells, tastes, touches or thinks about it is sensed as uninviting, repulsive, not charming, ugly, not lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars! I have seen the Heaven brought about by attachment to the Six Senses! There whatever one sees, it appears inviting, attractive, enchanting, beautiful, lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever one hears, smells, tastes, touches or thinks about it is sensed as inviting, attractive, enchanting, beautiful, lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is well done for you, Beggars, that you have attained the right time to live the good life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gods and Men, Beggars, delight in objects, are entranced by objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of the impermanence of objects, the coming to an end of objects, the vanishing of objects, Beggars, that Gods and Men live in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gods and Men, Beggars, delight in sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and thinking.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of the impermanence of objects that sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and thinking also are impermanent, come to an end and vanish.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of the impermanence of<br />
					sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and thinking,<br />
					the coming to an end of<br />
					sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and thinking,<br />
					the vanishing of<br />
					sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches and thinking,<br />
					that Gods and Men live in Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Teacher, Beggars, sees objects as they really are.<br />
					He sees their origin and their end,<br />
					the satisfaction and the misery associated with them, and<br />
					he sees the way of escape from objects and<br />
					does not delight in objects,<br />
					he finds no pleasure in objects,<br />
					he is not enchanted by objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Beggars,<br />
					it is because of seeing the impermanence of objects,<br />
					it is because of seeing that they come to an end,<br />
					it is because of seeing that they vanish,<br />
					that the Teacher lives at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is not yours, Beggars, put that away!</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br />
					will be for your gain and profit<br />
					for many a long day!</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is not "yours"?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye, Beggars, is not yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear, Beggars, is not yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose, tongue, and body, Beggars, are not yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind, Beggars, is not yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Beggars,<br />
					put them away!<br />
					Putting them away will be<br />
					for your gain and profit<br />
					for many a long day!</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Beggars, as in the case of a man who came along and gathered up all the grass and leaves and sticks and limbs and trunks of all the trees in this <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> and were to destroy them by fire; would you say:<br />
					"This man is gathering us up, this man is burning us, this man is doing what he wills with us?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of course not!</p>

					<p class="f4">How Come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that grass and those leaves and sticks and limbs and trunks of trees are<br />
					not "you",<br />
					not "a part of you, and<br />
					are seen to be not "you",<br />
					not "a part of you."<br />
					That's how come!</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you, Beggars,<br />
					old <i>kamma</i> and<br />
					new <i>kamma,</i><br />
					the escape from <i>kamma,</i> and<br />
					the way leading to the escape from <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Pay Attention!<br />
					Give Ear!<br />
					I will Speak!</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is old <i>kamma?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The eye, Beggars, is old <i>kamma</i>!<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> It has come to be as a consequence of identifying with intentional acts of body, word-thought-and-speech, and mind with the idea of creating <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vedana.htm">sense experiences.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The ear, nose, tongue and body are old <i>kamma!</i> They have come to be as a consequence of identifying with intentional acts of body, word-thought-and-speech, and mind, with the idea of creating sense experiences.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is old <i>kamma</i>! It has come to be as a consequence of identifying with intentional acts of body, word-thought-and-speech, and mind with the idea of creating sense experiences.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what is called "old <i>kamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is new <i>kamma?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The identifying with intentional acts of body, word-thought-and-speech, and mind with the idea of creating sense experiences.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called "new <i>kamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the escape from <i>kamma?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is that not-doing of acts of body, word-thought-and-speech, and mind that results in freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the "escape from <i>kamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is The Way leading to the escape from <i>kamma?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is this <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm">all-round limitless way,</a> that is:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMADITTHI">High View,</a><br />

					<p class="f4">This is what is called "The way leading to the escape from <i>kamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">I have taught you, Beggars, about old <i>kamma</i> and about new <i>kamma</i> and about the escape from <i>kamma,</i> and about the way leading to the escape from <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, Beggars, should be done by a teacher, out of compassion for the profit of his disciples, that has been done by me, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are the roots of trees, here are places of solitude!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not be careless, Beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not give yourself cause for regret later!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the Time!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> A footnote in the text says: Comy. "Eye in itself is not old, but it has come about by former actions."<br />
					Putting aside the difficulty one will have in locating "the present moment" in time, this statement may be scientifically true but is subjectively problematic, especially for a Buddhist. Here we see it this way:<br />
					The sense organ comes into contact with the object of sense and there arises as a consequence sensation, perception, and consciousness. This "consciousness or awareness of the object of sense follows in Time, the Eye, the Object, The Contact, the Sensation and the Perception. Clearly what is subjectively experienced as a Sense Experience is the Experience of what has happened in the Past.<br />
					This is not nit picking. This is the dynamic of the error we are perpetually making here: we are continuously trying to create the Past. We experience a pleasant sensation, we would like to repeat the sensation. It can never happen. It is passed, done gone. In stead we immediately forget our disappointment that the pleasant sensation was only temporary and has gone, and, setting out to recreate it, we create a new sense experience which comes to the same end. The more we struggle, the further we get from our goal. This is <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/paticca_samuppada.htm#ps">Downbound Confounded Rebounding Conjuration.</a></p>
