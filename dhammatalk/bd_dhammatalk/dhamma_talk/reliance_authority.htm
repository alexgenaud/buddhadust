					<h1>On Reliance on Authority</h1>

					<p class="f4">... In this case some Beggar says: "Thus Have I Heard face-to-face with the Lucky Man, friends. I got this straight from him. This is The Word, this is The Discipline, this is the The Teacher's instruction."</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, beggars, what this Beggar says is neither to be accepted nor rejected, but without bias, <i>the words and syllables</i> are to be carefully examined, placed side-by-side with the Suttas, side-by-side with the Vinaya.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> If after having been placed side-by-side with the Suttas, side-by-side with the Vinaya, there is disparity and lack of agreement between what is compared with Sutta and what is compared with Vinaya, then it is fair to conclude: This is not the word of the Bhagava, that Arahant, the Number One Wide-Awakened One. This has been misheard by that Beggar. And one should reject it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face/agreement accept it</p>

					<p class="f4">An order said/disagreement/reject it<br />
					Agreement/accept it</p>

					<p class="f4">Some Monk/disagreement/ reject it<br />
					Agreement/accept it</p>

					<p class="f4">A great number of elder monks/disagreement/reject it<br />
					Agreement/accept it</p>

					<p class="f4">A single elder monk/disagreement/reject it<br />
					Agreement/accept it</p>

					<p><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Woodward footnotes: "There were evidently only two collections (baskets or pitakas) Comy. As at DA.ii, 566 attempts to prove that here Sutta = Suttanta-Abhidhamma-Pitakani. But Abhidhamma is obviously a much later collection. Had there been any pitakas at the time of the composition of this sutta the word would surely have been used in it."<br />
