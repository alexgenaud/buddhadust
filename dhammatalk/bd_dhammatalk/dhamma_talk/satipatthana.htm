					<h4 class="ctr c">Satipatthana Sutta: The Hindrances</h4>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>In <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/table_of_contents.htm">The Pali Line</a> Part II: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm">The Master Past Your Passion Pastures</a>, <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#Bindups">The Bindups</a>, you talk about the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">nivaranesu</a> or bindups. Are these the 5 Hindrances? Also, could you tell me what these 5 are in the Pali?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is now a very nice selection of materials on the Satipatthana Sutta collected together in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/idx_satipatthana_resources.htm">Satipatthana Resources</a> Section.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first answer is yes, the Nivaranas, or what I call the Bindups, are the Hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the variety of translations of the terms: Glossology: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">Nivaranas</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There is more in The Pali Line on the Bindups also here:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#Bindups">../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#Bindups</a><br />
					and here:<br />
					<a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#Bindups">../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#Bindups</a></p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kamacchanda.htm"><b>Kamacchando</b></a>: kama = pleasure (I say this is the word from which Kamma came. ka=shit, ma=mother, make; which stood for procreation, and the attached pleasure which were later split into kamma = mother's work, weaving, work, and the kamma we know as the law of action and reaction and kama as in hooker, prostitution, and sexual pleasures. And chando = wishing for. Here the word means wanting of any sort, including wanting to do good.<br />
					<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vyapada.htm"><b>Vyapado</b></a>: anger, wrath, vya the not path (a-pado)<br />
					<b>thina-middha</b>: both words for "fat" sluggish, muddleheadedness slow, stupid<br />
					<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/uddhacca-kukkucca.htm"><b>uddhacca-kukkucca</b></a>: one of my favoret words, uddha, udder, undulate, tremble; c-ca, ku, k-ku, c-ca all some kina she u know; we have the expression "shuddering-shit!" I like fear and trembling. This is not just ordinary fear, it is the fear of suddenly being faced with the end of your nice comfortable life; recollecting, as I have it, <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/pajapatis_problem.htm">Pajapati's problem</a>, which is what you were trying to escape by being born in this life to begin with. The fear of being suddenly faced with enormous power. The fear of being successful in this effort<br />
					<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vicikiccha.htm"><b>vicikiccha</b></a>: re-what?what?-stuff, doubt</p>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>Is </i>chando<i> synonomous with </i><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/tanha.htm">tanha?</a></p>

					<p class="f4">I would say Chando and Tanha were synonyms, yes. The basic meanings of the two tells you of two different ways of describing the same thing: Tanha is thirst, chando is to wish with a kind of resolution that "intends" to get. Make the sound c-ch, as in Chant, as in "incant" (that's not the same as decant, which generally leaves one without the ability to enchant, which is the intent). The other meaning is "impulse" Can you see impulse in the sound C-ch? It also means to jump [at].</p>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>Is there any difference in meaning between </i>vyapado<i> and </i>dosa?</p>

					<p class="f4">PED isn't too helpful here, although it does agree essentially with my meaning of the syllables of Vya-a-pado, they say "to go wrong" (going from vi+apajati, to undergo (vi = un, un-undergo) from aa + pad to putja pad on da padth, which is a long way around to where I started), and I think that is the distinction. Dosa is anger. Vyapado is any straying off the path which can be to become angry, or, most often have malevolence of mind, but is not restricted to that.</p>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>Could you elaborate on "fear of being successful in this effort"? The effort towards Nibbāna? Or the effort towards "enormous power"?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Both. And the effort towards <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nibbana.htm">Nibbāna</a> leads straight through the road to enormous power. It is one of the really difficult things to communicate to people. It is my contention that this system is 10% learning the method and 90% actually putting it into practice. You need to get it through your head that you have to give up <i>everything</i> here. But how hard is that, as a concept to grasp? Not very hard, it's a "one note" sort of thing. It's the Implications that are enormous. That is what is faced when one sits down and suddenly, without too much effort, finds one has suddenly seen things from a perspective that 99% of the rest of the world is missing. Suddenly that makes you one of the 1% at the top. (And, do not mistake me here, I am not talking about having made any real progress in This System at all!). Knowledge is Power. Suddenly you know that on the one hand you could drop this effort and go out with your newfound perspective and accomplish just about anything you ever dreamed of, and on the other hand you know that if you keep on going <span class="c"><b>This Way</b></span>, you may well very quickly face a situation where Nothing and Nobody here means a Tinker's Damn to you. Every feeling you have ever had for anyone or anything here is going to evaporate in a sea of indifference. You see, you are not at that moment looking at the benefits, but at all you are about to loose, and at that time your Real Grasping of this world makes itself known. How much You Really Love It Here. And then, suddenly, you think: Ogha! I may already have gone too far! That's fear and Trembling as I see it.</p>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>Is there any difference in meaning between </i>vicikiccha<i> and </i>moha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Moha is from MUH, great grandmother of Duh, stupidity, whereas even a smart fellow suchas suchas I can have perplexity about a thing, which is Vicikiccha.</p>
