					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Savatthi Town, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/01_ones/an01.248-257.olds.bd.htm#Anathapindiko">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> Park, <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove,</a> The Lucky Man came a revisiting. There, to the Beggars gathered round, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight, Beggars, are the worldly conditions that obsess the worldly; the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="ctr f4 c"><b>Gain and loss,<br />
					honor and dishonor,<br />
					praise and blame,<br />
					pleasure and pain.</b></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the eight worldly conditions, Beggars, that obsess the worldly; the eight worldly conditions around which the world revolves.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr f4 c">Gain and loss,<br />
					honor and dishonor,<br />
					praise and blame,<br />
					pleasure and pain;<br />
					impermanent, human conditions ... ending things;<br />
					things vulnerable to reversal!</p>

					<p class="ctr f4 c">Recognizing and reflecting, the wise consider these:<br />
					things vulnerable to reversal!</p>

					<p class="ctr f4 c">By the pleasant not stirred up in heart,<br />
					nor by the unpleasant repulsed,<br />
					tranquilized, gone past all that,<br />
					neither collaborating nor resisting,<br />
					walking the path free of lust, sorrowless,<br />

					<p class="f4">Eight, Beggars, are the worldly conditions that obsess the worldly, the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr f4 c"><b>Gain and loss,<br />
					honor and dishonor,<br />
					praise and blame,<br />
					pleasure and pain.</b></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the eight worldly conditions, beggars, that obsess the worldly; the eight worldly conditions around which the world revolves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars! To the uneducated common man come gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Beggars, to the well educated student of the Aristocrats come gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">So then, this being the case, what distinguishes the path of the well educated student of the Aristocrats from that of the uneducated common man?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us," said those Beggars, "the Lucky Man is the source of <i>Dhamma,</i> our guide, our protector. It would clearly be for our good, Venerable, if the Lucky Man were to explain the meaning of this; when the Beggars hear this from the Lucky Man they will retain it in mind."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Very well, then, Beggars!<br />
					Pay Attention!<br />
					Give Ear!<br />
					I will speak!<br />
					and<br />
					"Venerable!" those Beggars responded.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, Beggars, gain comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This gain is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Loss comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This loss is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Honor comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This honor is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Dishonor comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This dishonor is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Praise comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This praise is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Blame comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This blame is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasure comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This pleasure is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Pain comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This pain is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">They let gain take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let loss take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let honor take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let dishonor take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let praise take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let blame take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let pleasure take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They let pain take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are excited by the gains that arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are repulsed by the losses that arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are excited by the honors that arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are repulsed by the dishonors that arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are excited by the praise that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are repulsed by the blame that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are excited by the pleasure that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are repulsed by the pain that arises.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="in4 c f4"><b>Thus they collaborate and resist<br />
					and are in no way released from birth,<br />
					aging,<br />
					sickness and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair,<br />
					so I say.</b></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But here, Beggars, gain comes to the well educated student of the Aristocrats accompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"This gain is impermanent, inherently painful, a thing subject to reversal."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">And they really understand this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they really understand this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let gain take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let loss take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let honor take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let dishonor take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let praise take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let blame take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let pleasure take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not let pain take a lasting hold on their hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are not excited by the gains that arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are not excited by the honors that arise.</p>
