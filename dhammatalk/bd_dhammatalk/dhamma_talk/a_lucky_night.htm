					<p class="f4">The key to this formula is the line "Unfixed, Unmoveable." Living in the past, one is "fixed" for the past is unchangeable; living in anticipation of the future, one is constantly at the mercy of change. So it is only while seeing things in the here and now as they really are, and that while doing one's various duties, that learning and understanding can be used to cultivate the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is one of a number of suttas which are given by multiple individuals, sometimes (as in this case) in differing forms. In the first case the Buddha's explanation is that living in the past, anticipating the future, and being defeated with regard to the present is a matter of identification with the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panc_upadana_kkhandha.htm">kkhandhas</a>. <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/maha_kaccana.htm">Maha Kaccana</a>'s version describes the three in terms of the consciousness of the individual being bound up in the six senses (the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/salayatana.htm">salayatana</a>) and taking delight in them and, with regard to the present, taking action on desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">I think it's fair to say that one who lives unfixed, unmoveable and undefeated in any of these ways can be said to be having a Lucky Day, any day he is living like this.</p>
