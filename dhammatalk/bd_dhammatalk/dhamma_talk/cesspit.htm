									<p>Important Note: The tendency here is going to be to read the first two or three lines and skip to the end. Resist that tendency. Read, if you are going to read this, <i>S-L-O-W-L-Y;</i> and visualize what is being described; but better than reading it to yourself would be reciting it out loud, also slowly ... wait after each line until you feel the issue has penetrated through and you are ready to handle a new cycle ...; even better would be to recite this to someone else. If you do decide to recite this to others, do so after you have explained how what they are to be doing is to make a small meditation out of each phrase ... and, again, deliver it slowly, watching for the notion that 'this is just boring!' to pass off. This is deeply powerful if done properly. This little spell which can be read in a minute should take hours, even days, to deliver.</p>

					put it away, and<br />
					disassociate himself<br />
					from body;<br />
					putting away desire for body,<br />
					disassociating himself from body,<br />
					he becomes free from body and<br />
					to this extent<br />
					he has become cool and<br />
					has attained a taste of <i>Nibbāna</i><br />
					in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, beggars,<br />
					train yourselves this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall look upon the body<br />
					as a cesspit,<br />
					putting away lust for bodies,<br />
					disassociating ourselves<br />
					from body.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way to train yourselves,<br />
					say I.</p>
