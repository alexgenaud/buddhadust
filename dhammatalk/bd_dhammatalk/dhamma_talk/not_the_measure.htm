					<p class="f4">This is not "The Measure of My Life."</p>

					<p class="f4">Is what I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say: This Body is not the Measure of My Life,<br />
					This ability to see sights with the Eye<br />
					This ability to hear sounds with the Ear<br />
					This ability to smell scents with the Nose<br />
					This ability to taste savours with the Tongue<br />
					to feel touch with the Body<br />
					is not the Measure of My Life,<br />
					These experiences of pain and pleasure and not painful but not pleasant sense experiences arising from contact of sense organ with sense object are not the Measure of My Life<br />
					These perceptions of sight, sound, scent, taste, touch and thought<br />
					This conjuring of a world of my own making<br />
					This conscious awareness of knowing knowing is not the Measure of My Life."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">I look at a "Lucky Bamboo" I have purchased in the local enlightenment bookstore,<br />
					$2.95.<br />
					Certified Organic.<br />
					I have planted it.<br />
					I jesture towards the one-link, one-leaf plant: "I will take this as the measure of my life; as this bamboo lives, I live, as it dies, I die."<br />
					Would anyone in their right mind take such a vow?<br />
					Would anyone fix one's time here on an object so completely out of one's control?<br />
					No Way!</p>

					<p class="f4">In exactly the same way: "This is not The Measure of My Life."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f3"><b>Epilogue</b></p>

					<p class="f4">That "Lucky Bamboo" has been dead now for so long that I don't even remember when it died.</p>
