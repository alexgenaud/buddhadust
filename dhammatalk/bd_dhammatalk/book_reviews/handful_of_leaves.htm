					<p class="ctr">Print edition of Thanissaro Bhikkhu's sutta translations</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">A print edition of Thanissaro Bhikkhu's sutta translations is available in a four-volume book entitled, <b><span class="c">Handful of Leaves.</span></b> available free of charge upon request from:</p>

					&nbsp;<br />

					<p class="f4"><b>Ajaan Thanissaro</b> (Geoffrey DeGraff) has been a Theravadin monk since 1976. He is currently the abbot of Metta Forest Monastery, a combined monastic and lay meditation community in San Diego County. He is the author of <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/index.html">Mind Like Fire Unbound</a>, and the translator of many Thai meditation guides and selections from the Pali Canon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Readers will know Bhikkhu Thanissaro's work from his numerous translations on <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org">Access to Insight</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what it's worth, (and he might not appreciate the comparison), I consider this Bhikkhu's translations as the closest ones out there to the method being suggested here. This both from the point of view of what he does say and from the point of view of what he does not say.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have given a quick look-see to the Sati Centers website and note that they request donations. This is not exactly as pure a form of maintaining one's existence as a distributor of the Dhamma as is found, say, on Access to Insight, (I find it hard to imagine being able to ask for one of these books without sending a donation) but in theory at least they are not selling the Dhamma. I suggest making as generous a contribution as you can afford.</p>
