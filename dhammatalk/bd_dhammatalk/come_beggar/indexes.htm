					<hr />

					<p class="f4">There are several ways to look up information on this site.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <a href="../../../dhammatalk/method/dhamma-vicaya.htm"><b><i>Dhamma-Vicaya</i> Page</b></a> provides an access point to what could be called the themes of Buddhist study. This includes introductory courses (there are several), an encapsulated version of the beginning part of 'The <i>Pāḷi</i> Line' (a comprehensive introduction to the system) in graphic form, several sections dealing with major suttas that have almost reached "school" status, and there are, on this page, links to all the other sections on this site.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/idx_index.htm"><b>Index of Indexes</b></a> provides a Table of Contents to formal Indexes of which there are several:</p>

					<p class="f4">A <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm"><b>Sutta Index</b></a> which lists every sutta of the <i>Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya,</i> and <i>Samyutta Nikaya</i> providing information as to where information can be found for the original <i>Pāḷi,</i> for translations found in the Wisdom Publications books, the <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society translations, the <i>Pāḷi,</i> translations and discussions to be found on Buddhadust and elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/idx_personalities.htm"><b>Index of Proper Names</b></a> This is an Index to the names of the "Pre-eminant Ones" named in the Book of the Ones. Good, thorough biographies of each of the major characters to be found in the suttas compiled from the <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society's Dictionary of <i>Pāḷi</i> Proper Names and Psalms of the Sisters and other sources.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossologytoc.htm"><b>The Glossology.</b></a> Now in a reasonably mature state this is in the form of a subject index / glossary / comparative vocabulary. Major concepts link to the individual terms used in those concepts, individual terms link back to the major terms of which they are components, and both link to locations on this site where those terms are used. Tables of the translations of most well-known translators are given, and there are examples, definitions, references and discussions also included. In turn links throughout this site connect to these terms. This is a central tool for presenting the 'take' given here while at the same time providing resources for the student to compare with other translators and judge for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm"><b>Buddha's India</b>.</a> This index, map and information sheet contains information on the geography of "The Middle Country"; India at the Time of the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>The Garden of Eden</b>. Only in bare-bones shape at this time, this should be a section similar to Buddha's India, only this one for the flora and Fauna mentioned in the suttas.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/links/links.htm"><b>The Links Page</b></a> This is more than just a bunch of links. This is a carefully researched set of descriptions of and links to the most useful websites on early Buddhism out there.</p>
