					<h1>Ratthapalas Faith</h1>

					<p>Ratthapala was named #1 of those who became homeless out of faith. <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/ratthapalo.htm">Ratthapala's Story</a>.</p>

					<p>This is what he described as the 4 Teachings of the Buddha that he knew and saw for himself, that resulted in him in such faith:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="mozp"><b>1. Upanīyati loko addhuvo</b></p>

					<p>Upanīyati: (MOZ PALI: UP PASS DOWN WHATSOEVER THIS; brought to; come to; brought to conclusion, end loko= (you know loco, no?) = location, World; locus a concentration; where beings tend to be reborn, here I am taking this to mean the World in the broadest sense: existing as any kind of a being in any kind of a world; addhuvo = not-true, unstable,</p>

					<p><b>The World is fake, it comes to an End.</b></p>

					<p>The meaning is explained by Ratthapala by way of the example of the fading away of one's abilities with age.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="mozp"><b>2. Attāṇo loko anabhissaro</b></p>

					<p>Attāṇno: as regards the self; anabhissaro: PED: only here an, without (abhi + issara) lord or protector.</p>

					<p><b>There is no protector of the self in the World.</b></p>

					<p>The meaning is explained by Ratthapala by way of one's inability to protect one's self from sickness.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="mozp"><b>3. Assako loko sabbaŋ pahāya gamanīyan</b></p>

					<p>Assako: not owned by; sabbaŋ: all;
					gamanīyan: done gone.</p>

					<p><b>The World is not to be owned, everything is taken back.</b> You can't take it with you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="mozp"><b>4. Ūno loko atitto taṇhādāso</b></p>

					<p>Ūno: (PED: Lat. vanus, Goth. wans, Anglo Saxon, won = English want) wanting, deficient;<br />
					atitto: a + titto; finished, satiated;<br />
					taṇhādāso: you know tanha, hunger/thirst.</p>

					<p><b>The wanting of the World is an unslakable thirst.</b></p>

					<p>The meaning is explained by Ratthapala by way of showing that a king always hungers for conquest.</p>
