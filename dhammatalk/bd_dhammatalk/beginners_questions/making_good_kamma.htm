					<h1>Making Good Kamma</h1>

					<p class="f4"><i>Tini puñña-kiriya-vatthūni: Dāna- (sīla-, bhāvanā-) mayaṃ puñña-kiriya-vatthū.</i></p>

					<h4>Three Bases for the Expectation of Benefit<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></h4>

					<p class="f4">The expectation of benefit based on <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dana.htm">making gifts,</a> <i>(dana)</i>,<br />
					the expectation of benefit based on <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sila.htm">ethical behavior,</a> <i>(sila)</i>, and<br />
					the expectation of benefit based on <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/bhava.htm">self-improvement,</a> <i>(bhava).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I take the meaning here to be the grounds on which one can reasonably expect to have created some future benefit — aka good <i>kamma.</i><br />
					Rhys Davids has "Three bases by merit accomplished, to wit, the bases composed of giving, of virtue, of study.";<br />
					Walshe has "grounds based on merit" meaning the same thing as Rhys Davids.</p>

					<p class="f4">What's the difference?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first case the statement is that because one has done one or another of these types of deeds, one has a basis for expecting some future benefit;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of Rhys Davids and Walshe, the statement is that one has created a basis for something unspecified by way of the merit of one or another of these deeds. I don't think that is the intent of the original nor, actually of Rhys Davids or Walshe. If we had a follow-up statement to the effect that by means of this bases states of further accomplishment might be gained, then this construction would make sense.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Puñña:</i> PED: favorable, good, merit, meritorious action, virtue...always represented as foundation and condition of heavenly rebirth and a future blissful state.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Kiriya:</i> PED: 1A. action, performance, deed; the doing = fulfillment. (MO: Often apparently serving the function of turning another word into one meaning the act of doing that: <i>kusala</i>- performance; <i>dana-</i> bestowing; <i>papa-</i> commission; <i>mangala-</i> celebration; <i>sacchi-</i> realization); B. an act in a special sense = promise, vow, dedication, intention, pledge; C. philosophically: action ineffective as to result, non-causative, an action which ends in itself; 2. making no difference, indefinite; of no result; indifferent, neither good nor bad and having no fruit of <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Vatthū.</i> PED: lit. "ground," hence 1. (lit) object, real thing, property, thing, substance; (applied meaning) object, item; 3. occasion for, reason, ground</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/bhava.htm"><i>Bhāvanā.</i></a> Becoming, Development, — I think Walshe's "meditation," and Rhys Davids' "study" for <i>"bhavana"</i> are cases of what is being developed, but the word is more general and probably intended to be inclusive of all forms of development or self-development = becoming; or in the other sense of the word "living" meaning manner of living.</p>
