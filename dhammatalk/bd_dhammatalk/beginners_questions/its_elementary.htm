					<h4>Suttas Connected to Analysis of Elementary Data<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></h4>

					<p class="f4">Outline (This is a fairly long "spell", and a good example of why these suttas should not be abbreviated...there is no place out there where this one is "spelled out" completely, and the latter half is very easy to ignore, but it is very big medicine.)</p>

					<p class="f4">Data; element: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/maha_dhatu.htm"><i>Dhatu</i></a><br />
					Diversity; different, differentiation: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nanatta.htm"><i>Nanatta</i></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Dhatu: The Different Data:</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye, Visible Object, Eye-consciousness<br />
					Ear, Sounds, Hearing-consciousness<br />
					Nose, Scents, Smelling-consciousness<br />
					Tongue, Tastes, Tasting-consciousness<br />
					Body, Touch, body-consciousness<br />
					Mind, Ideas (Dhammas), Mental Consciousness</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the different data.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/phassa.htm">Samphassa</a>: Own-touch</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>dhātunānattam paṭicca uppajjati phassananattam</i><br />
					data-diversity rebound-a to-up-born touch-diversity</p>

					<p class="f4">Different data give rise to differing touches. Or:<br />
					Because there are differing data, there is differentiated contact. Or:<br />
					The upshot of the percussion of differing data is differing touch.<br />
					Horner: Because of the diversity in elements, brethren, arises diversity of contact.<br />
					Bodhi: Bhikkhus, it is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises diversity of contacts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye contact becomes, rebounding off eye-data. Or:<br />
					The upshot of eye-data-percussion is eye touch...etc.<br />
					Ear contact becomes, rebounding off ear-data<br />
					Nose contact becomes, rebounding off nose-data<br />
					Tongue contact becomes, rebounding off tongue-data<br />
					Body contact becomes, rebounding off body-data<br />
					Mind contact becomes, rebounding off mind-data</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>No ce tam:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Get it straight. As simple and straight-forward as this may seem, it is of absolutely vital importance when it comes to the way the ordinary common man's "sub-conscious" perceives the world and the self, which is exactly the other way around, that is: "Because I exist, the diversity of elements exists."<br />
					[It's 'because of the diversity of thought-data percussing the mind that there is the appearance of a thinking being; not that because of a thinking being there is the diversity of thought data.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Unless the reader is very unusual, he will be thinking: 'But this <i>is</i> how I see this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the difference: the ordinary common man understands that 'different data give rise to differing touches' as a matter of conforming to the 'world' view of how things are. He thinks this is how he thinks because he identifies with thinking in words, not 'seeing' how he thinks by inference from how he behaves.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person would be considered mad here to be running around saying 'Because I see, things exist.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But what reveals his unconscious thinking — his true way of seeing things, is how he behaves, which is contrary to the way he would behave if he really believed that 'different data give rise to differing touches' was the reality: he is <i>upset</i> when he does not see, hear, smell, taste, touch, or think what <i>he</i> wants, as if there should be some power over these functions vested in him. His more sophisticated behaviors are built on these initial fundamental reactions, and so on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting a grip on the way it really is is one of the fundamental building blocks to an understanding of 'Not Self'.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Dhātunānattaṃ paṭicca uppajjati phassanānattam//<br />

					<p class="f4">Data-diversity rebound to upborn touch-diversity//<br />
					not touch-diversity rebound to upborn data-diversity// //</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of the diversity in elements that there is differentiated contact;<br />
					it is not because of the diversity of contacts (for example eye concocting visible object, ear concocting sound, etc) that there is a diversity of elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the order in which it happens.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vedana: Experience, Sense Experience, Feeling</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Dhātunānattaṃ paṭicca uppajjati phassanānattam<br />

					touch-diversity rebound-a to-up-born sense-experience diversity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Different data produce the appearance of differing touches.<br />
					Different touches produce the appearance of differing sense experiences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye-data rebounds born as eye-touch<br />
					eye-touch rebounds born as eye-sense experience</p>

					<p class="f4">Different touches do not arise as a consequence of different sense experiences<br />
					Different data do not arise as a consequence of different touches.</p>

					<p class="f4">The previous dealt with the matter from the starting point of the eye which is known as an "internal" element, so that section is said to have dealt with the issue from the point of view of the personal.</p>

					<p class="f4">The following is the same issue stated from the point of view of the "external".</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the diversity of data:</p>

					<p class="f4">Visible-object data<br />
					Sound-data<br />
					Scent-data<br />
					Taste-data<br />
					Touch-data<br />
					Idea-data</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Bodhi: "intentions".</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of different principles, different wishes (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/chanda.htm"><i>chanda</i></a>)<br />
					Because of different wishes, different passions (<i>pari'āha.</i>)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Because of different passions, different satisfaction-seeking<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And again, but <i>even more important</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not the difference in satisfaction seeking that leads to different passions;<br />

					<p class="f4">Contact:</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of differing satisfaction-seekings, differing outcomes.</p>

					<h4>Seven data-sets:</h4>

					<p class="f4">Light<br />
					Beauty<br />
					Limitless Space<br />
					Limitless Consciousness<br />
					No-Thing<br />
					Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception<br />
					The Ending of Perception and Sense Experience</p>

					<p class="f4">The Light element is made known by darkness<br />
					The beauty element is made known by repulsivity<br />
					Limitless Space is made known by objects<br />
					Limitless Consciousness is made known by Limitless Space<br />
					No-Thing(ness) is made known by Limitless Consciousness<br />
					Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception is made known by No-Thing(ness)<br />
					The Ending of Perception and Sense Experience is made known by Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Directly knowing the light, beauty, limitless space, limitless consciousness, and no-thing elements is accomplished through sharpened perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Directly knowing the neither-perception-nor-non-perception element is attained by<br />
					<i>saŋkhārāvasesasamāpatti<br />
					saŋkhāra avasesa samāpatti</i><br />
					confounding-remaining-attainment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Bodhi: "an attainment with a residue of formations"<br />
					Rhys Davids: "by attainment in the remaining activities of mind"</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Bodhi takes his meaning from Buddhaghossa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We do have the formula for arriving at this stage elsewhere in the letting go of the Realm of No-Thing There. We also know that even this high jhana is said to be "sankaramed", so I do not see why we should think of the sankhara here as anything other than what it usually is: the intentional act of creating the personal experience of a thing and the outcome of that action. And I would just leave it at that.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sphere of the Ending of Perception and Sense Experience is directly known through the attaining of "ending".</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeking cruel satisfaction the untamed, untrained, uneducated common man performs low acts of body, speech, and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as if a man were to throw down a lit torch in a dry-grass waste. If he were not to act quickly to extinguish that torch, the resulting fire would destroy the lives of all those creatures living in that wasteland.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way any shaman or brahmin who does not quickly extinguish thoughts of lust, anger and cruelty will soon be seen to be acting badly here with aggravation, trouble and despair to follow and at the break up of the body at death he will find consciousness again in some no-good rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeking non-cruelty satisfaction the well-tamed, well-trained, well-educated student of the aristocrats acts well in body, speech, and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as if a man were to throw down a lit torch in a dry-grass waste but were to quickly extinguish it. The creatures living in that dry-grass waste would not come to harm because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way any shaman or Brahman who quickly extinguished thoughts of lust, harm and cruelty will not be seen to act badly here or suffer aggravation, trouble and despair as a consequence, and at the breakup of the body at death he will find consciousness again in some happy condition.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kaccayana asks: "How is it that the view arises of one who is not Consummately Self-Awakened that he is consummately self-awakened?"</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the mighty blindness data.</p>

					<p class="f4">Data can be classified as low, middling, and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Travelling through (as it were) the low data-strata are low perceptions, low views, low thoughts, low-mindedness, low pasturage, resolve, low people, and low talk; low is what is declared, preached, made-known, made food for thought, revealed, analyzed, and made manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Travelling through the middling data-strata are middling perceptions, middling views, middling thoughts, middling mindedness, middling pasturage, middling resolve, middling people, and middling talk; middling is what is declared, preached, made known, made food for thought, revealed, analyzed and made manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Travelling through the high data-strata are high perceptions, high views, high thoughts, high mindedness, high Satisfying Pastures, high resolve, high people, and high talk; high is what is declared, preached, made known, made food for thought, revealed, analyzed and made manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birds of a feather:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through a data-strata in common, beggars, that beings meet and flow on together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beings of low tastes (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/muta.htm">muta</a>, the intuitive senses associated with taste, touch and smell) meet with and flow on together with other beings of low tastes.</p>
