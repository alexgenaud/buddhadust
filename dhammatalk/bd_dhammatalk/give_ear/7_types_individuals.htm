					<h1>The Seven Types of Individuals</h1>

					<p class="f4">Some interesting issues are clarified in this sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha asks: "Do you understand me to have taught: Whatever <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vedana.htm">sense experience</a> (pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant) one experiences, unskilled states decline, skilled states grow?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what you have understood is that I have taught: When one experiences one sort of pleasant, unpleasant, neither pleasant nor unpleasant sense experience unskilled states grow and skilled states decline; but for one experiencing sense experience of another kind unskilled states decrease and skilled states increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Nanamoli/Bodhi<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> [N/B] cite MA: "This statement is made with pointed reference to pleasure experienced in eating a night meal, which does not conduce to the practice of a monk's duties."</p>

					<p class="f4">While the context of the sutta would appear to confirm this, I believe the deeper reference is to the idea of sense experience downbound to the world versus sense experience connected to letting go.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I can't see the sense experience connected with eating that would conduce to unskilled states decreasing and skilled states increasing unless it were connected to the "once-removed" sort that is not downbound to the world (i.e., having experienced a pleasant sensation at the tongue he is aware of the danger, sees it as transitory, and let's it go thereby experiencing a pleasant sense experience, at the tongue, not downbound to the world; noticing the benefits, good states increase and bad states decrease.)</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe this is confirmed by the logic of the rest of the sutta which deals with the various forms of attainment. The logic being that what is a problem for one level is not necessarily a problem for another level. Note <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.066.than.ati.htm">MN #66</a>, The Simile of the Quail:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Horner: "... it is like a man, poor, needy, destitute, who has one little tumbledown hovel, open to the crows, unlovely to see, one tumbledown pallet, unlovely to see, his grain and store-room in one jar, unlovely to see, his one wife unlovely to see. (he might think of becoming a homeless bhikkhu) . . . but he might not be able to bring himself to give up his one little tumbledown hovel ...<br />
					(But) ... it is like a householder or his son, rich, of great wealth, of great possessions, with a mass of abundant gold ornaments, a mass of abundant corn, a mass of abundant fields, with a mass of abundant raiment, with a mass of abundant wives, a mass of abundant men slaves, a mass of abundant women slaves. (he might think of becoming a homeless bhikkhu) . . . and he might be able to bring himself to give up his mass of abundant gold ornaments ..."</p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to the rules of training and ethical conduct, it is not that the advanced Bhikkhu is permitted to do what a trainee is not permitted to do, it is that he has seen the benefit of the rules and has already integrated such behaviors into his lifestyle, so following rules is not an issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">So here the Buddha says:</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not say of all Bhikkhus either that there is or is not need for diligent (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/appamada.htm"><i>appamadena</i></a>) work.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="two_ways"><b>1. Two-Ways Freed</b></a> <i>ubhatobhāgavimutto</i><br />
					This individual has nothing more to do.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>ubhato:</i> PED: both, two-fold, in both (or two) ways, on both sides<br />
					bhaga: lucky (well)<br />
					vimutto: Freed</p>

					<p class="fp4 in2"><i>Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo ye te santā vimokhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā te kāyena phassitvā viharati, paññāya c'assa disvā āsavā parikkhīṇā honti.</i></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Horner: "...abiding, having apprehended with the person those peaceful deliverances which are incorporeal having transcended material shapes; and having seen by means of wisdom his cankers are utterly destroyed."</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">N/B: "...contacts with the body and abides in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">(Two pretty different takes.)</p>

					<p class="f4">This Man lives (<i>viharati;</i> resides) having reached (<i>phassitvā</i>: touched) in this body (<i>kāyena</i>) the immaterial peaceful liberations beyond the material,(<i>santā vimokhā atikamma rūpe āruppā</i>)(<i>atikkamma;</i> ati= et, and, yet, but, at but, adverb and preposition of direction (forward motion) in primary meaning "on and further"; moz pali = to at this; <i>kamma</i> = make) having by seeing and wisdom destroyed his <i>āsavas (paññāya c'assa disvā āsavā parikkhīṇā honti</i>).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This man lives having reached while living in this body the immaterial peaceful liberations beyond the material and having, by seeing and wisdom, destroyed his asavas.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>The "Immaterial Peaceful <a id="liberations">Liberations</a></b>"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">1. Possessing form, one sees forms. <br />
					2. Not perceiving material forms in oneself, one sees them outside<br />
					3. Thinking: "It is beautiful", one becomes intent on it.<br />
					4. The Realm of Space<br />
					5. The Realm of Consciousness<br />
					6. The Realm of No Thing There<br />
					7. The Realm of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception<br />
					8. The Ending of Perception and Sense Experience</p>

					<p class="f4">Given the definition of the "Immaterial Peaceful Liberations" of the Digha, these "Immaterial Peaceful Liberations" are not in and of themselves the actual freedom of the Arahant. In other words, that "in addition" to destroying his Āsavas, this "Two Ways" Freed Arahant enjoys the liberations associated with these immaterial states. (see next)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> One might say he had both unworldly and worldly freedom. How does #1 fit in with the idea of 'immaterial'?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="wisdom"><b>2. Wisdom-Freed</b></a> <i>Paññāvimutto</i><br />

					<p class="fp4 in2"><i>Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo ye te santā vimokhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā te na kāyena phassitvā viharati, paññāya c'assa disvā āsavā parikkhīṇā honti.</i></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">N/B: Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">This man lives not having reached while living in this body the immaterial peaceful liberations beyond the material but has, by seeing and wisdom, destroyed his <i>asavas</i>. I take this as confirmation that the immaterial peaceful liberations are not required for attaining arahantship. One Arahant enjoys the ultimate freedom; another enjoys the ultimate freedom plus a bunch of freedoms in this world during his time left.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="body_seer"><b>3. Body Seer</b></a> <i>kāyasakkhī</i><br />

					<p class="f4"><i>kaya</i>=body; <i>sakkhi:</i> ped (sa=one, own; akkhin = eye (&gt;<i>cakkhu</i>); Latin: oculus) with his own eyes; eye-witness</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting a good translation for this one is not easy: This fellow is not a "Seer of Body" because, if anything he has overcome body. "Body Witness" is exact, but does not mean anything to me. The translation given here means that he sees and understands liberation through his having attained the peaceful deliverances which are bodily. He sees liberation only through the medium of body; he is not yet completely free in mind. "Mental realizer" is completely incomprehensible to me and seems to be wrong ... um ... both ways.</p>

					<p class="fp4 in2"><i>Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco puggalo ye te santā vimokhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā te kāyena phassitvā viharati, paññāya c'assa disvā ekacce āsavā parikkhīṇā honti.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Following the logic of the discussion above, this individual having attained the immaterial liberations, has through that means broken and/or weakened his <i>asavas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>vodiṭṭhā</i>= vo= Moz Pali=very old Pali=va=go &gt; vya, vi; PED: vi+ava (PED note under ava: phonetically the difference between ava and o is this, that ava is the older form, whereas o represents a later development (MO: this depends on a theory of the formation of sounds that relies on A being the first sound). Historically the case is often reversed (MO: which may indicate to some that in other evolutions of the world system another sound — "O" — might have been the first sound) — that is, the form in o was in use first and the form in ava was built up, sometimes quite independently, long afterwards.) indicating down and away. dittha: having seen a thing as it really is, as opposed to ditthi, theoretical understanding. Got this down.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>vocaritā</i>= again <i>vo</i>= <i>vi</i>; + <i>ocarati</i>=(o+carati) to be after something, to go into, to search, reconnoiter, investigate, pry; <i>carati</i>=to move about, to "live and move" to behave, to be (remember vicara)</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Horner: (won to view): As to this, monks, some person is abiding without having apprehended with the person those peaceful deliverances which are incorporeal having transcended material shapes; yet, having seen by means of wisdom some of his cankers are utterly destroyed, and those things proclaimed by the Tathāgata are fully seen by him through intuitive wisdom and fully practiced.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">N/B (attained-to-view): Here some person does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but some of his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, and he has reviewed and examined with wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">This man lives not having reached while living in this body the immaterial peaceful liberations beyond the material but has, by seeing and wisdom, destroyed some of his asavas. The Tathāgata's Dhamma-sayings are wisely understood and practiced by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This man lives not having reached while living in this body the immaterial peaceful liberations beyond the material but has, by seeing and wisdom, destroyed some of his asavas. The Tathāgata is where he has placed his heart, settled in, planted root and found his footing.</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what more remains to be done through diligence?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the Buddha makes the point that what he does not say is that <i>aññāradhanaṃ</i> is achieved ādiken, and that <i>api</i> he does say that omniscience is got by way of <i>anupubbasikkhā, anupubbakiriyā </i>and<i> anupubbapaṭipadā.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>aññāradhanaṃ: aññā</i> = omniscience, the Buddhist concept not being that one sees all all the time, but that one knows whatever one wishes to know, whenever one wishes to know it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>adika:</i> "get-go"; "right off-the-bat"; <i>ādi</i> = starting point (MOZ PALI: at this), initially, beginning, first, principal, chief + KA.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>api:</i> (Moz Pali: to up here) close by; prep. "towards, to, on to, on" and as adv. "later, and, moreover" An important little word. Horner has: "nevertheless" while Nanamoli/Bodhi have: "On the contrary". Here I think N/B have been persuaded by their inclinations. It is "scripture" in Theravada that there is no such thing as "sudden enlightenment". I think this is not supported by the Suttas where we find numerous cases of individuals becoming Arahant while listening to a discourse. The intent of this statement here by the Buddha is, I believe, to say that sudden enlightenment is not the <i>only</i> way <i>aññā</i> is arrived at. This is important to avoid the mental state of anxiously awaiting (seeking after) "the moment" of enlightenment; something that is found in the Zen schools of Buddhism. If I say: "I do not say X is got by Y; and I do say X is got by Z" that does not mean that I say X is NOT got by Y and <i>must</i> be got by Z." On the other hand! I do recall a simile in which it is said that like the joining of the shore with the sea, the meeting is gradual, with no steep precipices (which is not a fact).</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><i>So the case should probably be that even if <i>aññā</i> were attained suddenly, it would still have progressed through the various stages set out below.</i></b></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Anupubba:</i> PED: (ANU=Gr. along, up; Lat: an; along, (a) the motion viewed from the front backward: after, behind; + PUBBA = (Idg: per; Goth. fram = from; Gr. first; As: formo, first; Ohg: fro, Lord, frouwa = Ger. frau;) having been before; before, earlier): following in one's turn, successive, gradual, by and by, regular, in course of time, later, gradually. Progressive</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sikkha:</i> seeking, learning, training, studying<br />
					<i>Kiriya:</i> action, performance, deed, doing<br />
					<i>Patipada:</i> means of reaching a goal or destination, path, way, means, method, mode of progress</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the Progressive Study, Doing, Path is:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Saddhājāto upasaṇkamati</i><br />

					having Taken a Stand, with wisdom and focused vision, he sees and he realizes even in this body the highest truth..</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Horner: I, monks, do not say that the attainment of profound knowledge comes straightaway; nevertheless, monks, the attainment of profound knowledge comes by a gradual training, a gradual doing, a gradual course. And how, monks, does the attainment of profound knowledge come by means of a gradual training, a gradual doing, a gradual course? As to this, monks, one who has faith draws close; drawing close, he sits down near by; sitting down near by he lends ear; lending ear he hears Dhamma; having heard Dhamma he remembers it; he tests the meaning of the things he has born in mind; while testing the meaning the things are approved of; there being approval of the things desire is born; with desire born he makes an effort; having made the effort he weighs it up; having weighed it up he strives; being self-resolute he realizes with his person the highest truth itself and, penetrating it by means of wisdom, he sees.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">N/B: "Bhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is achieved all at once. On the contrary, final knowledge is achieved by gradual training, by gradual practice, by gradual progress.<br />
					And how does there come to be gradual training, gradual practice, gradual progress? Here one who has faith (in a teacher) pays respect to him, he gives ear; one who gives ear hears the Dhamma; having heard the Dhamma, he memorizes it; he examines the meaning of the teachings he has memorized; when he examines their meaning, he gains a reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings, zeal springs up in him; when zeal has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he scrutinizes; having scrutinized, he strives; resolutely striving, he realizes with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not say, Beggars, that omniscience is attained just like that (snap fingers); what I do say is that omniscience is attained by a Progressive Seeking, a Progressive Practice, a Progressive Method. And how is there a progressive seeking, a progressive practice, a progressive method? Here, Beggars, born of faith, approach; from approach, sitting attentively; from sitting attentively, listening carefully; from careful listening, hearing Dhamma; from hearing Dhamma, retaining; having retained Dhamma, he investigates; as he investigates Dhamma he comes to understanding and acceptance; reflecting on understanding and acceptance, Intent is born; with the birth of Intent, Receptivity; with Receptivity, Weighing; with Weighing, Taking a Stand; having Taken a Stand, with wisdom and focused vision, he sees and he realizes even in this body the highest truth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> When the Buddha says something like "There are these seven individuals found in the world" (as here), this should not be interpreted as meaning that this is an exclusive or inclusive list. As seen in the case of the Gradual Sayings, it means more like "There is this group of 7 and there can be this other group of 7, etc." However this group is important and referenced often. The context here, as indicated above, is to delineate those who have nothing more to do and those who have more to do.</p>
