					<h1>Adam's Apple</h1>

					<p class="f4">This is notice that there is a section here called "Adam's Apple." This is in the form of an exercise and there will be no explanatory text. (This is something you should do, or observe, but not ask questions about — this is about getting that mind there to do some work on it's own.) In it's current state the project is sufficiently finished to allow those interested to begin the exercise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The section is deliberately buried deeply in the site and the entrance is not easy to locate while casually browsing. This is for two reasons: 1. Not everyone will immediately see the relevance of this material to the study of what the Buddha taught, and 2. The entire section is graphics intensive and almost every page will amount to a slow download for those with slow modems: be prepared!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an exercise in the magic power known as <a  href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#NIRUTTI">Nirutti</a>. Please be advised that this is a controversial topic and even in its "Academic" form produces an unusual amount of hostility/denial. Do it if you wish, but take care when speaking about it to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a magic power this preceded the Buddha, but as it is set up here, this will help you understand the Pali and what the Buddha taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">The structure is in three parts: <a  href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/adams_apple/americanpictogramtitle.htm">Construction of letters</a>;<br />
					<a  href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/adams_apple/old_pali/oldpalititlepage.htm">Old Pali</a> (the exercise proper);<br />
					<a  href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/bag/nidana/nidana_gallery.htm">The Little Magic Kitbag</a> as it is now available from the Home page.</p>
