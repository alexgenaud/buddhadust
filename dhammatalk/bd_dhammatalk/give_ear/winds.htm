					<h1>Winds in the Upper Atmosphere<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></h1>

					<p class="f4">There are Winds in the Upper Atmosphere, Beggars,<br />
					that will tear some Small Bird that wanders there<br />
					limb from limb<br />
					in the same way as a hurricane can ...<br />
					so that <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#BareUnconnectedBones">here</a> is a wing,<br />
					here the breast bones,<br />
					there a foot,<br />
					there the tail feathers<br />
					and there also, the head.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Beggars,<br />
					some Beggar here,<br />
					setting out on his trek for food,<br />
					not having enveloped himself in Satisfaction,<br />
					without having set a guard<br />
					at the doors of the senses,<br />
					wanders into town<br />
					and there,<br />
					having dressed recklessly in the morning,<br />
					with her blouse<br />
					incompletely protecting her charms from view,<br />
					laughing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and dancing at some gathering place,<br />
					is The Fairest Lass In the Land.</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, Beggars,<br />
					The Fairest Lass In the Land:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">She is not too tall.<br />
					She is not too short.<br />
					She is not too dark.<br />
					She is not too pale.<br />
					She is not too fat.<br />
					She is not too thin.<br />
					She is not overly busty.<br />
					She is not underly busty.<br />
					Her thighs are warm in the winter,<br />
					Cool in the summer.<br />
					She is just 16,<br />
					In the very first flower of her youth,<br />
					With a Beauty just touching on the Devine<br />
					... soft is the touch of the down<br />
					on the arms<br />
					of The Fairest Lass In the Land.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Then imagine, Beggars,<br />
					the din and clamor of the throng<br />
					as she laughs, and sings, and dances,<br />
					displaying her youthful charms.</p>

					<div class="floatl" style="width: 100px; padding: 6px;">
					<p><img src="../../../resources/images/bhk.bowl.profile.jpg" width="100" height="122" alt="with his bowl brim-full-up" /></p>
					</div>

					<p class="f4 in2">And then imagine, Beggars,<br />
					that beggar as he comes along,<br />
					with his bowl brim full up<br />
					and Mara,<br />
					track'n close behind,<br />
					with sword uplifted,<br />
					tell'n 'im:</p>

					<p class="f4">&quot;That's the way, Man,<br />
					carry on that way!<br />
					But remember!<br />
					Spill even onesoma drop-a apo liquid<br />
					from that brim full upsoma bowl there ...<br />
					and it's off with your head!&quot;</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Beggars?<br />
					Would that lass,<br />
					seeing that,<br />
					not laugh, and sing, and dance<br />
					with even greater abandon?</p>

					<p class="f4">And that Beggar, Beggars,<br />
					not having enveloped himself in satisfaction,<br />
					not having set a guard<br />
					at the door of the senses,<br />
					is torn apart with lust there and then,<br />
					and returning to his hut,<br />
					he renounces the training<br />
					and returns to the lower life.<br />
					... and one here gets his kit bag,<br />
					and one gets his strainer,<br />
					and one his robes,<br />
					and he also, his bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Beggars:<br />
					train yourselves this way:<br />
					&quot;We shall envelope ourselves in satisfaction,<br />
					and set a guard<br />
					at the doors of the senses,<br />
					and not let lust<br />
					get a hold on our hearts!&quot;</p>
