					<p class="f4">The thing you want to do with these sorts of stutas ... reading them isn't going to help very much ... is first to study them and see if you can picture the sequence involved (which is best done by understanding it) and then do the sequence in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">After the Nidana -- <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Savatthi</a> town, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/01_ones/an01.248-257.olds.bd.htm#Anathapindiko">Anāthapiṇḍika</a>'s Park, <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> — this sutta begins:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>II. The Argument</b></p>

					<p class="f4">1.1. To say that The Eye Sense Sphere is the self is absurd because the appearance and end of the eye can be seen. Since the appearance and end of the eye can be seen one would be forced to accept the proposition: "The self appears and ends in myself." This is why the Eye Sense Sphere is not to be understood as the self.<br />
					1.2-6: The same for Ear Sense through Mind Sense<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup>.</span></p>

					<p class="f4">2.1. To say that The Material Shape [visual object] Sense Sphere is the self is absurd because the appearance and end of Material Shape can be seen. Since the appearance and end of material shape can be seen one would be forced to accept the proposition: "The self appears and ends in myself." This is why the Material Shape Sense Sphere is not to be understood as the self.<br />
					2.2-6: The same for Sound Sense Sphere through Mental Object Sense Sphere.</p>

					<p class="f4">3.1. To say that Visual Consciousness is the self is absurd because the appearance and end of Visual Consciousness can be seen. Since the appearance and end of Visual Consciousness can be seen one would be forced to accept the proposition: "The self appears and ends in myself." This is why Visual Consciousness is not to be understood as the self.<br />
					3.2-6: The same for Auditory Consciousness through Mental Consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">4.1. To say that Visual Contact is the self is absurd because the appearance and end of Visual Contact can be seen. Since the appearance and end of Visual Contact can be seen one would be forced to accept the proposition: "The self appears and ends in myself." This is why Visual Contact is not to be understood as the self.<br />
					4.2-6: The same for Auditory Contact through Mental Contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">5.1. To say that Visual Sense Experience is the self is absurd because the appearance and end of Visual Sense Experience can be seen. Since the appearance and end of Visual Sense Experience can be seen one would be forced to accept the proposition: "The self appears and ends in myself." This is why Visual Sense Experience is not to be understood as the self.<br />
					5.2-6: The same for Auditory Sense Experience through Mental Sense Experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">6.1. To say that Visual Hungar/Thirst is the self is absurd because the appearance and end of Visual Hungar/Thirst can be seen. Since the appearance and end of Visual Sense Experience can be seen one would be forced to accept the proposition: "The self appears and ends in myself." This is why Visual Hungar/Thirst is not to be understood as the self.<br />
					6.2-6: The same for Auditory Hungar/Thirst through Mental Hungar/Thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>III. The ways of going which rebound in holding it to be true that there can be that which can be called "My Own"</b></p>

					3.1. One sees it like this: "Visual Consciousness is me, my self, mine."<br />
					3.2-6: The same for Auditory Consciousness through Mental Consciousness.<br />
					4.1. One sees it like this: "Visual Contact is me, my self, mine."<br />
					4.2-6: The same for Auditory Contact through Mental Contact.<br />
					5.1. One sees it like this: "Visual Sense Experience is me, my self, mine."<br />
					5.2-6: The same for Auditory Sense Experience through Mental Sense Experience.<br />
					6.1. One sees it like this: "Visual Hungar/Thirst is me, my self, mine."<br />
					6.2-6: The same for Auditory Hungar/Thirst through Mental Hungar/Thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>IV. The ways of going which rebound in the Ending of holding it to be true that there can be that which can be called "My Own"</b></p>

					<p class="f4">1.1. One sees it like this: "The Eye Sense Sphere is not me, not my self, not mine."<br />
					1.2-6: The same for Ear Sense through Mind Sense.<br />

					4.2-6: The same for Auditory Contact through Mental Contact.<br />
					5.1. One sees it like this: "Visual Sense Experience is not me, not my self, not mine."<br />
					5.2-6: The same for Auditory Sense Experience through Mental Sense Experience.<br />
					6.1. One sees it like this: "Visual Hungar/Thirst is not me, not my self, not mine."<br />
					6.2-6: The same for Auditory Hungar/Thirst through Mental Hungar/Thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>V. The Bias that is possible based on contact</b></p>

					<p class="f4">1. Rebounding off the Eye and Material shape, Visual Consciousness appears; the three joined up is Contact; Rebounding off the contact is Sense Experience which is either Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Not Pleasant but Not Unpleasant. In contact with the Pleasant Sense Experience, delighting in it, welcoming it, becoming attached to it, standing firm thus, there is bias towards lust. In contact with the Unpleasant Sense Experience, grieving, irritated, lamenting, beating the breast, wailing and going mad, there is a bias towards repulsion. In contact with the Not Pleasant but Not Unpleasant Sense Experience, not understanding as it really is the basis for its appearance, not understanding the basis for its termination, or it's sweetness, or it's wretchedness, or it's being left, there is a bias towards blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">2-6: The same for the Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Not Pleasant but Not Unpleasant Sense Experience arising from the contact of the Ear and Sounds, The Nose and Scents, the Tongue and Tastes, the body and touches, and the Mind and Mental Objects.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>VI. Avoiding the Bias</b></p>

					<p class="f4">1. Rebounding off the Eye and Material shape, Visual Consciousness appears; the three joined up is Contact; Rebounding off the contact is Sense Experience which is either Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Not Pleasant but Not Unpleasant. In contact with the Pleasant Sense Experience, not delighting in it, not welcoming it, not becoming attached to it, standing firm thus, there is no bias towards lust. In contact with the Unpleasant Sense Experience, not grieving, not irritated, not lamentaing, not beating the breast, not wailing and going mad, there is no bias towards repulsion. In contact with the Not Pleasant but Not Unpleasant Sense Experience, understanding as it really is the basis for its appearance, understanding the basis for its termination, and it's sweetness, and it's wretchedness, and it's being left, there is no bias towards blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">2-6: The same for the Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Not Pleasant but Not Unpleasant Sense Experience arising from the contact of the Ear and sounds, the Nose and Scents, the Tongue and Tastes, the body and touches, and the Mind and Mental Objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Seeing, the well-taught student of the Aristocrats has had enough of The Eye, has had enough of Material Shape, has had enough of Eye Consciousness, has had enough of Eye Contact, has had enough of Eye Sense Experience, has had enough of Eye hunger/thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has had enough of The Ear and Sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has had enough of The Nose and Scents.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has had enough of The Tongue and Tastes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has had enough of The Body and Touches.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has had enough of The Mind and Mental Objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having had enough he becomes dispassionate; being dispassionate is freedom; in freedom seeing freedom is knowledge of freedom and the knowledge comes: "Left Behind is Rebirth, Lived was the Best of Lives, Done is Duty's Doing, no more hither and yon nor it'n-n-at'n me!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The full unfolding of this sutta is available at:
					<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/mn/mn.148.olds.bd.htm">mn.148.olds</a> ... "unfolding" is the word used for giving the full, unabbreviated version of a sutta, but I think we should use "spinning out" ... this is the web, and here, at least these suttas are being considered "spells" and spells are woven after spinning threads (sutta) and webs are spun out as well as woven. Note the difference between this sort of sutta and the sort called a "wheel" (see: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/03_kv/sn03.34.001-055.olds.bd.htm">SN.III.xiii</a> for an example of this) In an "unfolding" the development is linear. One set of concepts is being fully developed. In a wheel two or more fundamentally different concepts are developed against each other.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2a</a>]</sup> What we have here is the Paticca Samuppada in one of it's lesser-recognized forms. The idea 'rebounding' is usually presented as 'cause' or 'dependance'. Of the two 'dependance' is accurate, cause is not. Consciousness is an independant element and is not caused by eye and visual object coming into contact. Contact is a name for the coming together of eye, visual object, and consciousness. Consciousness appears when there is eye and object and eye-consciousness appears when it 'bounces off' the two. This is someting that must be seen in meditation and is very important for getting the perspective needed to see how nama/rupa and consciousness interact in the formation of the being, and how breaking off the interaction is the key to Nibbāna. If the idea is held in mind that eye and visual object etc. 'cause' consciousness, it will not be possible to see how consciousness can be separate from nama/rupa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>This group and the ones that follow might also be developed going through the complete sequence for the one organ and then repeating the complete sequence for each of the other five.</p>
