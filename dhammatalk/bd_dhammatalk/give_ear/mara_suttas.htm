					<p class="f4">"Know I well that good-for nothing<br />
					penitence at death-defeating aimed<br />
					all-for-naught is made to be<br />
					as oar and rudder on dry land and not the sea</p>

					<p class="f4">Purified the way to purity I've gained<br />
					Get thee gone thy thing of ends<br />
					I've had my fill of making thee amends."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <b>Saŋyutta</b>: pp of saŋyuñjati = (Saŋ + yuñjati: to connect, join with unite)<br />
					<i>yuñjati</i>: Latin: jungo to unite, put together, pp: junctus; Sanskrit: yukta, English: junction, unite; join; Lith: jungin<br />
					To: yuj, yoge, yoga: to yoke<br />
					With "Saŋ" as "Con" we get: Conjoined and we see, back at Saŋyuñjati meaning #2: to couple, to wed someone to. Hitch? Hook?<br />
					I think in today's computer age we must use "Linked"<br />
					So: The Linked Kitbag; The Collection with Cantos; The Spells Linked to Mara, Death, The Evil One (Only a couple of examples are included here; there are quite a few, for the full list see: <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_04_marasamyutta.htm">Index to the Mara Samyutta</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Numbers link to the Pali text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> We are told we are to understand that it was Ānanda who was the repeater-of-record for these suttas; but who was it that told Ānanda? In this case the sutta is not in the form of "Once, Ānanda, I was..." but is in the form of "Once this happened to The Buddha"; and the only other person we know was there was Mara.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Nigrodha,</i> Sanskrit: nyagrodha: the banyan or Indian fig-tree Ficus Indica</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>pathama-abhi-sam-buddho</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Horner and Bhk Bodhi use "enlightenment". The word used is: samajjhagan (&gt; samadhigā; samadhigacchati). Important? I think so. I think the situation before the Buddha was "enlightened" was similar to what we have here today. Those who were working on their minds got high. They do it now, they did it then. The problem was the same then as it is now: drugs are not reliable (in this life) or portable (to other lives), so the intelligent let go of drugs and say 'It has got to be possible to do this (thinking 'and hopefully do it better!') with just the mind.' Afterward, when they do it, they refer to it in the terms from which they emerged: they got high, or they got higher than high. In any case it is important to break away from the sleepy trance of accepted terminology (certainly there is nothing in any of that that is anywhere near the word "enlightenment") as Mara will slip one in there someplace when you are not looking and that will be the one that throws you off track and into another round.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> You know the spot I'm talking about.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					A: <i>No, I'm not sure if I know the spot and I'm not sure what that pic. is.</i><br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					A! You did not spot the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualjagarianuyoga.htm#topajagaranuyoga">spot</a>?<br />
					As for the pic: that's Mara whispering into the ear of Buddha sitting at the root of the Ol'Fig Tree. Back to us.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Nago:</i> NAGA: PED: (Vedic: Naga; ? Anglo Saxon: snaca: snake; snaegl: snail) 1. A serpent or Naga demon, playing a prominent part in Buddhist fairy-tails, gifted with miraculous powers and great strength. They often act as fairies and are classed with other divinities with whom they are sometimes friendly, sometimes at enmity). 2. an elephant, especially a strong, stately animal. 3. The Naga-tree (now called "iron-wood tree," noted for its hard wood and great masses of red flowers</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>bhayam chambhitattam lomahamsam:</i> PED: fear, stupification and horripilation &gt; horrify.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> That's the way it is in the Pali. I prefer to Spell it out, and that is what I will do hereafter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>paccagu</i> (paccca + guu) PED states the word is difficult and gives: "one who goes toward"; Horner has: "pupils"; Bhk. Bodhi has: "become...henchmen"</p>
