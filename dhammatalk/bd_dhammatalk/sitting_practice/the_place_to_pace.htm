					<p class="f4">Hare: tends to good digestion after one has eaten and drunk, munched and crunched.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Caṇkamādhigato samādhi ciraṭṭhitiko:</b> cira: long (of time) [Latin: while  English: wiloon; High Old German:  hveila; Gothic: civis; quiees,] ṭṭhitika: standing thusly, perpetual, lasting long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hare: the concentration won from (the thought of) an alley-walk lasts long.</p>

					<p class="f4">MO: Serenity got pacing is long-lasting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hare footnotes this: At [<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/07_sevens/an07.058.hare.pts.htm">an07.58</a>] the Buddha exhorts <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna</a> to concentrate on his alley-walk to get rid of torpor. <i>Comy.</i> here observes: 'By fixing the attentionon the alley-walk, a concentration of the eight attainments (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/09_nines/an09.033.hare.pts.htm">A. iv, 410,</a> omitting the last<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>) is won.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the passage from <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/07_sevens/an07.058.hare.pts.htm#p8">the Hare translation</a> "If it pass not (the drowsiness), then, with the senses withdrawn, the mind not outward gone, shouldst thou fix thy thought on the alley-walk, conscious of its front and back; and maybe, as thou abidest so, that drowsiness will pass."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is unclear to me as to whether this indicates an instruction as to how to actually use the Alley walk, or to simply put one's mind on it (this is in the context, as noted, of instructing Moggallāna in techniques for remaining wakeful). My inclination is towards the idea that this instruction to Moggallāna is a mental exercise, not a technique for use of the Place to pace.</p>

					<p class="f4">In my experience, while using the place to pace, one does not focus the attention on it; one is aware of it (and it certainly becomes associated with good states in the mind), but one uses pacing back and forth as a platform for developing serenity. The pacing back and forth is sufficiently routine that it allows for clear focus on one's subject of meditation (or the other way around, it requires little attention to keep on pacing...remember the Satipatthana: "<a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#thisisTheWay">This is the way</a> he retains just sufficient conciousness to know: "This is the body".) On the other hand given the same skill at attaining a serene state, it is more difficult to do so pacing back and forth than it is sitting and consequently has the benefits of that which is harder-won. My take.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five, Beggars, are the advantages associated with using the Place to Pace:<br />
					1. One stretches and conditions the limbs<br />
					2. It rouses energy<br />
					3. It is of little harm<br />
					3. One is not afflicted by heartburn and indigestion after eating<br />
					4. The samadhi gained walking the Place to Pace lasts a long time</p>
