					<h1>The Fourty Subjects of Meditation</h1>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>I've read on several occasions about there being "40 objects of meditation" according to the Pali. By any chance would you happen to know what these are or where I could find the list?</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe most who reference to "40 subjects of meditation" are thinking of Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga (The Path of Purity — in my Pali Text Society Edition, pp 129 ff.)</p>

					<p class="f4">These are mentioned in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/01_ones/an01.394-494.olds.bd.htm#p455">The Ones beginning with sutta 455</a>, and, of course, everywhere as this just about covers everything the Buddha taught, and, as I look, I see the one subject not mentioned in Buddhaghosa's list is the "Dhamma Device", or the "Consciousness Device" or using the Dhamma as one's means to concentrate and get high which is, essentially the method being taught here.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Visuddhimagga the list is:</p>

					<p class="f4">[1] Earth, [2] water, [3] fire, [4] wind.<br />
					For these see:<br />

					<p class="f4">[5] Blue-green, [6] yellow, [7] red, [8] white, [9] light, [10] space</p>

					<p class="f4">[11] A swollen corpse, [12] discolored corpse, [13] a festering corpse, [14] a fissured corpse, [15] a mangled corpse, [16] a dismembered corpse, [17] a cut and dismembered corpse, [18] a bloody corpse, [19] a worm-filled corpse, [20] a skeleton.<br />

					<a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#TheCharnelField">The Charnel Field</a> where the corpses described are somewhat different, but the method to be used is the same.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note an odditity about this list: #s 35-38 are not of the nature as to be easily used by beginners. They are already advanced states of samadhi practice and are 'jhanas' in their own right. As devices for samadhi they must be thought of as giving direction to advanced practitioners, possibly from other schools.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Dasa kasiṇāyatanāni</i> Rhys Davids notes the commentary here (and I agree) "Kasina in the sense of entire." I think this is word-play between the title and the subheadings: The 10 Whole-Spheres (ayatana:atmo-sphere) ... the earth-device is whole when perceived as one ...; in other words this is not a description of ten devices, it is a description of when these ten devices are perceived correctly and completely. Sariputta:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"Do you see, friends, that large tree-trunk there?<br />
					"We do, friend."<br />
					If he so wished, friends, a beggar who was a Master of Power, one with mental control, could determine that tree-trunk as earth ... water ... fire ... wind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>PED:</b> Kasiṇa<sup>1</sup>: entire, whole J IV.111, 112.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2"><i>Kasiṇa</i><sup>2</sup> (deriv. uncertain) one of the aids to kammaṭṭhāna the practice by means of which mystic meditation may be attained. They are fully described at A V.46 sq., 60; usually enumerated as ten (that is, earth, water, fire, air; blue, yellow, red, white; space, intellection (or perhaps consciousness) ) - For the last two ākāsa- and viññāṇa-) we find in later sources āloka- and ākāsa-. - Eight = (the above omitting the last two). There are 14 manners of practising the kasiṇas Vism 374. Nine qualities or properties of (paṭhavi-) kasiṇa are enumd at Vism 117. - Each k. is fivefold, according to uddhaṃ, adho, tiriyaṃ, advayaṃ, appamāṇaṃ; M II.15. - kasiṇaṃ oloketi to fix one's gaze on the particular kasiṇa chosen; -ṃ samannāharati to concentrate one's mind on the k..<br />
					<i>-āyatana</i> the base or object of a kasiṇa exercise;<br />
					-<i>kamma</i> the k. practice.<br />
					-jhāna the k. meditation.<br />
					-<i>dosa</i> fault of the k. object Vism 117, 123 (the 4 faults of paṭhavī-kasiṇa being confusion of the 4 colours).<br />
					-<i>parikamma</i> the preliminary, preparatory rites to the exercise of a kasiṇa meditation, such as preparing the frame, repeating the necessary formulas, etc.;<br />
					<i>-ṃ katheti</i> to give instructions in these preparations;<br />
					<i>-ṃ karoti</i> to perform the k-preparations;<br />
					<i>-maṇḍala</i> a board or stone or piece of ground divided by depressions to be used as a mechanical aid to jhāna exercise. In each division of the <i>maṇḍala</i> a sample of a kasiṇa was put. Several of these stone maṇḍalas have been found in the ruins at Anurādhapura.<br />
					<i>-samāpatti</i> attainment in respect of the k. exercise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Walshe notes some confusion concerning the "consciousness" device. This is explained in one sutta that I recollect (cite ?) where he describes this device as the study of the Dhamma. I say that the practice being used here on BuddhaDust is the practice of the Consciousness Device — using Dhamma Vicaya not simply to learn and understand the Dhamma, but as a thing on which to focus the mind so as to bring about results consistent with the Dhamma.</p>
