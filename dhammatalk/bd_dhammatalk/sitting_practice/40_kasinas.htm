					<h1>The Forty Subjects of Meditation</h1>

					<p class="f4">V: <i>I've read on several occasions about there being "40 objects of meditation" according to the <i>Pāḷi.</i> By any chance would you happen to know what these are or where I could find the list?</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe most who reference to "40 subjects of meditation" are thinking of Buddhaghosa's <i>Visuddhimagga</i> (The Path of Purity — in my <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society Edition, pp 129 ff.)</p>

					<p class="f4">These are mentioned in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/01_ones/an01.394-494.olds.bd.htm#p455">The Ones beginning with sutta 455,</a> and, of course, everywhere as this just about covers everything the Buddha taught, and, as I look, I see the one subject not mentioned in Buddhaghosa's list is the "<i>Dhamma</i> Device", or the "Consciousness Device" or using the <i>Dhamma</i> as one's means to concentrate and get high which is, essentially the method being taught here.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the <i>Visuddhimagga</i> the list is:</p>

					<p class="f4">[1] Earth, [2] water, [3] fire, [4] wind.<br />
					For these see:<br />

					<p class="f4">[5] Blue-green, [6] yellow, [7] red, [8] white, [9] light, [10] space.</p>

					<p class="f4">[11] A swollen corpse, [12] discolored corpse, [13] a festering corpse, [14] a fissured corpse, [15] a mangled corpse, [16] a dismembered corpse, [17] a cut and dismembered corpse, [18] a bloody corpse, [19] a worm-filled corpse, [20] a skeleton.<br />

					<p class="f4">[21] Recollecting the Buddha, [22] recollecting the <i>Dhamma,</i> [23] recollecting the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note an oddity about this list: #s 35-38 are not of the nature as to be easily used by beginners. They are already advanced states of <b>samādhi</b> practice and are <i>'jhānas'</i> in their own right. As devices for <i>samādhi</i> they must be thought of as giving direction to advanced practitioners, possibly from other schools.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Dasa kasiṇāyatanāni</i> Rhys Davids notes the commentary here (and I agree) "Kasina in the sense of entire." I think this is word-play between the title and the subheadings: The 10 Whole-Spheres (<i>ayatana:</i> atmo-sphere) ... the earth-device is whole when perceived as one ...; in other words this is not a description of ten devices, it is a description of when these ten devices are perceived correctly and completely. Sariputta:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"Do you see, friends, that large tree-trunk there?<br />
					"We do, friend."<br />
					If he so wished, friends, a beggar who was a Master of Power, one with mental control, could determine that tree-trunk as earth ... water ... fire ... wind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>PED:</b> <i>Kasiṇa:</i><sup>1</sup> entire, whole J IV.111, 112.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2"><i>Kasiṇa</i><sup>2</sup> (deriv. uncertain) one of the aids to <i>kamma-ṭ-ṭhāna</i> the practice by means of which mystic meditation may be attained. They are fully described at A V.46 sq., 60; usually enumerated as ten (that is, earth, water, fire, air; blue, yellow, red, white; space, intellection (or perhaps consciousness) ) - For the last two <i>ākāsa-</i> and <i>viññāṇa-</i>) we find in later sources <i>āloka-</i> and <i>ākāsa-.</i> - Eight = (the above omitting the last two). There are 14 manners of practicing the <i>kasiṇas</i> Vism 374. Nine qualities or properties of <i>(paṭhavi-) kasiṇa</i> are enumd at Vism 117. - Each <i>k.</i> is fivefold, according to <i>uddhaṃ, adho, tiriyaṃ, advayaṃ, appamāṇaṃ;</i> M II.15. - <i>kasiṇaṃ oloketi</i> to fix one's gaze on the particular <i>kasiṇa</i> chosen; <i>-ṃ samannāharati</i> to concentrate one's mind on the <i>k.</i><br />
					<i>-āyatana</i> the base or object of a <i>kasiṇa</i> exercise;<br />
					-<i>kamma</i> the <i>k.</i> practice.<br />
					-<i>jhāna</i> the <i>k.</i> meditation.<br />
					-<i>dosa</i> fault of the <i>k.</i> object Vism 117, 123 (the 4 faults of <i>paṭhavī-kasiṇa</i> being confusion of the 4 colors).<br />
					-<i>parikamma</i> the preliminary, preparatory rites to the exercise of a <i>kasiṇa</i> meditation, such as preparing the frame, repeating the necessary formulas, etc.;<br />
					<i><i>-ṃ katheti</i></i> to give instructions in these preparations;<br />
					<i><b>-ṃ karoti</b></i> to perform the <i>k-</i>preparations;<br />
					<i>-maṇḍala</i> a board or stone or piece of ground divided by depressions to be used as a mechanical aid to <i>jhāna</i> exercise. In each division of the <i>maṇḍala</i> a sample of a <i>kasiṇa</i> was put. Several of these stone <i>maṇḍalas</i> have been found in the ruins at Anurādhapura.<br />
					<i>-samāpatti</i> attainment in respect of the <i>k.</i> exercise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Walshe notes some confusion concerning the "consciousness" device. This is explained in one sutta that I recollect (cite ?) where he describes this device as the study of the <i>Dhamma.</i> I say that the practice being used here on BuddhaDust is the practice of the Consciousness Device — using <i>Dhamma Vicaya</i> not simply to learn and understand the <i>Dhamma,</i> but as a thing on which to focus the mind so as to bring about results consistent with the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>
