					<h1>My Computer</h1>

					<p class="f4">This is a <i>vipassana</i> exercise.</p>

					<p class="f4">I think it is a fair inference that the majority of those who are reading this are using computers. The computer has a great many similarities to the mind. It has hardware "The Being Human", an operating system (strings (suttas) of instructions about what to do with information it receives, <i>i.e.,</i> identify it, classify it, multiply it, divide it, turn it into a colored pixel, stream of pixels, or a sound, check its spelling, and so forth based on a number of choices that were programmed into it and using a series of databases that are also stored on board), and sensors capable of receiving data: the keyboard, a microphone, a video camera, a telephone line. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Almost from the outset this computer interface with the world that we use begins to reflect the state of our mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mine gets scanned every evening and defragmented.<br />
					I run without a Crash Guard because I have found that it doesn't guard against the kind of crashes that I experience most frequently, that it doesn't save me any grief when it does crash in a way that it can recognize, and it uses up system resources, both at start-up and while running. </p>

					<p class="f4">I empty the trash, purge the Internet Cache, clean out the Temp files, Empty the Recent Folder (on the track of tracklessness) and the log of the personal firewall, and I have disabled those parts of all the other programs that retain a history of my activities that goes back further than one day (and I do not fool myself into thinking that there are not those who are able to find this information even after a vigorous effort to erase it from my memory).</p>

					<p class="f4">My computer is fast (but within the short year or so of its existence the speed of fast PCs have doubled and even tripled), it has a very large memory (both short term and long term) (but here, again, there are computers that have evolved to such a degree as to dwarf this one by comparison), and is partitioned by major function groups: Operating System, Swap File and Personal Files, Business Programs, Arty Programs, and <i>a hidden disk</i> that nobody can find that is totally encrypted ... in it I keep my "Recapitulation", my personal memories and thoughts of everyone I have ever known.</p>

					<p class="f4">Icons and the Desktop have begun to develop individualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">My Spelling Dictionary begins to include more and more <i>Pāḷi</i> words.</p>

					<p class="f4">How much of a percentage of my computer reflects my Buddhist pre-occupation?</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to die today, and someone were to come along and look at my computer and ask himself: "What sort of being owned this computer?" What would they think?</p>

					<p class="f4">What would they think of your computer?</p>
