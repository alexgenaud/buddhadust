					<h4>Sabbakāya</h4>

					<p class="f4"><b>What does that mean? Sabbakaya ... All-Body?</b></p>

					<p class="f4">All body is that which relates directly to the body: the eye, the seen visible object, the sensation, and the consciousness of vision, but not beyond, for example to any inference that might be drawn from such seeing. This can include whole worlds as long as they are directly influencing the body. So-and-so making loud noises next door causing anoiance to the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">All body is contrasted with 'Own body'. Own body is that which is held by the individual to belong to himself. The eye, the sensation, the consciousness, but not the visible object.</p>
