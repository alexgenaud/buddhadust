					<h1>High Lifestyle</h1>

					<p class="f4">High Lifestyle is the style or process of living in accordance with this system:<br />
					Identifying an element of one's lifestyle<br />
					that is clearly seen by one's self as low,<br />
					harmful,<br />
					detrimental to one's self or others<br />
					one abandons it, lets it go, drops it, renounces it, restrains it, eradicates it.</p>

					<h4 class="c"><b><a id="HOW_TO_JUDGE">HOW TO JUDGE</a><br />
					FROM<br />
					PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</b></h4>

					<p class="f4">How to know your friends<br />
					How to know if you are doing the right thing<br />
					Using the right bowl, robes, food, shelter<br />
					Following the right teacher<br />
					Begging from the right town:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not do or not do a deed<br />
					Because it is the law of the land<br />
					The word of the Elders<br />
					The pronouncement of some authority<br />
					Because hear-say say so<br />
					Because it is traditional<br />
					"The custom of my people."<br />
					Because it is the conclusion reached after thinking over reasons,</p>

					<p class="f4">But do or do not do a deed<br />
					Only after careful consideration<br />
					Of your own personal experience<br />
					<span class="c">Before</span><br />
					<span class="c">During</span><br />
					And<br />
					<span class="c">After</span></p>

					<p class="f4">If Beforehand you think:<br />
					"Bad conditions will increase</p>

					<p class="f4">and</p>

					<p class="f4">Good conditions will decrease<br />
					Going that way"<br />
					Then<br />
					Do not go further on that way</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you think:<br />
					"Good conditions will increase<br />
					and<br />
					Bad conditions will decrease<br />
					Going <span class="c">This Way"</span><br />
					Then<br />
					Go <span class="c">This Way</span><br />
					A little Further</p>

					<p class="f4">If During you think:<br />
					"Bad conditions are increasing<br />
					and<br />
					Good conditions are decreasing<br />
					As I go that way"<br />
					Then do not go further on that way<br />
					Even if it means you must get up and go<br />
					Without saying "goodbye"</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you think:<br />
					"Good conditions are increasing<br />
					and<br />
					Bad conditions are decreasing<br />
					As I go along <span class="c">This Way</span>"<br />
					Then<br />
					Go <span class="c">This Way</span><br />
					A little Further<br />
					Even if it means maybe having to work a little,<br />
					Experience a little discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">If afterward you think:<br />
					"Bad conditions increased<br />
					and<br />
					Good conditions decreased<br />
					Going that way"<br />
					Then<br />
					Do not go that way again</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you think:<br />
					"Good conditions increased<br />
					and<br />
					Bad conditions decreased<br />
					As I went along <span class="c">This Way</span>"<br />
					Then<br />
					Keep Going<br />
					Along <span class="c">This Way</span><br />
					A little Further</p>

							 <div class="inback">
							 <p>The importance of this little ditty cannot be overemphasized. For Good and Bad Conditions, look to conditions within yourself, in the others and in conditions in the surrounding situation. For Bad Conditions, look for conditions that increase Wanting, Anger, and Blindness; for Good Conditions look for conditions that are without Wanting, Anger, and Blindness.</p>
