					<h1>High Memory aka: The Mind</h1>

					<p class="f4">High Memory describes the ideal state of the Memory of one who has set up memory [<i>sati paṭṭhāna</i>] in four areas:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr"><img src="../../resources/images/sign_1.5.gif" width="19" height="36" alt="sign #1" /></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">One with memory so set up<br />
					revisits the body watching over the body,<br />
					energetic, alert, satisfied,<br />
					with the awareness that 'This is body'<br />
					set up to just such a degree as will sustain recollectedness,<br />
					Such a one sees how body is a thing<br />
					that comes to be and comes to an end<br />
					with such penetrating knowledge<br />
					that he releases his angry downbound worldly ambition and disappointments, and,<br />
					rising above it all,<br />
					watchful and diligent,<br />
					appamada,<br />
					satisfied,<br />
					Reviewing and calming down,<br />
					Overcoming any <a href="hunger_thirst.htm">hunger/thirst</a> that may appear,<br />
					he is bound up bound up in nothing at all in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When such a one goes to <a href="../the_pali_line/bag/high_getting_high/the_seat/seat.htm">sit</a>, he looks for a place of solitude, sits down sitting up straight with his legs bent across his lap, recollectedness at the area of the face, in this way he remembers his in and out breaths.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he breathes in, he is aware that he is doing so.<br />
					When he breaths out, he is aware that he is doing so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is aware when his in-breath is deep, and<br />
					He is aware when his out-breath is deep, and<br />
					He is aware when his in-breath is shallow, and<br />
					He is aware when his out-breath is shallow.</p>

					<p class="f4">He stills, calms, and tranquillizes the body when he breathes in and<br />
					he releases his attachments to the body when he breaths out.</p>

					<p class="f4">He reflects on the experience of <a href="all_body.htm">all that is related to body</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is aware of the positioning of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows whether he is coming or going,<br />
					if he is facing or facing the other way.<br />
					If he is bending a limb,<br />
					or outstretching a bent limb,<br />
					whether he is waking up,<br />
					rising up,<br />
					attending to bowl and robes,<br />
					leaving his hut,<br />
					going to town,<br />
					going on his Beggars rounds,<br />
					eating,<br />
					chewing,<br />
					tasting,<br />
					or swallowing,<br />
					getting out of town,<br />
					urinating or defecating,<br />
					entering his hut,<br />
					sitting down,<br />
					or <a href="four_postures.htm">lying down</a>,<br />
					<a href="high_talk.htm">talking</a> or keeping silent,<br />
					awake or <a href="self-defense.htm#sleep_little">asleep</a><br />
					he does whatsoever he does,<br />
					in a Satisfactory Fashion.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Same Way as The Cattle Butcher,<br />
					or The Butcher's Skillful Apprentice,<br />
					having slain some cow,<br />
					and wishing to display his meat<br />
					by the crossroads as he sits,<br />
					arranges the various portions<br />
					in a satisfying way,<br />
					one with memory established<br />
					knows whether he is coming or going,<br />
					if he is facing or facing the other way.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is aware of the basic elements found in the body:<br />
					Earth,<br />
					Water,<br />
					Fire,<br />
					Wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Same Way as The Cattle Butcher, or The Butcher's Skillful Apprentice,<br />
					wishing to butcher some cow, knows:<br />
					"In this cow there are<br />
					Solid things,<br />
					Wet things,<br />
					Warm things, and<br />
					Things that are still moving."</p>

					<p class="f4">He is aware of the disgusting nature of the body,<br />
					considering it like a double-ended skin bag<br />
					filled with various sorts of filth, so:<br />
					there is in this body:<br />
					Hair of the head, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, meat, sinews, bones, marrow, esophagus, lungs, heart, pancreas, stomach, liver, kidneys, large intestine, small intestines, spleen, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, tears, fat, spit, snot, urine, feces and your brain.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as the Bean Peddler, or The Bean Peddler's Skillful Apprentice,<br />
					whenever he wishes to dump out his goods,<br />
					opens the lower end of his double-ended sample bag and<br />
					Dumps out his beans,<br />
					so that any man with eyes in his head that can see could see:<br />
					"There is rice, there are black beans, there are kidney beans, there are peas, there are string beans, there are sesame seeds, there is wild rice, there are oats, and there is corn, husked and ready for boiling.</p>

					</div>

					<p class="f4">He is aware that the fate of the body is the charnal ground,<br />
					and reflects on his own body, thinking:<br />
					"This body too, is just like such a corpse tossed away,<br />
					is confounded just like that,<br />
					has not risen above just such an end as that.</p>

					that comes to be and comes to an end<br />
					with such penetrating knowledge<br />
					that he releases his angry downbound worldly ambitions and disappointments, and,<br />
					rising above it all,<br />
					watchful and diligent,<br />
					appamada,<br />
					satisfied,<br />
					reviewing and calming down,<br />
					Overcoming any <a href="hunger_thirst.htm">hunger/thirst</a> that may appear,<br />
					he is bound up bound up in nothing at all in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here he is aware, when a sensation that is<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					or neither unpleasant nor pleasant<br />
					occurs as a consequence of <a href="contact.htm">contact</a> of<br />
					eye, visible object and consciousness<br />
					ear, auditory object and consciousness<br />
					nose, scent and consciousness<br />
					tongue, taste and consciousness<br />
					body, touch and consciousness, or<br />
					mind [mano], mental object and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows when such a sensation has to do with worldly things and when such a sensation has to do with letting go</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands that the same sensation can be seen in different ways according as it has to do with worldly things or letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, he knows a heart by reading his own heart, and, with penetrating knowledge,</p>
