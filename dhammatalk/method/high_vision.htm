					<h4 class="in1 c">Downbound Confounded Rebounding Conjuration</h4>
					<p class="f4 in1">Downbound because "down" it is what is tying one down, "up" it is headed downward.<br />
					Confounded because it is the co-founding by that which is identified as the self and "the world" of a personal world  —  made through identification with intentional acts of body, speech or mind where the intention is to produce experience in the self and which result in sensations identified as belonging to the self.<br />
					Rebounding because it doubles back on the track of the force which creates it<br />
					Conjuration meaning the same thing as Confounding (joining together to bring into existence) but is here a word for the act where the former was a word for the fact.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">See, do not "understand in theory" or "think through", but actually "envision"   —  "see in the mind" how:</p>

						<p class="f4 in2"><b>Downbound blindness rebounds bound up in confounding</b><br />
						That is: Blindness to these Four Aristocrats of Truths  —  this Aristocratic Multi-Dimensional High Way  —  Or, in other words, blindness to the fact that Whatsoever has Come to Be is a Thing Destined to Come to an End  —  results in creation of existence in a personal world.</p>
