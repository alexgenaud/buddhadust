					<h1>Giving</h1>

					<p class="f4">Giving is the first step for the absolute beginner in the Buddha's <a href="naya_the_method.htm">Method</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Method is based on what we might call a "Law of Physics" called <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This view of <i>kamma.</i> holds that<br />
					<b><i>the reaction — return — rebound<br />
					consequent upon an action<br />
					depends on the power of the actor,<br />
					the power of the deed, and<br />
					the power of the recipient of the deed.</i></b>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of the deed<br />
					is proportional to its ability to assist the recipient<br />
					along the path toward detachment.<br />
					Therefore deeds of mind are the most powerful,<br />
					deeds of word and body are less powerful.</p>

					<p class="f4">A passing thought is not a deed of mind.<br />
					For a deed of mind to take place<br />
					there must be intent attached.<br />
					[<i>i.e.,</i> "O,O,O, If only so and so were such and such". Wish. Will.]</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of the actor and that of the recipient is proportional to the clarity of their minds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clarity of mind is proportional to the detachment of the individual.<br />
					[The attached mind is necessarily biased and therefore unclear and of divided power.]</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c in2"><i><b>"The wishes of the virtuous, beggars,<br />
					come to fruition<br />
					because of their clarity."</b></i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">This view holds that<br />
					<b><i>there is no doing of a deed without experiencing the consequences thereof,</i></b><br />
					but that the consequences are subjectively experienced<br />
					in accordance with the intent of the deed<br />
					(to create pleasure, pain or to end <i>kamma</i>)<br />
					and the mental state of the individual<br />
					at the time of the experience of a deed's consequences.</p>

					<p class="f4">This allows for the subjective escape from <i>kamma</i><br />
					by the alteration of one's intentions and behavior<br />
					as well as by elimination of one's attachment<br />
					to the things of this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, beggars, of a rich man who steals a poor farmer's pig,<br />
					and take the case of the poor farmer who steals a rich merchant's pig.<br />
					What is the case here?<br />
					When the poor farmer steals the rich merchant's pig and is caught,<br />
					he is beaten to within an inch of his life and is made to pay for the pig as well.<br />
					When the rich man steals the poor farmer's pig and is caught,<br />
					the poor farmer begs the rich man to pay him back and maybe he is compensated and maybe he is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, take the case, beggars, of a small cup of water into which is placed a large spoonful of salt,<br />
					and take the case of a large barrel of fresh rain water into which is place a large spoonful of salt.<br />
					What is the case here?<br />
					When the large spoonful of salt is placed into the small cup of water,<br />
					it renders the water undrinkable,<br />
					but when the large spoonful of salt is placed into the large barrel of fresh rain water<br />
					it is hardly noticed if at all.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Unless it leads to giving up,<br />
					giving necessarily involves activity which precludes it from being a complete path to detachment.<br />
					The primary purpose of giving <i><b>in this method, then,</b></i><br />
					is the creation of good <i>kamma</i><br />
					<i><b>for the purposes of attaining calm.</b></i>.</p>

					<p class="ctr f4">The primary purpose of the method<br />
					is not the creation of good <i>kamma</i> or calm,<br />
					but the escape from <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Having the idea that one has some good <i>kamma</i> out there<br />
					instills confidence,<br />
					confidence instills calm,<br />
					calm instills detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">You go up ahead a bit<br />
					and there are some potentially very scary things<br />
					you are going to have to deal with.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having a bankroll of good <i>kamma</i><br />
					is very handy for such times.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">— <b>Fear and trembling are a  hindrance in this method.</b></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In terms of <i>kamma,</i> there is no act of giving which is insignificant.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, beggars, if one were to scrape the dishes into the sewers with the idea of feeding the small creatures that are living there, that would not be without fruit." </p>
