					<h1>The Four Paths to Power</h1>

					<h4 class="ctr">Iddhipāda</h4>

					<p class="f4">The thinking out and development, accumulated practice, attainment and mastery of great heights in the four paths to power such as to be able to use them as a means of advancement and a basis for liberation.</p>

					<h1>The Four Paths to Power</h1>

					<p class="f4"><b>Persistent effort at making one's own a HighGetting focused on realizing one's intent;</b></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Persistent effort at making one's own a HighGetting focused on generating energy;</b></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Persistent effort at making one's own a HighGetting focused developing strength of will;</b></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Persistent effort at making one's own a HighGetting focused on developing rememberance.</b></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>And this is thrown in for a fifth: Making Effort.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">A more literal translation:</p>

					<p class="f4">Four are the power-paths which developed, made a big thing of, conduce to leading to beyond the not beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar develops the power-path<br />

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.</p>
					<p class="f4">What, then, is the way, what path is to be tracked  for the development of the power-paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a beggar develops the power-path<br />

					<h4 class="c">Other Feats of Magic Power</h4>

					<p class="f3"><b>An Act of Truth</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This is an act performed in order to obtain some usually desperately needed wish. It is the statement of a wish asking that it be granted if a statement that is made about one's self is true and that one be punished if it is false. Very much like 'swaring' to the truth in asking for mercy.</p>

					<p class="f2 in2">Examples: — <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.489.rous.pts.htm">Jat 489</a><br />
					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/04_fours/an04.055.olds.bd.htm">AN 4.55:</a> Matched Lives</p>

					<p class="f3"><b>This is Vessavaṇa's Sanspareil Mango Tree!</b></p>

					<p class="f4">First make a great mango tree grow before the palace door. Then throw up a ball of string and make it catch on a branch of the tree. Then climb up the string into the Mango Sanspareil. Then the slaves of Vessavaṇa's as is their usual practice, will chop you up limb-meal and throw down the bits. Then your compatriots should join the pieces together and pour water on them. Then don upper and under garments of flowers and rise up and do a dance.</p>

					<p class="f4">If that does not please the audience, built a fire and enter it with your troupe and when the fire has burn out and the audience has sprinkled it with water, rise up and dance in upper and under garments of flowers.</p>

					<p class="f2 in2">— <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.489.rous.pts.htm">Jat 489</a></p>

					<p class="f3"><b>The Half-body Dance</b></p>

					<p class="f4">One hand, one foot, one eye, one tooth, go a-dancing, throbbing, flickering to and fro, all the rest remains stone still.</p>

					<p class="f2 in2">— <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.489.rous.pts.htm">Jat 489</a><br />
					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.5/jat.5.519.fran.pts.htm">Jat 519:</a> Where the Act of Truth is used as an oath to demonstrate that one has told the truth by the mechanism: 'If I have spoken the truth, let such and such thing happen.'</p>

					<p class="f3"><b>The Arrow-defence</b></p>

					<p class="f4">This one as described in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.5/jat.5.522.fran.pts.htm">Jat 522</a>. Four archers of surpassing skill stand at each of four corners with 30,000 arrows apiece. That would take up an area of approximately 41 square feet so presumably these archers also have helpers bringing the arrows closer as they are used up, but maybe not. These four men shoot arrows at will at the one performing the Arrow-defense who is standing in the middle of the square. This man intercepts without being injured each arrow and places it down neatly arrow point outward, feathers, inward in a circle around himself building up an enclosure effectively encased in iron (the tips of the arrows. Lest someone think he can toss a torch into the enclosure and take care of the rascal, he flies up and presents himself to the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">The next trick is: ...<b>The Pierced Circle</b> the four men stationed at the four corners that failed to wound him are posted at the four corners, he will wound them with a single arrow. If the archers do not dare to stand there fix four plantains at the four corners, and fastening a scarlet thread on the feathered part of the arrow, shot it, aiming at one of the plantains. The arrow strikes it and then the second, the third and the fourth, one after another, and then strikes the first, which it had already pierced, and returnes to the archer's hand; while the plantains stand encircled with the thread.<br />
					A few other archery feats are given by name but with no description, but these can with some imagination be worked out:
					the arrow-stick,<br />
					the arrow-rope,<br />
					the arrow-plait,<br />
					the arrow-terrace,<br />
					arrow-pavilion,<br />
					arrow-wall,<br />
					arrow-stairs,<br />
					arrow-tank,<br />
					making the arrow-lotus to blossom<br />
					causing it to rain a shower of arrows.</p>
