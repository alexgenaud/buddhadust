					<h1>High Talk</h1>

					<p class="f4">No intentional untrue, cruel, harsh, slanderous or useless talk.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Letting go of lies and deception,<br />
					live abstaining from intentional untruth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be a straight-talker,<br />
					one whose word can be counted on,<br />
					one whose word can be trusted,<br />
					dependable,<br />
					no deceiver of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of malicious speech,<br />
					do not repeat in one place what is heard in another place<br />
					to the disadvantage of anyone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Make peace between those with differences<br />
					and encourage the peace of those who are friends.<br />
					Rejoicing in peace,<br />
					loving peace,<br />
					delighting in peace,<br />
					be one whose words speak up for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go harsh language,<br />
					abstain from from abusive speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak words that are blameless,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					penetrating to and vibrating in the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					words that charm and enchant the people.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of idle talk,<br />
					know the right time to speak,<br />
					say only what is true and to the point,<br />
					speak about the Dhamma and Discipline,<br />
					words to be treasured,<br />
					well-reasoned,<br />
					well-defined,<br />
					connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstain from such idle talk as talk of<br />
					kings and ministers of state,<br />
					robbers and thieves,<br />
					the horrors of war and battle;<br />
					talk of food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands and perfumes;<br />
					talk of cities, towns, villages,<br />
					relationships, men and women,<br />
					heroes and villains;<br />
					gossip at the corner,<br />
					over the back fence,<br />
					or at the well<br />
					talk of those alive or of those who are departed;<br />
					talk comparing differences between this and that;<br />
					speculative talk about creation,<br />
					existence or non-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstain from argument and contention, using such phrases as:<br />
					'You clearly don't understand this doctrine and discipline, whereas I do.'<br />
					'How could someone suchas you understand this doctrine and discipline?'<br />
					'What you are saying is wrong. What I am saying is right.'<br />
					'What I am saying is consistent, what you are saying is not.'<br />
					'You have said last what should have been said first and first what should have been said last!'<br />
					'What you have argued for so long has been refuted!'<br />
					'Your challenge has been met and you have been defeated!'<br />
					'How will you get out of this one? Answer me that one, you!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstain from trickery and deceit, such as outright deception, patter, hinting, signifying, belittling, and cajoling in the quest for adding gain to gain.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, that talk which is lofty,<br />
					a help to opening up the mind<br />
					and which conduces to complete turning away from,<br />
					to detachment,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					calm,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					self awakening<br />
					and Nibbāna,<br />
					that is to say talk about wanting little,<br />
					talk about contentment,<br />
					talk about impassivity,<br />
					talk about living in solitude,<br />
					talk about putting forth energy,<br />
					talk about ethical conduct,<br />
					talk about getting high,<br />
					talk about wisdom,<br />
					talk about freedom,<br />
					talk about the knowledge and vision of freedom —<br />
					then one may think::<br />
					'I will talk talk like this.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Fit to Speak With</b></p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three topics of discourse</p>

					<p class="f4">Talk of the Past, saying: "This is the way it was in the Past."<br />
					Talk of the Future, saying: "This is the way it will be in the Future."<br />
					Talk of the Present, saying: "This is how it is now."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be determined of a person by his speech<br />
					whether he is fit to be spoken to or<br />
					not fit to be spoken to.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on being asked a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not give a categorical reply<br />
					to a question requiring it —<br />
					for example, by not giving an exactly factual answer to a question,<br />
					or not answering with "Yes" or "No"</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not give a discriminating reply<br />
					to a question requiring it —<br />
					if he does not give answers such as<br />
					"If such and such is the case,<br />
					then such and such is the answer,<br />
					but if such and such is the case,<br />
					then the answer is such and such."</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not reply by a counter-question<br />
					to a question requiring it —<br />
					such as when the answer to the counter question<br />
					answers the original question.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not waive a question<br />
					which should be waived —<br />
					such as when a question is off the subject,<br />
					irrelevant, argumentative.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Beggars, a Beggar is not fit to be spoken to.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he does, he is.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on being asked a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not abide by conclusions,<br />
					whether right or wrong —<br />
					such as, for example, when, in developing an argument,<br />
					a clearly erroneous conclusion is intentionally reached<br />
					in order to demonstrate the falsity of the argument,<br />
					that conclusion must be accepted.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not abide by an assumption —<br />
					abiding by the basic assumptions made at the outset,<br />
					or during a debate.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not abide by recognized arguments —<br />
					up is up, down is down, red is red, good is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person does not abide by usual procedure —<br />
					logic and reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that person is not fit to be spoken to.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he does, he is.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">If a person, on being asked a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">Evades the question by another question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turns the discussion off the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">Displays vexation, malice and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that person is not fit to be spoken to.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he does not, he is.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">If a person, on being asked a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">Loads with abuse and beats down the questioner,<br />
					laughs him to scorn and catches him up when he falters,</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that person is not fit to be spoken to.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he does not, he is.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is possible to determine of a person,<br />
					by his speach,<br />
					whether he is assured or unassured.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who does not listen is unassured.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who listens is assured.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is assured, fully understands one thing,<br />
					comprehends one thing,<br />
					abandons one thing,<br />
					realizes one thing</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands <a href="pain.htm">Pain</a>,<br />
					he comprehends <a href="high_working_hypothesis.htm#origin">pain's co-arising</a>,<br />
					he abandons <a href="high_working_hypothesis.htm#ending">thirst</a>,<br />
					he realizes <a href="naya_the_method.htm">the Way</a> that leads to it's ending.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="in2"><a id="Lying">Lying</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Lying, Friends,<br />
					If made an habitual practice<br />
					Brings one to Hell<br />
					Of trifling consequence<br />
					Is the fact that it leads to Madness<br />
					In the Here and Now.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man might steal to feed his family or from his own hunger,<br />
					and a man might [not 'is allowed'] kill in an uncharacteristic fit of rage or from self defense,<br />
					but from the liar any form of behavior can be expected.</p>

					<p class="f4">The liar, having no grounding in any idea of what is the truth,<br />
					has no basis for moral compunction in any other area<br />
					and is capable of any kind of act for unpredictable reasons.<br />
					As such the lie,<br />
					laying the groundwork for all kinds of bad deeds,<br />
					is held in most cases to be of more powerful bad kamma<br />
					than is killing or theft.</p>
