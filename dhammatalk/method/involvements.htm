					<h1>The Involvements</h1>

					<h4 class="ctr">Nivarana</h4>

					<p class="f4 in1">Wanting<br />
					Deviant Ways [anger, hate]<br />
					Lazy Ways and Inertia<br />
					Fear and Trembling<br />
					Doubt</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is Wanting present in the here and now,<br />
					practice mentally tracing things back to the repulsive features of the thing causing the wanting.</p>

					<p class="f4">In broad, general terms, the repulsive feature of a thing is it's changeable nature, its being a vehicle for Pain, and the fact that there is nothing in it that is of the nature of Self or that belongs to the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is no Wanting present in the here and now,<br />
					make yourself conscious of the fact and be happy without becoming prideful.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there are deviant ways present in the here and now,<br />
					practice freeing the heart by friendly vibrations.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there are no deviant ways present in the here and now,<br />
					make yourself conscious of the fact and be happy without becoming prideful.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is lazy-ways-and-inertia present in the here and now,<br />
					practice making effort, putting forth energy, striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is no laziness-and-inertia present in the here and now,<br />
					make yourself conscious of the fact and be happy without becoming prideful.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is fear-and-trembling present in the here and now,<br />
					practice stilling, calming, tranquilizing the body and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is no fear-and-trembling present in the here and now,<br />
					make yourself conscious of the fact and be happy without becoming prideful.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is doubt present in the here and now,<br />
					practice investigating things<br />
					from the point of view of what you consider good and bad,<br />
					blamelessness and blameworthiness,<br />
					low and high, dark and light.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is no doubt present in the here and now,<br />
					make yourself conscious of the fact and be happy without becoming prideful.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, as a man, after taking out a loan and setting up a business, and after a time that business becomes successful and he should pay off that loan and have a little left over with which to support a wife, he would feel relief because of this, he would be happy because of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, as a man might have fallen sick from some disease, be in pain, in critical condition, unable to eat and without strength in his body, but after a time he were to recover, be free of pain, out of danger from that disease, able to eat, and feeling the strength return to his body, he would feel relief because of this, he would be happy because of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, as a man who had been thrown in prison might be freed from bondage, safe and secure, with no loss of property, he would feel relief because of this, he would be happy because of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, as a man who had been a slave, not his own man, subject to another, not free to go where he wanted and who, after a time was emancipated, made his own man, not subject to another, free to go where he wanted, he would feel relief because of this, he would be happy because of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, as a wealthy merchant traveling on the highway through the wilderness filled with robbers, murderers, and kidnappers, and, after a time he were to emerge from that wilderness safe and sound, with no loss of property, he would feel relief because of this, he would be happy because of this.</p>
