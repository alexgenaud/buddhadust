					<h1>The Four Manners of God</h1>

					<p class="f4">Living in a manner that pervades<br />
					all manner of Friendly Vibrations<br />
					throughout every direction<br />
					to every manner of being<br />
					and wishing for them too<br />
					the experience of Friendly Vibrations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living in a manner that pervades<br />
					all manner of Sympathetic Vibrations<br />
					throughout every direction<br />
					to every manner of being<br />
					and wishing for them too<br />
					the experience of Sympathetic Vibrations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living in a manner that pervades<br />
					all manner of Empathetic Vibrations<br />
					throughout every direction<br />
					to every manner of being<br />
					and wishing for them too<br />
					the experience of Empathetic Vibrations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living in a manner that reflects<br />
					utter Objective Detachment<br />
					from absolutely everything<br />
					throughout every direction<br />
					including every manner of being<br />
					but wishing for them too<br />
					the experience of Utter Objective Detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Master thus addressed the Brotherhood: "Brethren, charity practiced with all devotion of thought, meditated upon, increased, made a vehicle of progress, made your one object, practiced, well begun, may be expected to produce Eleven Blessings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are these eleven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy he sleeps and happy he awakes;<br />
					he sees no bad dreams;<br />
					men love him;<br />
					spirits guard him;<br />
					fire, poison, and sword come not near him;<br />
					quickly he becomes absorbed in mind;<br />
					his look grows calm;<br />
					he dies undismayed;<br />
					without need of further wisdom he goes to Brahma's heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Charity, Brethren, practiced with renunciation of one's wishes" — and so forth — "may be expected to produce these eleven blessings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Praising the charity which holds these eleven blessings, Brethren,<br />
					a Brother ought to show kindness to all creatures,<br />
					whether expressly commanded or not,<br />
					he should be a friend to the friendly,<br />
					aye a friend to the unfriendly,<br />
					and a friend to the indifferent:<br />
					thus to all without distinction,<br />
					whether expressly bidden or not,<br />
					he should show charity:<br />
					he should show sympathy with joy and sorrow and practice equanimity;<br />
					he should do his work by means of the four excellences.</p>

					<p class="f4">By so doing he will go to Brahma's heaven even without path or fruit.</p>
