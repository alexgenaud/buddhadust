Seeing the arising of individualized consciousness and sense experience; seeing the ending of individualized consciousness and sense experience; understanding that this seeing and all those mental states that came before are confounded, made up of parts, subject to breaking a-part, ending, resolve (and do not just resolve, but actually do it) to let go of confounding mental states and by that attain the uttermost objective detachment possible, and at that point, seeing that this is being free,</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">In freedom recognize freedom, and</p>
