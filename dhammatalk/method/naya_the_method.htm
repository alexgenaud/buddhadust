						"up" it is headed downward.<br />
						Confounded because it is the co-founding by that which is identified as the self and "the world" of a personal world — made through identification with intentional acts of body, speech or mind where the intention is to produce experience in the self and which result in sensations identified as belonging to the self. Otherwise called here "own-making".<br />
						Rebounding because it doubles back on the track of the force which creates it.<br />
						Conjuration meaning the same thing as confounding (joining together to bring into existence) but is here a word for the act where the former was a word for the fact.</p>
