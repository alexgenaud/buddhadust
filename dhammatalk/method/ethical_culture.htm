					And<br />
					Doing<br />
					What Ought not to be Done</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">"As ye sow, so shall ye reap."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In this <a href="naya_the_method.htm">method</a>, because it is based on a perceived 'law of nature' called <i>'kamma',</i> which speaks about acts as carrying consequences primarily of importance to the one doing the deed, ethical culture is dictated by self-interest, not some authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">While good deeds produce <i>kamma</i> the consequences of which are experienced as <a href="sensation.htm">pleasant sensations,</a> in this system, ethical behavior produces <i>kamma</i> the consequences of which are experienced as <a href="sensation.htm">neither pleasant nor unpleasant sensations</a> and which are intended to bring <i>kamma</i> to an end for the individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here ethical culture is always the abstention from an act that would produce bad <i>kamma,</i> as such the implied intention is toward the Ending of <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here there is no bad <i>kamma</i> from deeds of omission, no matter how compelling, or no matter how much the culture of the times might dictate the opposite.</p>

					<p class="f4">If 'doing deeds' were required, the goal of ending <i>kamma</i> could not be attained.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Acts are produced by an individual through three modes:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Imagining,</b> or mental wishing or willing or intending.<br />
					<b>Word Thought and Speech</b> (first you mutter to yourself, and then, we shudder to think of it, you speak)<br />
					<b>Bodily Acts</b> (unbend bent arm, bend unbent arm)</p>

					<p class="f4">The Intent behind the act determines the <a href="sensation.htm">Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant</a> outcome in terms of subjective experience.<br />
					One intends to produce pleasant sensations, or unpleasant sensations, or to end <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The first steps in <a href="naya_the_method.htm#p8dway">The Aristocratic Multi-dimensional High Way</a> after <a href="high_working_hypothesis.htm">High View</a> are discussions of Ethical Culture, and in some ways the entire <a href="naya_the_method.htm">system</a> can be seen as a system of higher ethical culture.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Buddhist Order, there are more than 200 rules of conduct ... However, one time a Beggar came to the Buddha and said that he was unable to remember so many rules and consequently feared falling off the <a href="naya_the_method.htm">path.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha asked him if he thought he could remember three rules.</p>

					<p class="f4">He said he could.</p>

					<p class="f4">So for the purposes of introducing ethical culture, while not discouraging the newcomer with excessive rules, here are the three rules:</p>

					<p class="f4 c">1. Train yourself to abstain from intentional harm to living creatures<br />
					2. Train yourself to abstain from intentionally saying that which is not true<br />
					3. Train yourself to abstain from intentionally taking things that have not been given to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In your imaginings, word thought and speech, and bodily acts.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4><a id="Occupations">Occupations</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">A Lay Follower should avoid these five Occupations:</p>

					<p class="f4">What Five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dealing in weapons,<br />
					selling human beings,<br />
					raising livestock for slaughter or any other occupation that requires slaughter of animals,<br />
					selling alcohol,<br />
					and selling poisons.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4>Paths Leading Upward</h4>

					<p class="f4">There are these three paths<br />
					leading upward<br />
					following which one<br />
					goes upward starting from the first step:<br />
					1. for the liar, there is speaking truth,<br />
					2. for the bloody handed, there is harmlessness,<br />
					3. for the thief, there is not stealing.</p>

					<h4>Ethical Culture in detail as lived By Gotama, The Awake</h4>

					<p class="f2">From: <b><i>Dīgha Nikāya</i></b> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Sutta 1,</a> <i>Brahmajala Sutta:</i> The BrahmaNet Spell as translated from the <i>Pāḷi</i> by Olds.</p>
