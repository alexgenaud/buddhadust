					<p class="f4 ctr">"As ye sow, so shall ye reap."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In this <a href="naya_the_method.htm">method</a>, because it is based on a perceived 'law of nature' called 'kamma', which speaks about acts as carrying consequences primarily of importance to the one doing the deed, ethical culture is dictated by self-interest, not some authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">While Good Deeds produce kamma the consequences of which are experienced as <a href="sensation.htm">pleasant sensations</a>, in this system, ethical behavior produces kamma the consequences of which are experienced as <a href="sensation.htm">neither pleasant nor unpleasant sensations</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here ethical culture is always the abstention from an act that would produce bad kamma, as such the implied intention is toward the Ending of kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here there is no bad kamma from deeds of omission, no matter how compelling, or no matter how much the culture of the times might dictate the opposite.</p>

					<p class="f4">If 'doing deeds' were required, the goal of ending kamma could not be attained.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Acts are produced by an individual through three modes:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Imagining</b>, or mental wishing or willing or intending.<br />
					<b>Word Thought and Speech</b> (first you mutter to yourself, and then, we shudder to think of it, you speak)<br />
					<b>Bodily Acts</b> (unbend bent arm, bend unbent arm)</p>

					<p class="f4">The Intent behind the act determines the <a href="sensation.htm">Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Not-Pleasant-But-Not-Unpleasant</a> outcome in terms of subjective experience.<br />
					One Intends to produce Pleasant sensations, or Unpleasant Sensations, or to End kamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The first steps in <a href="naya_the_method.htm#p8dway">The Aristocratic Multidimensional Way</a> after <a href="high_working_hypothesis.htm">High View</a> are discussions of Ethical Culture, and in some ways the entire <a href="naya_the_method.htm">system</a> can be seen as a system of higher Ethical Culture.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Buddhist Order, there are more than 200 rules of conduct ... However, one time a Beggar came to the Buddha and said that he was unable to remember so many rules and consequently feared falling off the <a href="naya_the_method.htm">Path</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha asked him if he thought he could remember three rules.</p>

					<p class="f4">He said he could.</p>

					<p class="f4">So for the purposes of introducing Ethical Culture, while not discouraging the newcomer with excessive rules, here are the Three Rules:</p>

					<p class="f4 c">1. Train yourself to abstain from intentional harm to living creatures<br />
					2. Train yourself to abstain from intentionally saying that which is not true<br />
					3. Train yourself to abstain from intentionally taking things that have not been given to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In your Imaginings, Word Thought and Speech, and Bodily Acts.</p>

					<h4><a id="Occupations">Occupations</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">A Lay Follower should avoid these five Occupations:</p>

					<p class="f4">What Five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dealing in weapons,<br />
					selling human beings,<br />
					raising livestock for slaughter or any other occupation that requires slaughter of animals,<br />
					selling alcohol,<br />
					and selling poisons.</p>

					<h4>Paths Leading Upward</h4>

					<p class="f4">There are these Three Paths<br />
					Leading Upward<br />
					Following which one<br />
					Goes Upward starting from the first Step<br />
					1. For the Liar, there is Speaking Truth<br />
					2. For the Bloody Handed, there is Harmlessness<br />
					3. For the Thief, there is not Stealing</p>

					<h4>Ethical Culture in Detail as lived By Gotama, The Awake</h4>

					<p class="f2">From: Digha Nikaya <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Sutta 1,</a> Brahmajala Sutta: The BrahmaNet Spell as translated from the Pali by obo</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of taking life, the shaman Gotama lives abstaining from life-taking. Giving up stick and sword, considerate, compassionate, concerned for the good of all living beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of taking what has not been given, the shaman Gotama lives abstaining from taking what has not been given. He lives clean-handed, accepting what is given, waiting for what is given, refraining from theft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of carnal indulgence, the shaman Gotama lives separated from family life, above participating in sexual matters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of lies and deception, the shaman Gotama lives abstaining from intentional untruth. A straight-talker, one whose word can be counted on, one whose word can be trusted, dependable, no deceiver of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of malicious speech, he does not repeat in one place what he has heard in another place to the disadvantage of anyone. He makes peace between those with differences and he encourages the peace of those who are friends.  Rejoicing in peace, loving peace, delighting in peace, he is one whose words speak up for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go harsh language, he abstains from from abusive speech. He speaks words that are blameless, pleasing to the ear, agreeable, penetrating to and vibrating in the heart, urbane, pori, words that charm and enchant the people.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go idle talk, he knows the right time to speak, he says only what is true and to the point, speaking about the Dhamma and Discipline, words to be treasured, well-reasoned, well-defined, connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas some shamans and Brahmins, while living on the food of the faithful, continue to cultivate such crops as are propagated from roots, from trunks, from limbs, from leaves, from seeds, the shaman Gotama abstains from such injury to plant life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas some shamans and Brahmins, while feeding on the food of the faithful, continue to enjoy the use of stored possessions such as meat and other foods, drink, clothing, carriages, beds, and perfumes, the shaman Gotama abstains from from such enjoyments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas some shamans and Brahmins continue to indulge in argument and contention, using such phrases as:</p>

					"How could someone like you know about this Dhamma?"<br />
					"You hold wrong view.<br />
					It is I who have right view."<br />
					"I am speaking to the point, you are not."<br />
					"You are putting last what ought to come first,<br />
					and first what ought to come last."<br />
					"What you've been expounding so long,<br />
					is completely disproved."<br />
					"Your challenge has been met."<br />
					"You are proved to be wrong."<br />
					"Straighten up your act."<br />
					"Get out of this one if you can."</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas some shamans and Brahmins continue to do such things as running errands and carrying messages for such as kings, ministers, nobles, Brahmins, householders and young men who say: 'Go here — go there! Take this there — bring that from there!' the shaman Gotama abstains from from running errands and carrying messages,</p>
