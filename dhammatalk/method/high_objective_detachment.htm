					<h1>High Objective Detachment</h1>

					<p class="f4">To the degree you are able to see<br />
					<a href="high_vision.htm">Downbound Confounded Rebounding Conjuration</a><br />
					or <a href="high_working_hypothesis.htm">The Four Aristocrats of Truths</a><br />
					at work in the world around you<br />
					to that degree you will have attained freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, after a long long time,<br />
					but sooner or later<br />
					there's going to come a time<br />
					when the end is in sight for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time you need to understand<br />
					that that ability to see<br />
					Downbound Confounded Rebounding Conjuration<br />
					or The Four Aristocrats of Truths<br />
					at work in the world around you,<br />
					comes by way of a vehicle,<br />
					a device constructed to bring you<br />
					from your ordinary life<br />
					to the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that vehicle,<br />
					for the last leg of this journey,<br />
					must be let go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, this system is that vehicle<br />
					and that vehicle would have brought you<br />
					to this point<br />
					by one or perhaps more than one<br />
					of a limitless number<br />
					of paths<br />
					and this point would be<br />
					just a tad up passed<br />
					the First Knowing,<br />
					Second Knowing,<br />
					Third Knowing,<br />
					Fourth Knowing,<br />
					The Realm of Space,<br />
					The Realm of Consciousness,<br />
					The Realm of No Things There,<br />
					The Realm of Neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					and a passle of delightful heavons.</p>

					<p class="f4">From there you would enter<br />
					upon a state of mind called<br />
					'The Ending of Sensation and Perception'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, sooner or later<br />
					you will need to emerge from that one too.</p>

					<p class="f4">And reflecting on this state of mind,<br />
					which was higher<br />
					and deeper<br />
					and broader<br />
					and more exquisite<br />
					and sublime<br />
					than any of those states that came before,<br />
					thinking:<br />
					'but all those states were products of mind,<br />
					constructions, things that were put together,<br />
					and what I know from having seen for myself<br />
					is that whatsoever has been put together,<br />
					is constructed, is a product of mind,<br />
					whatsoever it is, it comes to an end<br />
					... but this mental state too,<br />
					this 'Ending of Sensation and Perception'<br />
					is also a product of mind,<br />
					is also constructed,<br />
					has also been put together<br />
					... and as such it too<br />
					will come to an end<br />
					... but as for me,<br />
					I push this thing much further<br />
					and I'm likely to end up<br />
					more bound up than I was before,<br />
					how about if I just quit<br />
					all this constucting of mental states?'<br />
					do just that.</p>

					<p class="f4">And see:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This body, born of mother and father,<br />
					sustained by milk and rice,<br />
					subject to wearing away,<br />
					breaking up<br />
					and breaking down<br />
					whose destiny is the charnal ground;<br />
					this consciousness<br />
					of 'me'<br />
					is bound up in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way<br />
					as a man with eyes in his head that can see<br />
					could see it<br />
					if there were a perfecty translucent,<br />
					perfectly clear<br />
					multi-faceted gem<br />
					strung on a brightly colored string.<br />
					He could see<br />
					that that string<br />
					was bound up in that gem<br />
					that gem<br />
					downbound by that string.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, see:</p>

					<p class="f4">This body, born of mother and father,<br />
					sustained by milk and rice,<br />
					subject to wearing away,<br />
					breaking up<br />
					and breaking down<br />
					whose destiny is the charnal ground;<br />
					this consciousness<br />
					of 'me'<br />
					is bound up in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is being free.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And in freedom<br />
					recognizing freedom<br />
					is freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And recognize that<br />
					<a href="birth.htm">birth</a> has been left behind, and</p>

					<p class="f4">Duty's doing has been done, and</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no more this side or that, and</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no more being any kind of an "it"<br />
					at any place of "atness" left for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's something like<br />
					a clear deep pool<br />
					in a high mountain crag<br />
					and taking his stand next to it,<br />
					a man with eyes in his head that can see,<br />
					and there he sees<br />
					small pebbles<br />
					and shellfish<br />
					and small creatures<br />
					and small schools of fish<br />
					and once in a while<br />
					even some big fish swimming around.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is no stand<br />
					that is higher or deeper<br />
					or broader<br />
					or more exquisite<br />
					or more sublime<br />
					than this stand.</p>
