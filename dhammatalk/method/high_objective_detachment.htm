					<h1>High Objective Detachment</h1>

						<p class="f4 in1">So seeing <a href="high_vision.htm">(High Vision),</a> act accordingly.<br />
						Seeing the arising of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge and sense experience;<br />
						seeing the ending of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge and sense experience;<br />
						understanding that this seeing and all those mental states that came before are confounded,<br />
						made up of parts,<br />
						subject to breaking a-part,<br />
						ending,<br />
						resolve<br />
						(and do not just resolve, but actually do it)<br />
						to let go of confounding mental states<br />
						and by that<br />
						attain the uttermost objective detachment possible,<br />
						and at that point,<br />
						seeing that this is being free,</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">In freedom recognize freedom, and</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Recognize that<br />
					birth has been left behind, and</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Recognize that<br />
					duty's doing has been done, and</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Recognize that<br />
					there is no more this side or that, and</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Recognize that<br />
					there is no more being any kind of an "it"<br />
					at any place of "atness" left for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's something like<br />
					a clear deep pool<br />
					in a high mountain crag<br />
					and taking his stand next to it,<br />
					a man with eyes in his head that can see,<br />
					and there he sees<br />
					small pebbles<br />
					and shellfish<br />
					and small creatures<br />
					and small schools of fish<br />
					and once in a while<br />
					even some big fish swimming around.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is no stand<br />
					that is higher or deeper<br />
					or broader<br />
					or more exquisite<br />
					or more sublime<br />
					than this stand.</p>
