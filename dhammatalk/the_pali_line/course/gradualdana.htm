					<p class="f4">The first setting into practice of the Buddha's system for the absolute beginner is the cultivation of a habit of generosity — <i>dāna:</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dana.htm"><span class="c"><b>Giving.</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Pali is based on what we might call a "Law of Physics" called <a id="kamma">kamma</a> (Sanskrit: Karma).<br />
					The Pali view of kamma is different from the various Hindu views as well as from the Golden Rule.<br />
					The Pali view holds that:</p>

					<p class="f4 in1"><b><i>The resulting consequence of an action<br />
					depends on the power of the actor,<br />
					the power of the deed, and<br />
					the power of the recipient of the deed.</i></b>.</p>

						<div class="floatlpp wpx250 mart6">
							<p>Think of the planning of the general verusus the actual fighting of the soldier — the act of greater significance is the planning of the general. Additionally, no deed can be performed without first having been conceived of by mind.</p>

							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">The power of the deed is proportional to its ability to assist the recipient along the path toward <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upekkha.htm">detachment</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore deeds of mind are the most powerful,<br />
					deeds of word and body are less powerful.</p>

					<p class="f4">The western practitioner needs to understand the criteria for a "deed of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">A passing thought is not a deed of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a deed of mind to take place there must be <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/manosancetana.htm">intent</a> attached.</p>

					<p class="f4">"O,O,O, If Only Such and So were So and Such".</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of the actor and the recipient is proportional to the clarity of their minds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clarity of mind is proportional to the detachment of the individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does clarity of mind influence the outcome of a deed?<br />
					One can understand this in a very ordinary way: given a complex task and two individuals to perform it, which would you expect to complete the task successfully: the muddle-head or the clear thinker?<br />
					This is how it works: The attached mind is necessarily biased and therefore unclear and of divided power.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c"><i><b>"The wishes of the virtuous, beggars,<br />
					come to fruition because of their clarity."</b></i></p>

					<p class="f1 ctr">— <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.33.08.olds.bd.htm#p8.7">DN 33.8</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Pali holds that<br />
					<b><i>there is no doing of an intentional deed without experiencing consequences therefrom</i></b>.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the consequences of a deed are subjectively experienced in accordance with the intent of the deed and the mental state of the individual at the time of the experience of a deed's consequences.</p>

					<p class="f4">This allows for both the alteration of the subjective experience of the outcome of a deed and the subjective escape from kamma altogether through the alteration of one's mental state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Alteration of one's mental state can be accomplished by compensatory behavior or a change in attitude or orientation or point of view concerning that which constitutes the self. Kamma which was to be experienced as bodily sensation does not reach the individual who no longer identifies with body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Two similes are given:</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">Take the case, beggars, of a rich man who steals a poor farmer's pig,<br />
							and take the case of the poor farmer who steals a rich merchant's pig.</p>

							<p  class="f3 in2">What is the case here?</p>

							<p  class="f3 in2">When the poor farmer steals the rich merchant's pig and is caught, he is beaten to within an inch of his life and is made to pay for the pig as well.</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">When the rich man steals the poor farmer's pig and is caught, the poor farmer begs the rich man to pay him back and maybe he is compensated and maybe he is not.</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">And, take the case, Beggars, of a small cup of water into which is placed a large spoonful of salt,<br />
							and take the case of a large barrel of fresh rain water into which is place a large spoonful of salt.</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">What is the case here?</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">When the large spoonful of salt is placed into the small cup of water, it renders the water undrinkable, but when the large spoonful of salt is placed into the large barrel of fresh rain water it is hardly noticed if at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unless it leads to <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nekkhamma.htm">giving up</a>, giving necessarily involves activity which precludes it from being a complete path to detachment. The primary purpose of giving <i>in this system</i> is the creation of good kamma for the purposes of attaining calm.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i><b>The primary purpose of the Pali is not the creation of good kamma</b></i> or calm, but the escape from kamma which is an achievement greatly assisted by the state of calm, detached observation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having the idea that one has some good kamma out there instills confidence and supports calm detached observation.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is very handy for those times when one catches a glimpse of the fact that without some good deeds on the books, one is skating on thin ice and the sun is out. <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/uddhacca-kukkucca.htm">Fear and trembling</a> are <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">hindrances</a> in the Pali.</p>

					<p class="f4">So practice giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strive to become a Master Giver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not rely on the tired old thought:<br />
					"I am already a very generous person!"</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no act of giving which is insignificant.</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">"Why, Beggars, if one were to scrape the dishes into the sewers with the idea of feeding the small creatures that are living there, that would not be without fruit." [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p57">AN 3.57</a>]</p>

					Give to teachers<br />
					Give to beggars and sorcerers of good moral habits.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<div class="inbdr wpc80">

							<p>Giving to the self is another concept which will appear strange to the Western mind, but which is central to the Pali way of thinking — that is, that the self should be treated like any other person, or an old friend. For one thing, giving to yourself, you will learn what is and what is not good to give.</p>

							<p><b>Setting Priorities</b></p>

							<p>There is no overt statement made by Gotama concerning setting priorities. What there is is consistancy in the order in which the doing of deeds (e.g., giving) is listed.</p>

							<p>That the self comes first is to be understood this way:</p>

							<p>When it comes to the Essentials of Food, Clothing, Medicine, and Shelter, the self should be provided for first because the self is essential for providing for the rest. Exactly the opposite is the case when it comes to non-essentials in which case the order is less important and is usually dictated by opportunity. It is certainly wise that the self give to the self first in the case of something unknown so that the benefits and disadvantages can be known before taking further action.</p>

							<p>The other groups can be rationalized this way:</p>

							<p>One's mate and children come next because they provide the stability and survival of the family.</p>

							<p>The parents come next because of their role as creators of the family. The parents have given what cannot be repaid, that is, life, and should be treated with the respect and gratitude due the doers of that deed, this regardless of the goodness of their conduct.</p>

							<p>Friends, servants and employees come next in a more or less reasonable progression from the previous.</p>

							<p>Teachers, beggars and sorcerers of good moral habits come last. Considering that teachers and the rest are likely to give one advice that vastly improves life, or, if they are, in fact, powerful in terms of detachment, they will be the proximate cause of huge kammic returns, the question is, why last? I believe this is largely a matter of modesty on the part of the conveyer of this list who would have been a teacher, a beggar or a sorcerer. These people are always cautious to guard against the idea that they are teaching for profit which would be a conclusion reasonably reached if they put themselves first. Of course the idea that if the essentials are not provided to the self first there will be no self to give to the rest still applies here, and, additionally, the beggar, etc., who put himself before the rest would be subject to criticism from the rest and this is to be avoided as an unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the society of the Buddha's time, it was considered proper behavior to accept a gift (or agree to any proposition) by silence — it was only if the gift or proposition was objected to that one would speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was a consequence partly of the belief in kamma, where the giver was the primary beneficiary of the act of giving, but the custom was also based on a respect for the value of few words.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand, the custom for the giver was to offer a gift this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May the good sir accept this gift from me<br />
					as a favor to me."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There was a tradition in the Buddha's day of expressing thanks at the end of a meal, so we can assume that there was no reason not to say "Thank You." However, the beggars were cautioned not to be too effusive in their thanks lest it be interpreted as a hint that they wanted more.</p>

					<p class="f4">While one should give without attachment as to the consequence, it is also praised that one give with the outcome clearly in mind. It is possible to balance these two.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are many instances mentioning the progression of ambitions desired, beginning from the wish to be reborn in this world as a wealthy individual to being reborn in one or another of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#realms">the heaven worlds</a> to giving simply to clarify the mind and heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives without attachment because the most powerful single factor in the making of a deed of magic (and giving to attain an outcome of any sort is conjuring, or magic) is <b>Letting Go</b>. You need to release the wish. Let the intent find it's own way to work itself out. If you try to control the outcome you are assuming a role beyond your scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand, to give without thought is likened to carelessness — <i>pamāda</i>.</p>
