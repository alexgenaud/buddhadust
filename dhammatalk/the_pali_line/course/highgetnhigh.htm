					<h4><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">There are two reasons for the practice of 'sitting': for the seeker it brings to fulfillment the two-sided effort at obtaining freedom: calm and insight; for the master it is a pleasant way to pass the time in this seen thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Serenity in this system is described as:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Appaṇihita:</i> having no point, aimless<br />
					<i>Animitta:</i> leaving no traces, signs, tracks, signatures<br />
					<i>Suññatta:</i> being empty of lust, anger and blindness</p>

					<p class="f4">The highest stages of serenity are called <i>'jhānas,'</i> a word which means 'burning' or 'shining' with knowledge. It is the root of the English word 'knowing', of the Chinese word 'Chan', and of the Japanese word 'Zen.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There are different <i>jhānas</i> in different systems, and there are eight or nine or ten <i>jhānas</i> in this system depending on how one classifies certain states of mind. <i>'Jhāna'</i> is just a word used to act as a guide through a progression of changes which actually have no clear-cut boundaries. One should not get too hung up on terminology.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the eighth dimension of the Aristocratic Eight Dimensional High Way, High Serenity is defined in terms of four <i>jhānas</i> which describe a progression from just above worldly involvement to complete detachment. In one form or another, this is the end point of every practice in the system. Every 'Dhamma' or unit of the system, worthy of the term ends in the detachment defined in the fourth of these <i>jhānas</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The single most important thing to keep in mind in thinking about or practicing <i>jhāna</i> is that it is a progression where letting go is the mechanism of action. As the subtitle of this section indicates, in a quote from Sariputta, this is the practice of cultivating higher mental states by way of letting go of lower mental states.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For the seeker aiming at bringing to fulfillment the two-sided effort at obtaining freedom: calm and insight, the purpose of this form of mental culture is that hinted at in the term "getting high".<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> From a height a wide view is possible — this is the condition allowing for insight that we are seeking — from the highest height one can step off or out of it all, let it all go — letting go is the establishment of calm we are seeking.</p>

					<p class="f4">With a wide view, above it all, it is easy to see the essential point of the Buddha's Teaching: That there is nothing there that is not <a href="gradualesson5.htm#ANICCA">inconsistent,</a> constantly changing; that Pain (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dukkha.htm">DUKKHA</a>) is the consequence of change where one is attached to things the way they are, and that, because it changes and is painful, there is nothing there that can justify being called the 'Self' of one. So seeing letting go is not difficult. [He said.]</p>

					<p class="f4">So then, finally,<br />

					<h4>Last Word on Serenity Practice</h4>

					<p class="f4">Serenity is not the goal. The recognition of freedom in detachment available from the fourth <i>jhāna</i> is the goal. This adaptation of the last section of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p112">MN 112</a> describes what is to be done with the fourth <i>jhāna:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with calm heart, pure, clean, debtless, without afflictions, become soft, capable, steadfast, unshakable,
					bent down to knowledge of the eradication of the corruptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Know: 'This is pain',<br />
					know: 'This is the source of pain',<br />
					know: 'This is the end to pain',<br />
					know: 'This is the way to walk to the end of pain'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Know: 'This is corruption',<br />
					know: 'This is the source of corruption',<br />
					know: 'This is the end to corruption',<br />
					know: 'This is the way to walk to the end of corruption'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when you know this, see this, know you are<br />
					freed in heart from the corruption of sense pleasures,<br />
					freed in heart from the corruption of living,<br />
					freed in heart from the corruption of blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom think: "I am free' and know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth: left behind,<br />
					carrying on as Brahma: finished,<br />
					duty's doing: done,<br />
					no further it'n-n-at'n is to be known for me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, my friends,<br />
					thus knowing, seeing,<br />
					with regard to this body with consciousness<br />
					and all external signs,<br />
					I say that 'Bias towards me- my-making is uprooted.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There is a huge battle in the literature concerning the issue of whether or not the <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for the attainment of Arahantship. The debate boils down to one side rigidly holding on to a set of terms and the instructions that appear throughout the suttas about attaining the <i>jhānas</i> in order to attain Arahantship, and the other side ridgidly holding on to situations found in the suttas in which Arahantship was apparently attained without the <i>jhānas</i> or after attaining only one of them.<br />
					There is a better way to deal with this: understanding that the term <i>'jhāna'</i> and specifically the four <i>jhānas</i> are a description of what happens at the boarder between the world and Nibbāna. Looking at that stretch of territory one way one can discriminate discrete stages and name them <i>jhānas</i>, looking at the same phenomena from the perspective of having gone from the beginning point to the end point in a single leap encompassing all the stages too quickly to discriminate the discrete stages one cannot apply the terms that describe the middle points. Snap fingers, no <i>jhānas</i>. <i>Jhāna</i> is just a word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The subtlest and most difficult to get rid of obstacle to attaining the <i>jhānas</i> is ambition to attain the <i>jhānas</i>. It is necessary to keep at it and that requires ambition, but if the ambition is for the attainment of the <i>jhānas</i> it becomes an obstacle to the goal. Just keep the mind focused on letting go.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The idea and term 'High' is an old religious term adopted by the drug culture, not a drug culture term being adopted to religious use. I say this for political correctness. In fact what the drug culture is calling 'getting high' is the phenomena we are here calling <i>'samādhi',</i> 'sereity'. There is the matter of content, objective, degree of refinement and the matter of the ability to attain the states without dependence on externals that makes the difference.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Saṭi.</i> There are three primary terms used in the Pali for the center of mental activity all currently being translated 'mind'. Here what is intended is the mind in its function as the memory, attention, minding, recollection, recollectedness, reflection, self-awareness, remembering, and such ideas. When the term used in English is 'mind' what is being referred to is the intellect, the ability to analyze, think, and understand through ideas, reasoning, insight, intuition. When the term used in English is 'heart' it is using this term with emphasis on the idea of 'center' over that of the organ and is mind in it's functions of experiencing mental states or conditions, moods, emotions, empathy, intuition, insight. Other terms are also used for various mental functions and there is blurring of the boundaries.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> 'Enter into' means, having followed the instructions to this point one has attained the <i>jhāna</i> — not that having done the previous one should now look for something else that is the <i>jhāna</i> into which one is now ready to enter. I need to say this. There are people out there who cannot take the descriptions of the <i>jhānas</i> at face value and looking for something that isn't there and not finding it, declare the <i>jhānas</i> no longer possible to attain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> You going to argue about that?</p>
