					<h3 class="ctr c">The Destruction of the corruptions</h3>

					<p class="f4">And again, with your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of the knowledge of the destruction of the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm">āsavas,</a> the corrupting influences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Normally, this <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm">Dhamma</a> (unit of the teaching), that is, The Gradual Course and the instructions on developing the mind, goes right into the destruction of the āsavas: the destruction of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kama.htm">pleasure-seeking</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/bhava.htm">becomming, living, being,</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/avijja.htm">blindness,</a> essentially saying "he destroys wanting, living, and blindness."</p>

					<p class="f4">While this is reasonable as an instruction for someone face-to-face with the Buddha, who, having heard in some way or another all of what has preceded in <a href="table_of_contents.htm">this Course</a>, having been, as it were, lifted by hand to this point, it is a reasonable assumption that this course taught here has had somewhat less powerful result — so essentially this section is going to start again using the Tenth Question as the structure.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tenth Question describes the <a id="ASIKKHA">Asikkha</a> path: The Path taken by one who is no longer seeking: The walk that is both seen and lived. The destruction of the <i>āsavas</i> entails "seeing" this path as it really is, and then letting go.</p>

					<h1><a id="THETENTHLESSON">The Tenth Lesson</a></h1>

					<p class="f4">Dasa Nama Kim? What is ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten concepts, when seen to the root with penetrating knowledge, and understood to the broadest limits, such that their repellant nature is seen as it really is and one has released them in their entirety, can bring one to the uttermost freedom of detachment?</p>

					<h3 class="ctr c">Dasah'angehi samannagato araha ti pavuccati.</h3>

					<p class="f4"><i>Dasa</i> = ten, a complete sphere [hold two hands up palms facing with fingertips of opposing hands touching], or a complete circle [hold two hands up palms out connecting thumbs and forefingers].</p>

					<h3 class="ctr c">Any Beggar with ten fingers can call himself an arahant.</h3>

					<h3><span class="f7 c">1.</span> <a id="SAMMADITTHI">Sammā Diṭṭhi:</a> High View</h3>

					<p class="f4">This is from a discussion of <i>vitaka</i> and <i>vicara</i>,(the internal dialogue):</p>

					<p class="f4">AP: <i>"The dialogue I perceive appears to be behind the apparent division of peoples, and, if that division is a always a product of ignorance, how can that division be seen clearly?"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is what is at the root of the dialogue that is the cause of the apparent division of peoples. That is: the clinging to views, of peoples.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you say "ignorance", I hear you thinking about what you have heard about Buddhism through the literature. In fact, what the Buddha refers to as ignorance: (That is: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/avijja.htm">Avijja</a> = blindness); is a very specific thing: It is the blindness to the truth of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_saccani.htm">The Four Noble Truths,</a> or of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">High View</a>. To see how view masters the common man and causes the divisions between groups, first master High View:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">It is all Painful ugly ukky k-kha.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">The source of that k-kha is hunger/thirst.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">To end the k-kha, end the hunger/thirst.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">This is the way: High Views, High Principles, High Talk, High Works, High Lifestyle, High Self Control, High Memory, High Serenity, High Vision, and High Detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">From High View, all other views are seen clearly.</p>

					<p>Recommended side trip to The Brahma Gala Sutta <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.01.3.olds.bd_dhamma_1.htm">Excerpts on Views</a></p>

					<h4><a id="HighViewinDetail">High View in detail</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Remember: High View, <i>'diṭṭhi',</i> is the "working hypothesis." You are experiencing pain and decide you need to change; this system tells you "this is the way to look at it so as to end that pain"; you adopt this view in order to test it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>This is <a id="Dukkha" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dukkha.htm">dukkha</a></b> [Pain; du-du, uk uk, ka kha]:</p>

						grief and lamentation are dukkha<br />

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jati.htm"><b>Birth</b></a> is the descent into the womb, growth and outcome in being born, the regrouping in a new being of the stockpiles, the appearance of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/salayatana.htm">the six-fold sense spheres</a> of such and such a being in this or that habitat for beings.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jaramarana.htm"><b>Aging</b></a> is the adding to the length of life lived, the deterioration, the falling apart, the rotting away, the withering, wrinkling, the diminishment of the remainder of the lifespan, the getting old of the six-fold sense spheres of such and such a being in this or that habitat for beings.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Death</b> is the fall away, the fall out, the ending, the vanishing, the death, the dying, the finishing of the lifespan, the breaking up of the stockpiles, the laying down of the body, of such and such a being in this or that habitat for beings.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Grief</b> is the condition of inner sadness, heartbreak, heartache, state of missing and regret, woe, and affliction, the grief, feeling bad, wretchedness, state of woe, and unhappiness of such and such a being experiencing some loss or tragedy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Lamentation</b> is the outward expression of mourning, sadness, heartbreak, heartache, state of missing and regret, woe, and affliction, grief, feeling bad, wretchedness, state of woe, and unhappiness of such and such a being experiencing some loss or tragedy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="PainDukkha"><b>Pain</b></a> [<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dukkha.htm">dukkha</a>] is feeling physical pain, bodily pain, pain arising from contact with the body, the being bodily affected by something painful of such and such a being.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Misery</b> is feeling mental pain, pain in the mind, pain arising from contact with the mind, the being affected in mind by something painful of such and such a being.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Despair</b> is the condition of having given up hope, dejection, despondency, depression, of such and such a being.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Not getting what is wished for</b> is in reference to the case when such and such a being wishes: "O,O,O If only I were not subject to birth, aging and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair!" for such is not to be had by wishing.</p>

Daraminpola explains it here as meaning either the second or the third. No doubt Oldenberg is right as to the derivation. But Daraminpola is also right if we take his not as exegetical, not philological. The fact is that the derivation had been, from very early times, forgotten or confused; and the connotation of the word was renunciation generally, with special reference to these two kinds.

					<p class="f4">Talk of kings and ministers of state,<br />
					robbers and thieves,<br />
					the horrors of war and battle;<br />
					talk of food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands and perfumes;<br />

					or at the well<br />
					talk of those alive or of those who are departed;<br />
					talk comparing differences between this and that;<br />
					speculative talk about creation,<br />
					existence or non-existence.</p>

					<h4><a id="WranglingPhrases">Wrangling Phrases</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Abstain from argument and contention, using such phrases as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You clearly don't understand this doctrine and discipline, whereas I do.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">You should, in stead, cite the suttas and explain the passage.</p>

					<p class="f4">'How could someone suchas you understand this doctrine and discipline?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">You can explain the difficulty in understanding a doctrine for a person without any knowledge or experience of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What you are saying is wrong. What I am saying is right.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">You can show where what you are saying is in accordance with sutta, or in accordance with the logic of the argument, or accepted conditions, etc., whereas what he is saying is not. i.e., deal with the issues, not the person.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What I am saying is consistent, what you are saying is not.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">You can present him with his contradictory views and ask for an explanation, or you can explain how two views of yours he thinks are contradictory are in fact not in contradiction.</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have said last what should have been said first and first what should have been said last!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Mostly the order will not matter. Where the order is instructive or critical you can explain why.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What you have argued for so long has been refuted!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Probably many times if it is incorrect and therefore to point this out is useless talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your challenge has been met and you have been defeated!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If this is the case it does not need to be said.</p>

					<p class="f4">'How will you get out of this one?<br />
					Answer me that one, you!'</p>

								<p>The little scraps of verse found throughout the Suttas are considered by me to be the oldest examples of Dhamma (others hold the opposite view). I believe it is likely that they are older in that the tradition of the time was to debate using the form and style of one's opponent, and debate using verse was and still is a popular style. The prose would be an explanation that followed. The general rule as I gather it from the suttas is to use the same form as is used by the challenger — nothing you can do can upset me, or cause me to lose my balance or control of my mastery of mind. A spirit of one-upmanship which is almost incomprehensible today. Some of these debates in the suttas had deadly consequences — some were hilarious. One who did not answer the reasonable question of a Buddha, asked three times in succession, would find his head split into seven parts — there comes a point, when faced with the real truth while holding on to a false truth, that the mind breaks apart on the ego holding it together — the reasonable aspects of the mind simply fly off.</p>

										<p>In this paragraph we get a look at the heavy duty meditator at work. The commentary here suggests this "concentration mark" (<a id="SAMADHINIMMITA"><i>samādhi-nimmita</i></a>) is what is called "the reflex image", the mental image of an object off of which one has gotten High. I believe it should be understood in it's purer form as an object fit to remind one of the eventual fate of living beings. Generally speaking the Buddha does not suggest the use of devices for getting high or for working magic, but there are several places in the Suttas where meditating on "the foul" or "death" is suggested and in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/01_ones/an01.394-494.olds.bd.htm#p455">The Book of the Ones</a>, at least, he commends the use of kasinas or "<a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/40_kasinas.htm">concentration devices</a>." What we have in this paragraph possibly an older form of the use of concentration devices. In practice what happens is that one wanting, say, to go through a wall imagines a hole in the wall and walks through it. This over time became the practice of using a board with a hole in it (the <i>kasina</i>) to focus (develop the ability to vividly imagine the hole), and the mental image of the hole became the <i>samādhi-nimmita</i>. In other words the practice went from spontaneous generation of whatever was needed to a concretized formula. This is important to at least consider in that once one has opened the doors to the realm of magical occurrences, the speed with which one reacts to situations is of utmost importance in assuring one's safety under attack, or in coming to the assistance of some other being under attack.</p>

						<div class="inbdr wpc90">
							<p><b>Note on Terminology</b>: As much as the presentation here of this system in English is unorthodox, I have very rarely deviated from a basis in the orthodox Pali. When there is a deviation, as will occur here, it is necessary to point this out so that the reader can judge for himself the merits of so doing.</p>

							<p>The last two "folds" of the Eightfold Path when found with ten folds usually have <i>"sammā ñaṇa"</i> and <i>"sammā vimutti"</i> as the final two folds. The presentation here is based on using <i>"sammā vijja"</i> and <i>"sammā upekkha"</i>.</p>

							<p>On this issue see: the definition of <i>ñaṇa</i> as <i>"tiso vijjā"</i> at Vin III.91 (which, however, PED doubts is genuine); and S V.x.ii#16, pp 335 (PTS: Monks b, V.295; WP: Bhikkhus 2, II.1786) where the term <i>"vijja-vimutti"</i> is used and Woodward translates "knowledge and release".</p>

							<p>The choices made here are synonyms and do not conflict with the intent of the suttas, and the meanings as described are the same as the suttas. These choices were made in order to clearly delineate in this presentation of the Dhamma a three-stage process that is not clear in most presentations of the system:</p>

							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/sign_1.5.gif" width="19" height="36" alt="sign #1" /> The pre-Streamwinner (sometimes characterized as a Streamwinner) can know the Dhamma and have a clear intellectual understanding of it's principles without having any vision of what it really means. I call this "knowledge," or "book knowledge" and for this I use the Pali: <i>"ñaṇa"</i>.</p>

							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/sign_2.5.gif" width="23" height="36" alt="sign #2" /> The post-Streamwinner, pre-Arahant, can have knowledge of the Dhamma and see how it works and what it really means, but has not yet attained its goals. I call this having "knowledge and vision" or "knowing and seeing" <i>(ñaṇa and dassana)</i> and this is also sometimes called "The Eye of Dhamma" or sometimes "The Ear of Dhamma"</p>

							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/sign_3.5.gif" width="25" height="36" alt="sign #3" /> The Arahant knows the Dhamma, sees it as it really is, and has attained its' goal.</p>

							<p>In English, this requires three terms: one for the knowledge, one for the seeing as it is, and one for the attained state.</p>

							<p>In the suttas there is a very broad (and sometimes confusing) use for the term <i>"ñaṇa"</i> such that I feel justified in confining it to the lowly "Book Knowledge" or the "knowledge" as described above.</p>

							<p>This leaves me needing a single term for the condition following <i>sammā samādhi</i> which describes one who knows and sees, as really is, the <i>diṭṭhi</i> of <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (the problem solved in the suttas by using <i>"ñaṇa"</i>, which leaves us asking where did the <i>dassana</i> of the post-Streamwinner pre Arahant go?)</p>

							<p>This is the point of the 9th fold; <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (samma #1) is the theoretical knowledge, sammaa #9 is actually knowing it by seeing it, as is evidence by the fact that it is, in this position put in terms of the <i>paṭicca samupada</i>. So I have used <i>Vijja</i> (vision); I could have used <i>diṭṭha</i>, or <i>dassana</i> but <i>vijja</i> fits in more with my magical take on the system.</p>

							<p>I have used <i>"Upekkha"</i> as the final term over <i>"vimutti"</i> (release) in the belief that <i>"Upekkha,"</i> translated as "Detachment," more clearly points out the need for the final step of letting go in order to attain <i>vimutti</i>, or <i>Nibbāna</i>, or being <i>Akalika</i> (outside Time), or having brought a final end to <i>dukkha</i>. <i>Upekkha</i> is also the term used most frequently in this <i>function</i> in suttas that are not describing the actual <i>Asikha Pada or Magga.</i></p>

							<p><i>'Upekkha'</i> has this problem: it is most frequently translated 'equanimity'. This is just wrong. Equanimity is a state of mind in a being still attached to the world and <i>Upekkha</i> when it is used is being used as a term for the Arahant. It means 'detached.'</p>

							<p>I hope readers will accept these changes as conditioned by the particular needs of the English language and not as any indication that the original instruction may be lacking.</p>

							<p>And finally: Why make the change in the Pali at all? Why not just use the English terms I want and leave the Pali and say: that's how I am translating the terms <i>ñaṇa and vimutti</i>? Because it is the effort here to create a bridge between our English understanding and the original Pali. This way the original Pali remains accessable to those doing their dhamma vicaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any aging, sickness, death; grief and lamentation; pain and misery; and despair if there were no birth of any sort, by any sort of being in any sort of realm of being?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any aging, sickness, death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair if there were no birth of any sort by any being in any realm of being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore aging, sickness, death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair arise as a consequence of birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any birth of any sort, by any sort of being in any sort of realm of being, if there were no living of any kind by any kind of being in any sort of realm of being?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any birth, by any being, in any realm of being, if there were no living of any kind by any kind of being in any realm of being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore birth arises as a consequence of living.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any living of any kind by any kind of being in any sort of realm of being if there were no "Going after getting life" by any kind of being in any sort of realm of being?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any living of any kind by any being in any realm of being if there were no "going after getting life" by any being in any realm of being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore living arises as a consequence of going after getting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any going after getting if there were no wanting to get?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could be no going after getting if there were no wanting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any kind of wanting (wanting to get pleasure, wanting to end pain, wanting to live, wanting to live again, wanting to end living) if there were no experience of sensations of pleasure or pain or neither pleasure nor pain at any one of the six organs of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any kind of wanting if there were no experience of sensations of pleasure, pain or neither pleasure nor pain at any one (or more) of the six organs of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore wanting arises as a consequence of sensation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any experience of pleasure or pain or neither pleasure nor pain at any of the six organs of sense if there were no contact of any kind by any organ of sense with any object of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any experience of pleasure or pain or neither pleasure nor pain at any of the six sense organs if there were no contact by any organ with any object.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore sensation arises as a consequence of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any contact of any organ of sense with any object of sense if there were no sense organs?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any contact of any organ of sense with any object of sense if there were no sense organs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore contact arises as a consequence of the sixfold realm of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could the sixfold realm of the senses exist without named form? [Named Form because what is being described is the identification or naming of a shape. Without a shape there is no name, without a name a shape has no identification]</p>

					<p class="f4">No, the sixfold realm of the senses could not exist without named forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the Sixfold Realm of the Senses arises as a consequence of Named Form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any named forms without consciousness (awareness of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and ideas)?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any named forms of any sort whatsoever if there were no consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore named form arise as a consequence of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any arising of consciousness of experience through the senses if there were no identification (implanting of "self" awareness by way of the intent to create experience for the self) with the doing of acts of mind, word-thought-and-speech, or body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Remember: consciousness is not the self. The self does not possess consciousness. The self is not in consciousness. Consciousness is not an aspect of self. The self is not a consciousness that continues from one life to the next. Self-consciousness arises as a result of conditions. An individual, with belief in self, conscious, with desire, acting on that desire with the mind by wishing or willing or intending, through word-thought-and speech, or with bodily actions, thinking "I will be...or I will get" puts together by such acts the named forms and consciousness that results in awareness (consciousness as an individuality) of sense experience in the future conjoined with the idea of "me" or "my".</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could not be any arising of individualized consciousness of experience through the senses if there were no identification with doing acts of mind, word-thought-and speech, or body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore individualized consciousness arises as a consequence of own-making, personalization, confounding, identification.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be any arising of own-making of any sort whatsoever if it were not for blindness by individuals as to the correctness of this formula and it's implications?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, there could be no arising of own-making of any sort whatsoever if it were not for blindness by individuals as to the outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore own-making arises as a consequence of blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore this is the ending of aging and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair, that is, ending blindness.</p>
