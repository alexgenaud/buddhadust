					<h4><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a href="highgetnhigh.htm#fourth_burning">The Fourth Burning</a> is, in effect, the highest point <i>in the World</i> in the Buddhist view.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two stages that follow that are better than this: The Burning known as "<a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#EndingofPerceptionandSensation">The Ending of Sensation-Perception</a>" which is a burning associated with the actual process of letting go of The World, and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nibbana.htm">Nibbāna</a> itself, which is the condition left after the World has been Let Go completely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certain other conditions are attainable which are not "higher" than the fourth burning, but which are certainly extraordinary.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the attainment of skills of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm">"small magic",</a><br />
					attainment of the four immaterial burnings,<br />
					knowledge of former "habitations",<br />
					knowledge of the outcome of deeds,<br />
					and knowledge of the destruction of the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm">āsavas</a> [corruptions] which is attained by the Arahat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As with numerous other end-points in the system, an individual with the requisite vision could go directly from the Fourth burning to utter detachment, complete freedom, living outside time, <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMAUPEKKHA">upekkha</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimutti.htm">vimutti,</a> <a href="#AKALIKA">akalika</a>. It is because there are those in the world who have attained, or have partially attained "small magic", the immaterial spheres, knowledge of former habitations, and knowledge of the outcome of deeds, that these topics are covered here. In <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.51.001.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.51.2</a> it is pointed out that whoever neglects the method for attaining magic powers also neglects the way to the end of pain. So while powers like levitating and walking on water need not be attained, one must at least have developed the methods for attaining them: they amount to the same thing as the method for attaining the goal. Further, knowledge of former habitations, knowledge of the outcome of deeds, and knowledge that the corruptions have ended are things that are aspects of the state of Arahantship. They are part of the deal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Initiated Beggars are not allowed to demonstrate skills in "small magic" to lay persons, nor are they allowed to state or suggest that they are able to use these powers. The polite thing in these matters is, therefore, not to ask. There is no rule against laymen using such powers. Those laymen who are tempted however should reflect on the number of people that have ended up tied to a stake with a fire burning under them because they were just suspected of being capable of such things. Sometimes it is better to just keep your mouth shut.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is considerable scorn heaped upon practitioners of "small magic" by the Buddha. This is based on the fact that it is essentially, from the point of view of someone who sees things as they really are, just trickery — in a world made up of illusions, creating illusions that astound the ignorant because of their unconventionality is seen to almost always originate from a desire for gain. To put the enormous effort it takes to achieve such powers to a use such as this rather than to the elimination of pain is seen as foolish. One should approach the learning of these skills as a matter of understanding the world: learn how to do them to the degree that produces <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panna.htm">penetrating knowledge</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimokkha.htm">release</a>.</p>

					<h4><a id="The4PowerPaths" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm">The 4 Little Itty-Biddy Power Paths</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Skills in small magic, and knowledge of former habitations and knowledge of the outcome of deeds are all things which are influenced by the position from which they are attained. As a consequence the method in the Pali is to attain these skills from the <a href="highgetnhigh.htm#FourthBurning">Fourth Burning</a>. This insures that the development of the skill begins from <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMADITTHI">High View</a> and ends in <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMAUPEKKHA">Detachment</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">With that end in mind, the assumption in the instructions is that the practitioner is familiar with and able to enter and exit the <a href="highgetnhigh.htm">Four Burnings</a> in forward and reverse order more or less at will, and, having entered the Fourth Burning, has attained the all-round, clean clear through, bright shinny radiance of detachment. At that point the one who would use powers 'bends down' his mind to the task. This is not the same thing as exiting the jhana's in descending order, it is taking the power of the jhana and directing it to a goal. This is how it can be that from the fourth burning one enters, for example, the Realm of Space, or 'Wish-samadhi', which would appear to be 'lower' (less sublime) states than the forth burnng.</p>

					<p class="f4">Readers who are unfamiliar with personal experience in the actual practice of the techniques described in this <a href="thepaliline.htm#TheGradualCourse">Course</a> may look at some of the "instructions" as to how to attain these magic powers and think that they are not instructions at all. This is a trick we have played: Actually, all the "work" that is usually associated with learning magic powers has already been done by those who have mastered the techniques of the Course to this point: the 'work' is the mastery of the Gradual Training. From the Fourth Burning, it is sufficient to describe what is to be done in precise terms.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/40_kasinas.htm">Using devices</a> such as crystal balls, rodent entrails, magic wands, magic carpets, <a href="../../../backmatter/exercises/earth_kasina.htm">the earth device,</a> the water device, the wind device, and so forth is completely unnecessary, it's all controlled by mind; just do it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what it means when the Buddha speaks of presenting the Dhamma 'stripped of swaddling'. For example: Don Juan describes 'commanding intent' or the spirit [attempting a work of magic power] as only being possible when the sorcerer: <i>"speaks in gestures. And gestures do not mean signs or body movements, but acts of true abandon, acts of largesse, of humor."</i></p>

					<p class="f4">But here, in the Buddha's system, the key is letting go which examination will show is the active ingrediant in true abandon, acts of largesse and humor.</p>

					<p class="f4">What follows concisely states the prerequisite skills for Power:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="SANKHARA" href="gradualesson5.htm#SANKHARA"><b>Sankhara</b></a></p>

					<p class="f4">San=co, con, one, same, with, together with; khara=make, found. Con-struct, co-found, con-fect, con-join, con-jure, own-make...see Glossology: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankhara.htm">Sankhara</a>) The meaning is that one makes a world identified as one's own by co-founding it (I + That).<br />
					"Sankhara" is identification with the intent to create experience for the self by way of thought, word, or deed and it is the identified-with consequence of the action.<br />
					Stated in general terms, the kamma rebounding from <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/avijja.htm">blind</a> sankaraming (so to speak) is <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vinnana.htm">consciousness</a> (self-consciousness, or consciousness as an individuality).</p>

					<p class="f4">Translators of this term tend to use only one side or the other in their translations, limiting the understanding they convey only to the 'activities' involved or relating only to the 'fabrications' that are the result. The idea that this is 'personalization' is almost completely overlooked.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="CHANDA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/chanda.htm">Chanda</a>:</b> Wish, desire, intent (a la Carlos <a href="../../../backmatter/bibliography/bibliography.htm#donJuanSeries">Castaneda</a>), will &gt; chando: metric recitation, chant, enchant, canto, cantor, incantation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Per Castaneda's Don Juan, 'intent' or the 'spirit' is the bridge between the individual and the cosmic force that makes things happen which he leaves as a mystery — Buddhists understand this to be kamma or in it's personal aspect 'sankhara' — consequently it is a combined force made up of willing or wishing and the verbal skills for forming the wish.</p>

							<p class="in2"><b>The first Incantation</b>:</p>

							<p class="in2">There comes a time, Beggars,<br />
							after a long long time,<br />
							when Maha Brahma,<br />
							while contemplating the world,<br />
							thinks to himself:</p>

							<p class="in2">"O, O, O, If only there were light at night,<br />
							in the same way as the sun lights up the day!"</p>

							<p class="in2">And the moon appears. Canda, The Moon. (Incandescent, candle).</p>

					<p class="f4">Today [Friday, March 18, 2005 6:41 AM] (or rather in my father's day) we have the expression 'He moons for her' (today we have the expression he Mooned her, which is something else altogether.)</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an important example of a well made incantation or "Wish." What is wanted is clearly stated, it is heartfelt, there is a simile which is a memory device. As an example of a good incantation after the fact, the play on <i>chando</i> and <i>chanda</i> is useful in fascinating the mind; another trick often helpful is to use rhyme.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="VIRIYA">Viriya</a></b>: Energy, vitality, vigor. We have already seen energy in the <a href="gradualesson7.htm#THE_SEVENTH_LESSON">Seventh Lesson</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Energy begets energy. The reverse is also true, a slack attitude towards what one wishes to accomplish will manifest itself in the thing dragging on forever and likely coming to nothing. Sometimes making something 'work' takes tremendous effort and one needs to be able to walk away from the task when at last put to rest with the idea that one threw into it 100% effort.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="CITTA">Citta</a></b>: Heart. We have already seen <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#SatisfactionwithHeart">Heart</a> in the <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#PartII">MasterpastyourSatisfactionPastures</a> Sutta. Emotion, a mental/emotional effort we usually term: "Put your Heart into it." Nobody can achieve magic power without the will to do it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="VIMAMSA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimamsa.htm">Vimaɱsa</a></b>: vi=2, re; mam &gt; man = mind; mamsa = member (as in the male member, or arm, or leg); sa = one. Pali English Dictionary [PED]: consideration, examination, test, investigation &gt; vimansati: "to try to think" to consider, examine, find out, investigate, test, trace, think over. The lack of connection the obvious "re-member" is, I believe, consequent on the evolution of the idea of thinking, which was, in the beginning, simply remembering things. Today, taking memory for granted, we 'piece together ideas' 'find the missing link'.</p>

					<p class="f4">One of the best examples I have come across demonstrating what is required here is a story Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan tells Carlos [Carlos is speaking; the 'assemblage point' referred to is Don Juan's construction for the mechanism of perception; suffice it to say that this is a matter of memory in that to use the movement he suggests requires lengthy training in shifting perceptions from one 'world' to another]:</p>

						<p class="in1">"He [Don Juan] said that for a seer human beings were either oblong or spherical luminous masses of countless, static, yet vibrant fields of energy, and that only sorcerers were capable of injecting movement into those spheres of static luminosity. In a millisecond they could move their assemblage points to any place in their luminous mass. That movement and the speed with which it was performed entailed an instantaneous shift into the perception of another totally different universe. Or they could move their assemblage points, without stopping, across their entire fields of luminous energy. The force created by such movement was so intense that it instantly consumed their whole luminous mass.</p>

						<p class="in1">He said that if a rockslide were to come crashing down on us at that precise moment, he would be able to cancel the normal effect of an accidental death. By using the speed with which his assemblage point would move, he could make himself change universes or make himself burn from within in a fraction of a second. I, on the other hand, would die a normal death, crushed by the rocks, because my assemblage point lacked the speed to pull me out."</p>

					<p class="f4">The idea is again based on the fact that at a certain point "reality" is simply what we imagine it to be, and what we imagine is what we remember.</p>

					<p class="f4">If we compromise this view a tad to accommodate usual translation and the PED, we could say that 'vimamsa' is 'looking into things' where the things being looked into will always be things remembered. The difference, is the fact that the seer, seeing something in memory is also able to manipulate it, or rather, to manipulate around it, even to the degree of completely transferring his 'being' to another situation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha describes this this way: "As easily as a strong man might bend his outstretched arm or fold back his stretched out arm, he is able to disappear from here and re-appear there."</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="samadhi" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm">Samādhi,</a></b> serenity or high-getting fits into the picture by way of three of it's attributes: calm, insight, and letting go. The single most important aspect in a work of magic power is letting go. A wish can never come to fruition as long as it is still under formation which is another way of saying it is being held on to. And it is from the position of serenity that what one is about is most clearly seen. 'The wishes of the virtuous, beggars, come to fruition because of their clarity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it all together, the point to be emphasized here is that each of the four paths is a compound. However translated they must be made into single, multi-fasceted terms. My translation is saying that the term is describing a type of own-making where the exertion to create experience for the self (own-make <i>saŋkhāra</i>) is connected to 'wish-samadhi' etc. It is 'own-making' that is the mechanism of action. The other terms are modifiers.</p>

					<h4><a id="LengthofLife" href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#fiftyyearsofhumanlife">Length of Life</a></h4>

							<p class="in2">What does "Length of life" mean to a beggar? In the case of this case, if a beggar practices the Four Power Paths: he may if he so desire, live out the remainder of the <a href="#kappa">kappa</a>. This is what "Length of life" means to a beggar.</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="Beingonebecomemany">Being one also become many,<br />
					being many also become one</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The meaning is: Appearing in one way as one individuality,<br />
					also appear in a multiplicity of ways<br />
					as a multiplicity of individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">This practice builds on the first one, of forming a mind made body from this body: from forming one mind-made body from this body, form a multiplicity of mind-made forms from this body.</p>

					<p class="f4">This includes:<br />
					Appearing in more than one place at the same time (polypresence);<br />
					assuming the appearance of real and "imaginary" creatures<br />
					(a snake, a panther, an elephant, a bird, a half human/half animal creature, and so forth);<br />
					assuming the shape of a mountain or a tree<br />
					or an army on the march,<br />
					(that latter including assuming the appearance<br />
					of a collective of individuals).</p>

					<p class="f4">For an example of this last is one story that is told of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/beginners_questions/garland_of_thumbs.htm">Angulimalla</a> (Garland of Thumbs), who was able to single-handedly terrify an entire army by taking on the appearance of standing on the back of an elephant with sword uplifted, backed up by fierce demonic warriors.</p>

					<p class="f4">The greater the power of the individual,<br />
					the greater the number of "forms" he is able to assume<br />
					(both sequentially and simultaneously).</p>

					<p class="f4">Buddhaghosa (Path of Purity, pp 439) would have you discard your original form when assuming a different form. I think this is describing only one of many varieties of ways this power is manifested and the idea should not be 'discard'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a case where one goes from the original personality to another personality in a completely different state. There is, also, the situation where without losing consciousness of any of them one produces multiple bodies and is aware through each as appropriate.</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe Castaneda's Don Juan is describing the first case accurately when he speaks about the individuality of one mental state as being 'irrelevant' when in another. Not 'discarded' but just simply not the subject of awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the second case focus splits and goes from one being to another or multiple others but without completely losing awareness of any of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In any case Buddhaghosa is in error on the one count where we definitely have examples of where what we are told is happening is that a multiple number of secondary individualities has been produced simultaneously with (and sometimes identical to) the original ... all visible together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the second half of this power: from being multiple, becoming one. It is important in the exercise of Psychic Power that one be swiftly able to give up what one has done (i.e., go back to the previous form).</p>

					<p class="f4">This entails being able to distinguish between individual sounds and between the same sound made by different sources and between the same sound made nearby and at a distance, by the same and different sources.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once one has shed the need to identify individuals as always themselves, for example, it is possible to hear coming from one and the same person voices from a variety of sources.  Sounds usually identified with this world are heard as coming from other worlds, and so forth. The reverse of this being the basis for the belief in "possession" and the "madness" of some who "hear voices" and for 'channels' when they are not fakes — they have maintained a continuing sense of identity with the body at the same time their perception is of a different reality. Far and near can mean at a distance in time as well as space and "loka" or station of consciousness. I hear Big drum is the Buddha etc., little drum is such as such as later followers, etc. — things said of greater and less relevance to the goal are heard thundering (as it were) through time. ... or not.</p>

					and from that village<br />

					sat in such a way,<br />
					spoke in such a way,<br />
					became silent in such a way;<br />
					and from that village<br />
					I went back again<br />
					to my own village."</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that this is the ability to see not only one's own past habitations, but also those of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two basic ways of remembering past lives:</p>

					<p class="f4">The first way is through phenomena.<br />
					One sees, or hears, or senses, or understands something (this can happen accidentally or by focusing the mind) and then becomes aware of the experience called Déjà vu "Didn't this happen before?" At that point if the mind can be taken off the doubt, all the past existences that have intersected at this same experience are visible in the memory. With a lot of practice one can take that moment and expand it to explore the whole of one or another of the existences that crossed that point.</p>

					<p class="f4">The other method is to piece together the past in chronological order.<br />
					The practice starts with recollecting present time and working back through the morning to the previous day back to the time of birth to the time of conception, through the previous death, to the previous existence and so forth. The training for this is in the orderly progression suggested in the section called "<a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#activities">Whatever a Beggar does</a>, he does in a Satisfactory fashion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The advantage of the latter method is that a specific time and place can be located and examined, whereas the former route is by chance. The need and ability to use either method depends upon the power of the individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">It must be remembered that some births are extremely difficult to remember because of their nature: some in hell are extraordinarily unsettling to watch, some don't make sense because they lasted millions upon millions of years, others are difficult to separate out from thousands upon thousands of almost exactly similar habitations. Again, animal birth and other lower births are very difficult to recall as the mental processes of those lives are quite different than those of humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">One more point. One of the words used to describe the totally liberated Beggar is '<a id="AKALIKA">AKALIKA</a>' (a = no; ka; li = line; ka; from the practice of the hunter in identifying how close he is to his prey by tracking the trail of scat — "this one is a week old, this one is three days old, this one is from today, after leaving town ...) living outside Time. The awareness of this begins at the first stages of advancement in the system when one has understood intellectually that "this" (body etc) is not the self. That insight frees one from a chronological framework tied to "this" body. This, however, leads to difficulties in identifying the sequences of births, since the more the one insight develops, the less any bodily form is identified as "my previous habitation."</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, this apparently obvious bit of information:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Past is the Past and not the Present or the Future.<br />
					The Future is the Future and not the Past or the Present.<br />
					The Present is the Present and not the Past or the Future.<br />
					<span class="f2"><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p62">— SN 3.22.62</a></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Factoid: The sequence in the Pali is always: Past, Future, Present. The mind is in many ways similar to a web search tool, give it a concept and it will roll on forever gathering information about that concept. One does not want to get stuck by that in dwelling on the past or in planning for the future, so the last instruction in any sequence is usually constructed as the one on which to focus.</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="realms"><b>The Realms of the Imagination, or A Map of the Mind</b></a></p>

					<p class="f4">At one point it was widely believed in the West that Buddhism was atheistic, that Buddhists did not believe in God. This is not the case at all. At it's most fundamental, the Pali holds that the world is the work of the Imagination or Mind, and consequently, in a subjective sense, anything that a being can believe is possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Holding that it is all an illusion, however, does not mean that some illusions are not stronger than others. We hold the "ordinary" world together by our collective illusion. We do not permit certain things to "exist" until "science" has proven they are able to exist. I, personally, have enjoyed immensely watching the evolution of physics in just my lifetime. It has made remarkable strides towards a physics that was accepted by Buddhists 2600 years ago. Not there yet, but <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/non-buddhist/hawking.htm">Stephen Hawking</a>, with his wormholes, is rubbing up against the magical trick of <a href="#Manifestheretransportedbeyond">disappearing from one place and reappearing in another.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddhist Cosmology is essentially that of the pre-Hindu culture into which Gotama was born, with some reorganization and some additions. As Westerners, we should be aware that in all likelihood this is the same set of beliefs in slightly changed form that was the basis of the Greek and Roman Cosmologies.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, in this system, a Creator god, a "Brahma" named <a id="Pajapati" href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/pajapatis_problem.htm">Pajapati</a>. If we allow that we may not know the nature of what is called here an "Angel" and a Demon, or if we think of the lesser Greek and Roman 'gods', much of the Hindu system from Pajapati down could fit seamlessly (well, there might have to be some trimming and tucking) into western beliefs. A greater difference is in the fact that in the Hindu hierarchy there are gods above Pajapati. Essentially we might say that they point to Pajapati and say: "He did it!"</p>

					<p class="f4">There is one more major difference: Many of the Hindu Gods, including Pajapati, reflect a deep underlying belief in the duality of Nature: Pajapati is <a id="TheCreatoroftheCreated">The Creator of the Created</a>, therefore he is also the One Who Brings Death, <a id="Mara">Mara</a>, <a id="TheEvilOne">The Evil One</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe a certain element of this does in fact exist in Christianity in the belief that God created the Devil. The difference is that in the Hindu belief system God does not dissociate himself from his responsibility.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is a very rough delineation of the difference between the Judeo-Christian cosmology and the Hindu Cosmology.</p>

					<p class="f4">The difference between both of these and the Pali is that the Pali holds that while there is no argument about the existence or non-existence of these various sorts of beings and their positions, none of them has overcome death or ending; and all of them are in the same boat in terms of being unable to point to anything there that is the self of them: and all are, as a consequence, subject to rebirth. If it has come into being, it is subject to Time; it has a beginning, a middle, and an End. That goes for Got the Creator as well as for the humble beggar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, then, is the Pali Cosmology, or Map of the Mind. The names of spheres of consciousness where beings tend to be reborn. Again in the Pali system the world is like the imagination, anything is possible, but there are certain predictable tendencies — for example, in the imaginations of nearly all peoples, "bad" peoples are imagined to be reborn in some variation or another of Hell.</p>

Such a deed is the killing of Mother or Father or of an Arahat or Silent Buddha or drawing the blood of a Buddha (it is not possible to murder a SammasamBuddha). The White Lotus hell takes consciousness and breaks it up into hundreds of thousands of separate parts (each being an existence which is living and dying in accordance with the effects of his kamma) and scatters them across the cosmos so that the "individual" is in an endless agony over what, exactly is the Him of Him (of course he is unable to reach the conclusion that none of them are).</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the advantage of being born as Man: Here we suffer both pain and pleasure but neither exclusively. In most of the rebirths in lower realms, the pain is unremitting or the wits are lacking to allow for reflection sufficient to mend one's ways; in most of the realms above, the pleasure is unremitting and does not allow for reflection or motivation sufficient to mend one's ways.

					<p class="f4"><b>Beings that reside with The <a id="GodsofManipulationPARANIMMITAVASAVATTI">Gods of Manipulation (Paranimmitavasavatti)</a>:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Gods with the power to dispense success or failure. (Note: This may appear to be in contradiction to the laws of kamma. What is at work here, as it is, even, in the case of Pajapati and the creation of the world, is that beings are identifying with impersonal processes, they think they have the power, and others think they have the power.)</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Beings that reside in the <a id="ParadiseofMahaBrahma">Paradise of Maha Brahma</a>:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Also comparable to the Christian "heaven" but in the presence of Brahma. Brahma is a being very close in qualities to the Christian "God." There is, however, more than one Brahma, and Brahma is not immortal, although his lifespan is enormous.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Beings that reside in the <a id="AbhassaraRealm" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/abhassara.htm">Abhassara Realm</a>:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">The Ambassadors of the Heart. They live on Friendly vibrations and excitement and traverse space uttering cries of joy. They are Radiant beings; they radiate light. As described above, they differ in outward appearance, but are of one mind. In most cases when the world comes to an end, beings are reborn in this location. Upon the beginning of the Re-evolution of the World, one by one they drop from here, the first being reborn as Maha Brahma, the rest being reborn under him, believing he created them and the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">These beings also feed on Friendly Vibrations and excitement and traverse space uttering cries of joy ... "oh the joy! Oh the joy!" They are luminescent in appearance, of uniform appearance and of one mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one realm (or set of realms) one can be assured one has never previously revisited. These are special abodes where Non-Returners gather in an atmosphere highly conducive to attaining final Nibbāna. Rebirth here is the goal of Chinese Pure Land Buddhists (although I believe they have a different belief as to the nature of these places as inevitably leading the beings there to Nibbāna). Suddhavasa means pure abode or habit. Aviha = ?The Harmless Ones (but see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.125.wood.pts.htm#n5">Woodward, AN 3.125 n.5</a> where 'non-intelligential,' or 'without process of thinking,'); Attappa = ?The Cool Ones, no appetite, they already ate? (Atta Ata Appa?); Sudassa and Sudassi beats me...? Pleasant all round, pure all round?; Akanittha = No youngsters here. Life in these realms always ends in realizing Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4 c">The Devine Eye</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, with your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified Devine Eye, deeper than the sight of men, see beings as they pass away or come to be. See how it is that beings are poor or rich, beautiful or ugly, happy or unhappy, dull or wise according to the consequences of their deeds, thinking: "So these good people, who practiced low deeds of Mind, Word-Thought-and-Speech, and Body, who belittled the good, who held on to low views, and who acted in accordance with their low views found consciousness again, at the breaking up of the elements at death, in an unhappy realm, in a bad rebirth, in the Abyss, in Niriaya Hell. But these good people, who practiced high deeds of Mind, Word-Thought-and-Speech, and body, who did not belittle the good, who took up High View, and who acted in accordance with High View, found consciousness again, at the breaking up of the elements at death in a happy realm, in a good rebirth, in a heavenly realm."</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Same Way, Beggars, as if a man, sitting on the High Terrace of his habitat at the Crossroads were to look down and see two abodes with entries facing opposite each other, and he were to observe beings as they entered a habitat and left it and walked back and forth and crossed over.</p>
