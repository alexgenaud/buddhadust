					<hr />

					<h4><a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a href="highgetnhigh.htm#fourth_burning">The Fourth Knowing</a> is, in effect, the highest point <i>in the World</i> in the Buddhist view.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two stages that follow that are better than this: The Burning known as <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#EndingofPerceptionandSensation">"The Ending of Sensation-Perception"</a> which is the knowing associated with the actual process of letting go of the World, and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nibbana.htm">Nibbāna</a> itself, which is the condition left after the World has been let go completely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certain other conditions are attainable which are certainly extraordinary.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the attainment of skills of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm">"small magic",</a><br />
					attainment of the four immaterial knowings,<br />
					knowledge of former "habitations",<br />
					knowledge of the outcome of deeds,<br />
					and knowledge of the destruction of the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas</i></a> [corruptions] which is attained by the Arahat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As with numerous other end-points in the system, an individual with the requisite vision could go directly from the fourth knowing to utter detachment, complete freedom, living outside time, <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMAUPEKKHA"><i>upekkha,</i></a> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimutti.htm"><i>vimutti,</i></a> <a href="#AKALIKA"><i>akalika.</i></a></p>
					
					<p class="f4">In <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.51.001.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.51.2</a> it is pointed out that whoever neglects the method for attaining magic powers also neglects the way to the end of pain. So while powers like levitating and walking on water need not be attained, one must at least have developed the methods for attaining them: they amount to the same thing as the method for attaining the goal.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Further, knowledge of former habitations, knowledge of the outcome of deeds, and knowledge that the corruptions have ended are things that are aspects of the state of Arahantship. They are part of the deal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Initiated Beggars are not allowed to demonstrate skills in "small magic" to lay persons, nor are they allowed to state or suggest that they are able to use these powers. The polite thing in these matters is, therefore, not to ask. There is no rule against laymen using such powers. Those laymen who are tempted however should reflect on the number of people that have ended up tied to a stake with a fire burning under them because they were just suspected of being capable of such things. Sometimes it is better to just keep your mouth shut.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is considerable scorn heaped upon practitioners of "small magic" by the Buddha. This is based on the fact that it is essentially, from the point of view of someone who sees things as they really are, just trickery — in a world made up of illusions, creating illusions that astound the ignorant because of their unconventionality is seen to almost always originate from a desire for gain. To put the enormous effort it takes to achieve such powers to a use such as this rather than to the elimination of pain is seen as foolish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One should approach the learning of these skills as a matter of understanding the world: learn how to do them to the degree that produces <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panna.htm">penetrating knowledge</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimokkha.htm">release</a> and then let them go.</p>

					<h4><a id="The4PowerPaths" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm">The Four Little Itty-Biddy Power Paths</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Skills in small magic, and knowledge of former habitations and knowledge of the outcome of deeds are all things which are influenced by the position from which they are attained. As a consequence the method in the <i>Pāḷi</i> is to attain these skills from the <a href="highgetnhigh.htm#FourthBurning">Fourth Knowing.</a> This insures that the development of the skill begins from <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMADITTHI">Consummate View</a> and ends in <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMAUPEKKHA">Consummate Detachment</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">With that end in mind, the assumption in the instructions is that the practitioner is familiar with and able to enter and exit the <a href="highgetnhigh.htm">Four Knowings</a> in forward and reverse order more or less at will, and, having entered the Fourth Knowing, has attained the all-round, clean clear through, bright shinny radiance of detachment. At that point the one who would use powers 'bends down' his mind to the task. This is not the same thing as exiting the <i>jhāna's</i> in descending order, it is taking the power of the <i>jhāna</i> and directing it to a goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Readers who are unfamiliar with personal experience in the actual practice of the techniques described in this <a href="thepaliline.htm#TheGradualCourse">Course</a> may look at some of the "instructions" as to how to attain these magic powers and think that they are not instructions at all. This is a trick we have played: Actually, all the "work" that is usually associated with learning magic powers has already been done by those who have mastered the techniques of the Course to this point: the 'work' is the mastery of the Gradual Training. From the Fourth Knowing, it is sufficient to describe what is to be done in precise terms.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/40_kasinas.htm">Using devices</a> such as crystal balls, rodent entrails, magic wands, magic carpets, <a href="../../../backmatter/exercises/earth_kasina.htm">the earth device,</a> the water device, the wind device, and so forth is completely unnecessary, it's all controlled by mind; just do it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what it means when the Buddha speaks of presenting the <i>Dhamma</i> 'stripped of swaddling'. For example: Don Juan describes 'commanding intent' or the spirit [attempting a work of magic power] as only being possible when the sorcerer: <i>"speaks in gestures. And gestures do not mean signs or body movements, but acts of true abandon, acts of largesse, of humor."</i></p>

					<p class="f4">But here, in the Buddha's system, the key is letting go which examination will show is the active ingredient in true abandon, acts of largesse and humor.</p>

					<p class="f4">What follows concisely states the prerequisite skills for Power:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4><a id="TheCATTARIIDDHIPADA">The <i>Cattari Iddhi Pada</i></a></h4>

							<p class="in2">The <i>Pāḷi</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu chanda-samādhi-padhāna-saṅkhāra-samannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>viriya-samādhi-padhāna-saṅkhāra-samannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>cittasamādhi padhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>vīmaṃsā-samādhi-padhāna-saṅkhāra-samannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ bhāveti.</i>|| ||</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.</p>

					<p class="f1">— <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_51_iddhipadasamyutta.htm#p1">SN 5.51.1</a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="SANKHARA" href="gradualesson5.htm#SANKHARA"><i>Sankhārā</i></a></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>San</i> = co, con, one, same, with, together with; <i>khara</i> = make, found. Con-struct, co-found, con-fect, con-join, con-jure, own-make... The meaning is that one makes a world identified as one's own by co-founding it (I + That).<br />
					<i>"Sankhārā</i>" is identification with the intent to create experience for the self by way of thought, word, or deed and it is the identified-with consequence of the action.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Stated in general terms, the <i>kamma</i> rebounding from <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/avijja.htm">blind</a> <i>sankara</i>ming (so to speak) is consciousness (self-consciousness, or consciousness as an individuality).</p>

					<p class="f4">Translators of this term tend to use only one side or the other in their translations, limiting the understanding they convey only to the 'activities' involved or relating only to the 'fabrications' that are the result. The idea that this is 'personalization' is almost completely overlooked.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="CHANDA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/chanda.htm">Chanda</a>:</b> Wish, desire, intent, will &gt; <i>chando:</i> metric recitation, chant, enchant, canto, cantor, incantation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Per Castaneda's Don Juan, 'intent' or the 'spirit' is the bridge between the individual and the cosmic force that makes things happen which he leaves as a mystery — Buddhists understand this to be <i>kamma</i> or in it's personal aspect <i>'sankhārā'</i> — consequently it is a combined force made up of willing or wishing and the verbal skills for forming the wish.</p>

							<p class="in2"><b>The first Incantation:</b></p>

							<p class="in2">There comes a time, Beggars,<br />
							after a long long time,<br />
							when Maha Brahma,<br />
							while contemplating the world,<br />
							thinks to himself:</p>

							<p class="in2">"O, O, O, If only there were light at night,<br />
							in the same way as the sun lights up the day!"</p>

							<p class="in2">And the moon appears. <i>Canda,</i> The Moon. (Incandescent, candle).</p>

					<p class="f4">Today [Friday, March 18, 2005 6:41 AM] (or rather in my father's day) we have the expression 'He moons for her' (today we have the expression "he mooned her", which is something else altogether.)</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an important example of a well made incantation or "wish." What is wanted is clearly stated, it is heartfelt, there is a simile which is a memory device. As an example of a good incantation after the fact, the play on <i>chando</i> and <i>chanda</i> is useful in fascinating the mind; another trick often helpful is to use rhyme.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="VIRIYA">Viriya:</a></b> Energy, vitality, vigor. We have already seen energy in the <a href="gradualesson7.htm#THE_SEVENTH_LESSON">Seventh Lesson</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Energy begets energy. The reverse is also true, a slack attitude towards what one wishes to accomplish will manifest itself in the thing dragging on forever and likely coming to nothing. Sometimes making something 'work' takes tremendous effort and one needs to be able to walk away from the task when at last put to rest with the idea that one threw into it 100% effort.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="CITTA">Citta:</a></b> Heart. We have already seen <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#SatisfactionwithHeart">Heart</a> in the <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#PartII">MasterpastyourSatisfactionPastures</a> Sutta. Emotion, a mental/emotional effort we usually term: "Put your heart into it." Nobody can achieve magic power without the will to do it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="VIMAMSA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimamsa.htm"><i>Vimaɱsa:</i></a></b> <i>vi</i> = 2, re; <i>mam</i> &gt; man = mind; <i>mamsa</i> = member (as in the male member, or arm, or leg); <i>sa</i> = one. <b><i>Pāḷi</i> English Dictionary</b> [PED]: consideration, examination, test, investigation &gt; <i>vimansati:</i> "to try to think" to consider, examine, find out, investigate, test, trace, think over. The lack of connection the obvious "re-member" is, I believe, consequent on the evolution of the idea of thinking, which was, in the beginning, simply remembering things. Today, taking memory for granted, we 'piece together ideas' 'find the missing link'.</p>

					<p class="f4">One of the best examples I have come across demonstrating what is required here is a story Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan tells Carlos [Carlos is speaking; the 'assemblage point' referred to is Don Juan's construction for the mechanism of perception; suffice it to say that this is a matter of memory in that to use the movement he suggests requires lengthy training in shifting perceptions from one 'world' to another]:</p>

						<p class="in1">"He [Don Juan] said that for a seer human beings were either oblong or spherical luminous masses of countless, static, yet vibrant fields of energy, and that only sorcerers were capable of injecting movement into those spheres of static luminosity. In a millisecond they could move their assemblage points to any place in their luminous mass. That movement and the speed with which it was performed entailed an instantaneous shift into the perception of another totally different universe. Or they could move their assemblage points, without stopping, across their entire fields of luminous energy. The force created by such movement was so intense that it instantly consumed their whole luminous mass.</p>

						<p class="in1">He said that if a rockslide were to come crashing down on us at that precise moment, he would be able to cancel the normal effect of an accidental death. By using the speed with which his assemblage point would move, he could make himself change universes or make himself burn from within in a fraction of a second. I, on the other hand, would die a normal death, crushed by the rocks, because my assemblage point lacked the speed to pull me out."</p>

					<p class="f4">The idea is again based on the fact that at a certain point "reality" is simply what we imagine it to be, and what we imagine is what we remember.</p>

					<p class="f4">If we compromise this view a tad to accommodate usual translation and the PED, we could say that <i>'vimamsa'</i> is 'looking into things' where the things being looked into will always be things remembered. The difference, is the fact that the seer, seeing something in memory is also able to manipulate it, or rather, to manipulate around it, even to the degree of completely transferring his 'being' to another situation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha describes this this way: "As easily as a strong man might bend his outstretched arm or fold back his stretched out arm, he is able to disappear from here and re-appear there."</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="samadhi" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm"><i>Samādhi,</i></a></b> serenity or high-getting fits into the picture by way of three of it's attributes: calm, insight, and letting go. The single most important aspect in a work of magic power is letting go. A wish can never come to fruition as long as it is still under formation which is another way of saying it is being held on to. And it is from the position of serenity that what one is about is most clearly seen. <i>'The wishes of the virtuous, beggars, come to fruition because of their clarity.'</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it all together, the point to be emphasized here is that each of the four paths is a compound. However translated they must be made into single, multi-faceted terms. My translation is saying that the term is describing a type of own-making where the exertion to create experience for the self (own-make <i>saṅkhāra</i>) is connected to 'wish-<i>samādhi</i>' etc. It is 'own-making' that is the mechanism of action. The other terms are modifiers.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4><a id="LengthofLife" href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#fiftyyearsofhumanlife">Length of Life</a></h4>

							<p class="in2">What does "Length of life" mean to a beggar? In the case of this case, if a beggar practices the Four Power Paths: he may if he so desire, live out the remainder of the <a href="#kappa"><i>kappa.</i></a> This is what "Length of life" means to a beggar.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4><a id="TheMindMadeBody">The Mind-Made Body</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">With the settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, he bends down his mind to the conjuration of, the making for his own experience of a mind-made body.</p>

					<p class="f4 c">He, from this body, conjures another body, material, mind-made, totally complete of limb, endowed with higher powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as a man pulling a reed from it's sheath would know, "This is the reed, this is the sheath," or,</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as a man pulling a sword from it's scabbard would know, "This is the sword, this is the scabbard," or</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as a snake sluffing off it's slough might know, "This is the slough, this is the snake."</p>

					<p class="f4">With your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of a mind-made body. From this body, conjure another body, material, mind-made, totally complete of limb, endowed with higher powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">For those familiar with Castaneda, this is analogous to the dream body only with the difference being that this is conjured from a deep meditative but awakened state rather than from within a dream.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><i>Exercise:</i></b> Remember the meditation on <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#internal">the double ended skin bag?</a> Ok, then, pick up on that meditation where you left off. This time focus, in stead of on the foulness of the hair, and so forth, on retaining a picture of the thing in your mind. Concentrate. And Picture. Bit by bit, put the thing together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Remember: This body is made up from <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#elements">solids, liquids, heat and motion.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">In which of the <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#postures">postures</a> is this body placed or disposed?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is it doing? Remember: <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#activities">Whatsoever it does</a>, Beggars, let it do it in a Satisfying Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Make it <a href="gradualdana.htm#DANA">generous</a>, endowed with <a href="gradualsila.htm#SILA">ethical culture</a>, <a href="gradualjagarianuyoga.htm#Jagarianuyoga">self discipline,</a> <a href="gradualjagarianuyoga.htm#ContentwithLittle">wanting little</a>; well tamed, well trained, well educated in the <i>Dhamma</i> of the Aristocrats.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, above all, remember that it too will come to an end.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">With your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of a variety of powers.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="Beingonebecomemany">Being one also become many,<br />
					being many also become one</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The meaning is:<br />
					appearing in one way as one individuality,<br />
					also appear in a multiplicity of ways<br />
					as a multiplicity of individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">This practice builds on the first one, of forming a mind made body from this body: from forming one mind-made body from this body, form a multiplicity of mind-made forms from this body.</p>

					<p class="f4">This includes:<br />
					appearing in more than one place at the same time (polypresence);<br />
					assuming the appearance of real and "imaginary" creatures<br />
					(a snake, a panther, an elephant, a bird, a half human/half animal creature, and so forth);<br />
					assuming the shape of a mountain or a tree<br />
					or an army on the march,<br />
					(that latter including assuming the appearance<br />
					of a collective of individuals).</p>

					<p class="f4">For an example of this last is one story that is told of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/beginners_questions/garland_of_thumbs.htm">Angulimalla</a> (Garland of Thumbs), who was able to single-handedly terrify an entire army by taking on the appearance of standing on the back of an elephant with sword uplifted, backed up by fierce demonic warriors.</p>

					<p class="f4">The greater the power of the individual,<br />
					the greater the number of "forms" he is able to assume<br />
					(both sequentially and simultaneously).</p>

					<p class="f4">Buddhaghosa (Path of Purity, pp 439) would have you discard your original form when assuming a different form. I think this is describing only one of many varieties of ways this power is manifested and the idea should not be 'discard'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a case where one goes from the original personality to another personality in a completely different state. There is, also, the situation where without losing consciousness of any of them one produces multiple bodies and is aware through each as appropriate.</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe Castaneda's Don Juan is describing the first case accurately when he speaks about the individuality of one mental state as being 'irrelevant' when in another. Not 'discarded' but just simply not the subject of awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the second case focus splits and goes from one being to another or multiple others but without completely losing awareness of any of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In any case Buddhaghosa is in error on the one count where we definitely have examples of where what we are told is happening is that a multiple number of secondary individualities has been produced simultaneously with (and sometimes identical to) the original ... all visible together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the second half of this power: from being multiple, becoming one. It is important in the exercise of psychic power that one be swiftly able to give up what one has done (i.e., go back to the previous form).</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="Manifestheretransportedbeyond">Manifest here, transported beyond notice</a>, transported through walls, transported through fortifications unsticking, go whithersoever as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">Literal: "Become here, become beyond, beyond walls, beyond fortifications, not stuck he goes just wherever like space.</p>

					<p class="f4">This means, being visible or perceptible through sight or hearing, becoming hidden from perception while one's self able to perceive from a given location, being able to go through walls without getting caught in the middle, essentially to be able to go wherever one wants as if passing through space.</p>

					<p class="f4">This power is relative to the power of the individual <i><b>and</b></i> the observer. The more powerful individual is able to remain unseen by the less powerful; the less powerful individual is visible to the more powerful. Power is relative to detachment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="Jumpintotheearth">Jump into and out of the earth</a> [<i>paṭhavī</i> solid objects] as though in water; go on water without parting it as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="Gothroughspace">Go through space</a> cross legged like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="TouchtheMoonandSun">Touch and feel with the hand the Moon and Sun</a>, as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="TurnupinBrahmaheaven">Turn up in the body even in the Brahma heaven</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/beginners_questions/who_the_potter.htm">The Potter,</a> Beggars,<br />
					or his skillful apprentice,<br />
					could make any shape of pot that he <i>wished</i> to<br />

					clean all round,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					shut off from the stench,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					steadfast,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4><a id="HigherPowers">Higher Powers</a></h4>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="TheDivineEar"><b>The Divine Ear</b></a></p>

					<p class="f4">With your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of The divine Ear.</p>

					<p class="f4 c">With purified godlike hearing, beyond that of ordinary men, <a id="hearbothsounds">hear both sounds:</a> godly and man-made, far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as if a man, traveling along the highway were to hear the sound of a big drum or a little drum or cymbals or little bells, he would be able to say: "That is the sound of a big drum." "That is the sound of a little drum." "That is the sound of cymbals." "That is the sound of little bells."</p>

					<p class="f4">This entails being able to distinguish between individual sounds and between the same sound made by different sources and between the same sound made nearby and at a distance, by the same and different sources.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't look for this 'out there', look for it 'right here'. Once one has shed the need to identify individuals as always themselves, for example, it is possible to hear coming from one and the same person voices from a variety of sources. Sounds usually identified with this world are heard as coming from other worlds, and so forth. The reverse of this being the basis for the belief in "possession" and the "madness" of some who "hear voices" and for 'channels' when they are not fakes — they have maintained a continuing sense of identity with the body at the same time their perception is of a different reality. Far and near can mean at a distance in time as well as space and <i>"loka"</i> or station of consciousness. I hear big drum is the Buddha etc., little drum is such as such as later followers, etc. — things said of greater and less relevance to the goal are heard thundering (as it were) through time. ... or not.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 c"><a id="EncompassingaHeart"><b>Encompassing a Heart with the Heart</b></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Here again is an example of a <i>Dhamma</i> used in one place for one purpose (The <i>Satipaṭṭhana Sutta</i>, to set up <a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#SatisfactionwithHeart">Satisfaction with mental states</a> — remember, the purpose of that is detachment, and that detachment is the basis for clarity) and turning up in another place for another purpose (as the power of reading other's emotions and mental states.) The training of the former is the training for the latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">With your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of mastery of seeing <i>(diṭṭha),</i> hearing <i>(suta),</i> sensing <i>(muta),</i> and knowing <i>(viññāta).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The signs perceived through these faculties are related to but distinct from the signs which provoked the exposition of the best of signs above. The distinction is that here there is no set meaning to any given sign. A sight perceived as a sign through the eye is understood in a manner similar to what we call free-association. The meaning is unique to each case.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="DITTHA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dittha.htm">Diṭṭha:</a></b> PED: 1. Seen; 2. Known, understood; 3. Visible, determined by sight, in connection with <i>Dhamma</i> meaning the visible order of things, the world of sensation, this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the system as a whole, <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm"><i>'diṭṭhi'</i></a> is the hypothetical Consummate View. <i>'Diṭṭha'</i> is seeing that view as it really is. Here, in its function as a category of signs it means knowing through sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning, upon rising up, the eye is "caught" by a color or a shape, and the meaning is "understood."</p>

					<p class="f4">The thing "seen" stands as a symbol of something because of it's shape, or color, position, and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, placing an object, or finishing a task it immediately "looks" as though the "scene" had always been that way, and he knows and sees, to the extent of his ability, events of the past and future possibilities. <i>"Déjà vu,"</i> without the doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="SUTA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/suta.htm"><i>Suta:</i></a></b> PED: 1. Heard; in special sense "received through inspiration or revelation"; learned; taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">A small taste of this is "heard" in the popular expression "I hear ya" when by a gesture or unrelated expression a thing is understood that was not directly said. Artists and writers and religious mystics experience this in times of inspiration. Automatic writing, painting where the painting seems to be coming of its own, sustained periods of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">This also encompasses understanding or intuitive knowledge attained through sounds, as described for <i>Dittha</i> and the Divine Ear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="MUTA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/muta.htm"><i>Muta:</i></a></b> PED: thought, supposed, imagined (i.e. received by other vaguer sense impressions than by sight and hearing).</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing: Knowing and Seeing through the senses of taste, touch and smell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anyone read Proust? where the taste of a Madeleine cookie (like cookie-sized angel-food cake, always shaped like a sea-shell) produced the insight that resulted in <i>Remembrance of Things Past,</i> (In Search of Lost Time, or Times Past)? One of the really great works of fiction in the world. Like that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Very often related to recollection of aspects of past lives, and a door to the future.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="VINNATA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vinnata.htm"><i>Viññāta:</i></a></b> [say: veen nya ta] PED: apperceived, (re)cognized, understood, cogitated, learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing that one knows something (related to, but not exactly the same as <i>Viññāṇā,</i> re-knowing-knowledge, consciousness; knowing awareness), female intuition, directly knowing. <i>Viññāta</i> is the knowing; <i>Viññāṇā</i> is knowing that you know.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, with your settled-down heart pure all round, clean all round, unspotted, shut off from the stench, grown soft and workable, steadfast, unshakably fixed, bend down the mind to the conjuration of the knowledge of former habitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">So <i>aneka-vihitaṃ pubbe-nivāsaṃ anussarati seyyathīdaṃ ekam pi jātim ...</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Aneka:</i> <i>an</i> = not; <i>eka</i> = one; not just one, numberless, many, numerous, countless.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Pubbe:</i> former, earlier, prior.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nivasam:</i> stopping place, dwelling, resting place, abode, living, sheltering &gt; the putting on of, <i>(ni),</i> dress, costume, clothing, vestment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, overviews his witnessing<br />
					of not just one birth,<br />
					but manifold prior habitations this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now one birth,<br />
					now two births,<br />

					now four births,<br />
					now five births,<br />
					now ten births,<br />
					now twenty births,<br />
					now thirty births,<br />
					now forty births,<br />
					now fifty births,<br />
					now one hundred births,<br />
					now a thousand births,<br />

					now a hundred thousand births,<br />
					now many an age in the rolling out of the world,<br />
					now many an age in the rolling back of the world,<br />
					now many a rolling out and rolling back of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that there place such was the name,<br />
					such was the town,<br />
					such was the skin color,<br />
					such was the food,<br />
					such was the pleasure and pain experienced,<br />
					and such was the way life came to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting from that he reappeared there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this place such was the name,<br />
					such was the family,<br />
					such was the color,<br />
					such was the food,<br />
					such was the pleasure and pain experienced,<br />
					and such was way life came to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting from that he reappeared here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with it's characteristics and signs<br />
					he overviews his witnessing<br />
					of not just one birth<br />
					but manifold prior habitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					as if a man were to go<br />
					from his own village<br />
					to another village<br />
					and from that village<br />
					were to go to another village<br />
					and from that village<br />
					were to go back again<br />
					to his own village,<br />
					he might think:<br />
					"I went from my own village<br />
					to another village;<br />
					there I stood in such a way,<br />
					sat in such a way,<br />
					spoke in such a way,<br />
					became silent in such a way;<br />
					from that village<br />
					I went to another village<br />
					and there I stood in such a way,<br />
					sat in such a way,<br />
					spoke in such a way,<br />
					became silent in such a way;<br />
					and from that village<br />
					I went back again<br />
					to my own village."</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that this is the ability to see not only one's own past habitations, but also those of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two basic ways of remembering past lives:</p>

					<p class="f4">The first way is through phenomena. One sees, or hears, or senses, or understands something (this can happen accidentally or by focusing the mind) and then becomes aware of the experience called <i>Déjà vu</i> "Didn't this happen before?" At that point if the mind can be taken off the doubt, all the past existences that have intersected at this same experience are visible in the memory. With a lot of practice one can take that moment and expand it to explore the whole of one or another of the existences that crossed that point.</p>

					<p class="f4">The other method is to piece together the past in chronological order. The practice starts with recollecting present time and working back through the morning to the previous day back to the time of birth to the time of conception, through the previous death, to the previous existence and so forth. The training for this is in the orderly progression suggested in the section called "<a href="thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#activities">Whatever a Beggar does,</a> he does in a Satisfactory fashion. (You can see that if you have not neutralized your past experiences in this life, you will have a difficult, unlikely, impossible time recollecting past lives this way.)</p>

					<p class="f4">The advantage of the latter method is that a specific time and place can be located and examined, whereas the former route is by chance. The need and ability to use either method depends upon the power of the individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">It must be remembered that some births are extremely difficult to remember because of their nature: some in hell are extraordinarily unsettling to watch, some don't make sense because they lasted millions upon millions of years, others are difficult to separate out from thousands upon thousands of almost exactly similar habitations. Again, animal birth and other lower births are very difficult to recall as the mental processes of those lives are quite different than those of humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">One more point. One of the words used to describe the totally liberated Beggar is <a id="AKALIKA"><i>'akalika'</i></a> (<i>a</i> = no; <i>ka;</i> <i>li</i> = line; <i>ka;</i> from the practice of the hunter in identifying how close he is to his prey by tracking the trail of scat — "this one is a week old, this one is three days old, this one is from today, after leaving town ...) living outside Time. The awareness of this begins at the first stages of advancement in the system when one has understood intellectually that "this" (body etc) is not the self. That insight frees one from a chronological framework tied to "this" body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, this apparently obvious bit of information:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Past is the Past and not the Present or the Future.<br />
					The Future is the Future and not the Past or the Present.<br />
					The Present is the Present and not the Past or the Future.<br />
					<span class="f1"><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p62">— SN 3.22.62</a></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Factoid: The sequence in the <i>Pāḷi</i> is always: Past, Future, Present. The mind is in many ways similar to a web search tool, give it a concept and it will roll on forever gathering information about that concept. One does not want to get stuck by that in dwelling on the past or in planning for the future, so the last instruction in any sequence is usually constructed as the one on which to focus.</p>

This is, again, a study which is intended to be all encompassing. Directing the attention to these categories as places would ignore the fact that beings are born in other places than those suggested here if they are seen only as locations. As categories of types of being, their precise location is not important. (Anuruddha, for example, speaks of himself and his companions as: "... we have divers bodies, but assuredly only one mind" <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.031.horn.pts.htm#fn8">MN 31, Horner;</a> #2 just below.)</p>

					<p class="f4 c ctr"><a id="realms"><b>The Realms of the Imagination,<br />
					or<br />
					A Map of the Mind</b></a></p>

					<p class="f4">At one point it was widely believed in the West that Buddhism was atheistic, that Buddhists did not believe in God. This is not the case at all. At it's most fundamental, the <i>Pāḷi</i> holds that the world is the work of the imagination or mind, and consequently, in a subjective sense, anything that a being can believe is possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Holding that it is all an illusion, however, does not mean that some illusions are not stronger than others. We hold the "ordinary" world together by our collective illusion. We do not permit certain things to "exist" until "science" has proven they are able to exist. I, personally, have enjoyed immensely watching the evolution of physics in just my lifetime. It has made remarkable strides towards a physics that was accepted by Buddhists 2600 years ago. Not there yet, but <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/non-buddhist/hawking.htm">Stephen Hawking,</a> with his wormholes, was rubbing up against the magical trick of <a href="#Manifestheretransportedbeyond">disappearing from one place and reappearing in another.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddhist cosmology is essentially that of the pre-Hindu culture into which Gotama was born, with some reorganization and some additions. As Westerners, we should be aware that in all likelihood this is the same set of beliefs in slightly changed form that was the basis of the Greek and Roman cosmologies.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, in this system, a creator god, a "Brahma" named <a id="Pajapati" href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/pajapatis_problem.htm">Pajapati.</a> If we allow that we may not know the nature of what is called here an angel and a demon, or if we think of the lesser Greek and Roman gods, much of the Hindu system from Pajapati down could fit seamlessly (well, there might have to be some trimming and tucking) into western beliefs. A greater difference is in the fact that in the Hindu hierarchy there are gods above Pajapati. Essentially we might say that they point to Pajapati and say: "He did it!"</p>

					<p class="f4">There is one more major difference: Many of the Hindu gods, including Pajapati, reflect a deep underlying belief in the duality of Nature: Pajapati is <a id="TheCreatoroftheCreated">"The Creator of the Created,"</a> therefore he is also "The One Who Brings Death," <a id="Mara">"Mara,"</a> <a id="TheEvilOne">"The Evil One."</a></p>

					<p class="f4">I believe a certain element of this does in fact exist in Christianity in the belief that God created the Devil. The difference is that in the Hindu belief system God does not dissociate himself from his responsibility.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is a very rough delineation of the difference between the Judeo-Christian cosmology and the Hindu Cosmology.</p>

					<p class="f4">The difference between both of these and the <i>Pāḷi</i> is that the <i>Pāḷi</i> holds that while there is no argument about the existence or non-existence of these various sorts of beings and their positions, none of them has overcome death or ending; and all of them are in the same boat in terms of being unable to point to anything there that is the self of them: and all are, as a consequence, subject to rebirth. If it has come into being, it is subject to Time; it has a beginning, a middle, and an End. That goes for God the Creator as well as for the humble beggar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, then, is the <i>Pāḷi</i> cosmology, or map of the mind. The names of spheres of consciousness where beings tend to be reborn. Again in the <i>Pāḷi</i> system the world is like the imagination, anything is possible, but there are certain predictable tendencies — for example, in the imaginations of nearly all peoples, "bad" persons are  reborn in some variation or another of Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are thousands of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/subdivisions_hell.htm">varieties of Hell</a> in this system. Birth in none of them is permanent. Some deeds are so powerfully "bad" that they result in birth in what is called <a id="TheWhiteLotusHell">The White Lotus Hell,</a> which lasts as long as an evolution and devolution of the world — a <i>"kappa":</i> a <i>kappa</i> is made up of countless aeons; a simile for the length of an aeon is: imagine a huge cart full of sesame seeds, and once every hundred years a man were to come along and remove one of them; well the cart would be empty before the aeon was over; or, imagine Mount Everest, and once every hundred years a man were to come along and rub it with a cloth; well, Mount Everest would be warn away more quickly than an aeon — which is long enough for most people, but even beings born there are not irredeemable. Such a deed is the killing of Mother or Father or of an Arahat or Silent Buddha or drawing the blood of a Buddha (it is not possible to murder a <i>SammāsamBuddha</i>). The White Lotus hell takes consciousness and breaks it up into hundreds of thousands of separate parts (each being an existence which is living and dying in accordance with the effects of his <i>kamma</i>) and scatters them across the cosmos so that the "individual" is in an endless agony over what, exactly is the Him of Him (of course he is unable to reach the conclusion that none of them are).</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Beings that reside in <a id="Animal">animal</a> bodies.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">I am constantly amazed, when, during discussions of <a id="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> (a non Buddhist concept in which the soul or true self hops from incarnation to incarnation — the <i>Pāḷi</i> concept being likened to what occurs when one match lights another, it is not the same flame, but the one depends on the other and both depend on conditions, there being no "one thing" there that is the "flame of flame") people say "When I am reborn, I want to be such and such an animal."</p>

					<p class="f4">You can look at animals that lead even the most luxurious of lives ... pet cats and dogs and horses ... and if you see what you are seeing you can see the misery! How would you like to eat with your face? Never be able to wipe your ass after you take a dump? Walk around naked. Eat tasteless garbage food? Most likely have your reproductive organs removed? And those are the ones living in luxury. Life in the wild is an unbroken spell of fear of being eaten.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beings of unskillful mental deeds, deeds of word-thought and speech, and deeds of body, who once enjoyed delicious tastes here, beggars, are reborn as grass eaters, dung eaters, scrap-heap eaters, beings that prey on each other or on the weak and helpless."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the advantage of being born as Man: Here we suffer both pain and pleasure but neither exclusively. In most of the rebirths in lower realms, the pain is unremitting or the wits are lacking to allow for reflection sufficient to mend one's ways; in most of the realms above, the pleasure is unremitting and does not allow for reflection or motivation sufficient to mend one's ways. Just here is there sufficient opportunity and motivation for reflection on the various states of existence and the wits to work your way out of all this <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#DUKKHA"><i>dukkha.</i></a></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the simile describing the rarity of birth as a man:</p>

					<p class="f4">As often as that sea turtle<br />

					pokes his head up<br />

But these good people, who practiced high deeds of mind, word-thought-and-speech, and body, who did not belittle the good, who took up Consummate View, and who acted in accordance with Consummate View, found consciousness again, at the breaking up of the elements at death in a happy realm, in a good rebirth, in a heavenly realm."</p>
