					<p class="f4">What seven concepts, when used to see things to their root with penetrating knowledge, and to understand them in their broadest limits, such that their disgusting nature is seen as it really is and one has released them in their entirety, can bring one to the uttermost freedom of detachment?</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is mind is rooted in solitude, in calm, in <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nirodha.htm">ending</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nekkhamma.htm">letting go</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The setting up of mind is accomplished by careful observation of the origins, sustenance and ending of phenomena organized into four broad categories: what happens with body, the nature of sensation, the states of the heart (mental states, states of mind), and the cultivation and understanding of ideas which organize the mind, otherwise known as 'The <i>Dhamma</i>'. Observation should be to the point where one has become completely detached, free of any wanting or disappointment, liking or disliking.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f5 c"><b>2.</b> </span><a id="Dhamma-VICAYA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma_vicaya.htm"><i>Dhamma-Vicaya:</i></a> Dhamma research, investigation, study.</p>

					<p class="f4">This includes coming into the presence of a teacher, listening, remembering, <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vitakka.htm">thinking about</a>, testing, and evaluation of the results of testing.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is Dhamma investigation is rooted in solitude, in calm, in ending and letting go.</p>

						<div class="inbdr wpc80">
							<p>This is investigation of the <i>Dhamma</i> among other things to determine what is and what is not <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm"><i>Dhamma</i></a>.</p>

							<p>In making the determination of what is and what is not <i>Dhamma</i> there are two basics:</p>

							<p>First, we are instructed to determine what is <i>Dhamma</i> by comparing <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm">sutta</a> to sutta. This means that within the <i>Sutta Pitaka (Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya,</i> and <i>Samyutta Nikaya),</i> if you have found something that you believe is inconsistent, that issue should be put to one side, reserving judgment until the matter becomes clear to you, the rest is <i>Dhamma.</i> If you are judging some doctrine outside the <i>Sutta Pitaka</i> to doctrine within the <i>Sutta Pitaka</i> and you find a disagreement you should make the assumption that the doctrine as stated within the <i>Sutta Pitaka</i> is <i>Dhamma</i> and the doctrine in apparent contradiction is not <i>Dhamma.</i> Later experience may change one's judgment.</p>

							<p>Second, one must test in actual practice.</p>

							<p>One must gain <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nana.htm">"book learning" knowledge</a> of the system; understand the instructions. This, for those of us using English, is a very difficult task in itself in that to be scrupulous, we need to learn at least the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossologytoc.htm">important <i>Pāḷi</i> words</a> and relate them to our English vocabulary.</p>

							<p>In this there is no more important dictum than the saying:</p>

									<p class="in2"><b>"In the same way that the sea,<br />
									in all ways and throughout<br />
									tastes of salt,<br />
									the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
									in all ways and throughout<br />
									tastes of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimutti.htm"><i>vimutti,</i></a> Freedom.</b></p>

							<p>Next we must think about what must be done to put the knowledge into practice.</p>

							<p>Then we must examine the consequences (did good conditions — conditions relative to the goal, that is: things that reduce lust, being, and blindness — increase and bad conditions decrease?).</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f5 c"><b>3.</b> </span><a id="VIRIYA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/viriya.htm"><i>Viriya</i></a>: The science of energy-building. (&gt; virility, vigor)</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is energy-building is rooted in solitude, in calm, in ending and letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/four_foods.htm">food</a> that nourishes the dimension of self-awakening that is energy-building so as to cause it to arise if not present in the here and now, or to cause it to increase if present in the here and now?</p>

					<p class="f2">See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_46_bojjhangasamyutta.htm#p51">SN 5.46.51</a> <i>Ahara Sutta</i> for these descriptions of the various foods for the Dimensions of Awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is putting forth <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vayama.htm">effort, exertion, striving</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">To gain or increase energy, exert energy. Try it.</p>

					<p class="f4">One of the classic ways of stimulating energy is to think about death. Conjure any thoughts and images you have of death and then reflect that your body too is made in such a way that it has not escaped death, will end in death. Again, reflect on the fleeting nature of time and about how little of it one really has to get properly prepared for death. If you think you know all about it and have no concern, you need to know that you are fooling yourself ... unless, of course, you are an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f5 c"><b>4.</b> </span><a id="PITI" href="#Enthusiasm"><i>Piti</i></a>: The science of creating excitement, passion, enthusiasm.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/piti.htm">enthusiasm,</a> is rooted in solitude, in calm, in ending and letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Pīti</i> is a broad general category that includes a spectrum of emotional states from mild interest to rapture. Initially it involves an act of will, a deliberate cultivation of interest and putting energy into the appreciation of what one is doing. Self-motivation. It needs to get just a little beyond the idea that this study is work. Think 'challenge.' Think 'taking on the most difficult challenge life offers.' Think, "Meeting the challenge!" Then get beyond your own accomplishments and develop an appreciation of the system and how it has been constructed, what it took to make it into what it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Part of the practice of the Seven Dimensions of Awakening, is the development of skill in balancing the energized state with the calm state. Here there are two dangers: under-excitement leading to discouragement and over-excitement leading to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Coming upon some insight or notable progress enthusiasm arises, sometimes in a great surge. At this time one should make a strong effort to keep one's cool, discourage pride and delight and recognize that what one has accomplished is in fact marvelous relative to the world, but likely only a very small step in the system. Making too much of it could lead into some very stupid mistakes and stupid mistakes are very dangerous the further into this field one gets. Discourage your inclination to think that what you have learned is something the whole world needs to know right now and that it is your destiny to make the world believe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The other dangerous reaction to a serge of energetic enthusiasm is old habit. For the most part people have used their energies in destructive habits such as the pursuit of sense pleasures. If this is the direction of your inclination, attempt to anticipate yourself and see how this amounts to a useless waste of your effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">With practice you will come to be able to anticipate your reaction to progress and temper enthusiasm with calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">A good, practical way to smooth out a wild burst of energetic enthusiasm is to pace your <a href="../../../backmatter/exercises/the_place_to_pace.htm">place-to-pace</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up ahead you will learn that <i>pīti</i> is eliminated at the point where one enters the third <i>jhāna</i> burning or knowing state of serenity, but do not let this knowledge deter you from cultivating this important tool. Life, even for the Arahant, is mostly lead below the second burning. To that point an energetic calm smooth strong enthusiasm informed by knowledge and tempered by humility is nothing but an asset.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f5 c"><b>5.</b> </span><a id="PASSADDHI" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/passaddhi.htm"><i>Passaddhi:</i></a> Impassivity. <i>passa</i> = seeing; <i>addhi</i> = beyond, over, above. The cultivation of impassivity, indifference, poise, being above it all.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is impassivity is rooted in solitude, in calm, in ending and letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Impassivity is first developed through deliberate self-control in the face of some strong impulse to react, later it becomes second nature. Think of the poker player or the martial arts practitioner. Every reaction, no matter how slight, that is useless or not directly lined up with one's purpose is a waste of time, weakens one's position and reveals it to the enemy. And there are enemies! What Awakening is about is battle. You should make no mistake about that. This world does not like to lose it's suckers. Every false move, every wasted move will be taken advantage of and used to corrupt your progress. And you will find the most dangerous enemy is within. Over time bad habits have taken up residence and have become identified as 'my nature'. They need to be evicted, and the way they are evicted is by not giving them the food they need, their residence, which is your participation with them in their self-indulgence through reaction. Non-reaction, the development of impassivity, will initially scour off that internal enemy and later keep him at a distance.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f5 c"><b>6.</b> </span><a id="SAMADHI" href="highgetnhigh.htm#PartIII"><i>Samadhi:</i></a> The science of serenity or getting high.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is serenity is rooted in solitude, in calm, in ending and letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is food for the arising of the dimension of awakening that is serenity [<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm"><i>samadhi</i></a>] which has not yet arisen, or for the cultivation and fulfillment thereof, if already arisen?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, things whose signatures, signs, and indications point to their calming effects, things that do not cause confusion. Studious etiological examination of such, — [<a id="YONISOMANISIKARA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/yoniso-manasikara.htm"><i>yoni-somani-sikara</i></a> down to the womb = <i>yoni</i>] — is this food for the arising of serenity which has not yet arisen, or for the cultivation and fulfillment thereof, if already arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Samādhi,</i> serenity, getting high, is defined in this system in two ways:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first case it is having so cultivated detachment from lust, the desire to be, and blindness that one lives in a state free of any worldly ambitions, leaves no sign of lust, desire to be or blindness, and is in a state empty of lust, desire to be or blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second case is the seventh dimension of the <i>Magga, Sammā Samādhi,</i> High Serenity, or the highest way to cultivate serenity with the objective of ending pain:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Letting go of involvements with the world,<br />
					live in the appreciation of the peace and calm of solitude;<br />
					letting go of thinking in verbal terms,<br />
					live in the appreciation of serenity;<br />
					letting go of enthusiasm,<br />
					live at ease;<br />
					letting go of living at ease,<br />
					live detached.</p>

					<p class="f4">The single most important thing to notice about the science of developing serenity it that it is a matter of letting go, not acquisition.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second you notice that there is anxiety to get connected with this practice you should understand that you are going the wrong direction and stop and regroup.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>A note of caution:</b> Some translators and some schools have translated the term <i>samādhi</i> as 'concentration'. This, in spite of the fact that a thoughtful reading of the instructions for the <i>jhānas</i> clearly indicate the role of concentration as <i>only</i> supportive and even in this case the idea is not 'concentration' so much as 'focus' — getting the whole picture clear and aimed at one goal. Concentrating on concentration as the only aspect of this practice can lead one off on wild tangents, the more dangerous in that some of those tangents, such as the development of magic powers and very deep and interesting insights into worldly things make mistaking this practice for the correct method very easy. Counterbalance excessive concentration by first noting whether or not it is accompanied by any sort of ambition. If it is, turn your 'focus' onto <i>Dhamma</i> Research. The <i>Dhamma</i> as we have it is larger than your scope if you have anything remaining of attachment to this world and <i>Dhamma</i> Research will sooner or later make you aware of that.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f5 c"><b>7.</b> </span><a id="UPEKKHA" href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upekkha.htm"><i>Upekkha:</i></a> The science of Objective Detachment</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of self-awakening that is objective detachment is rooted in solitude, in calm, in ending and letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is a system of developing objective detachment with regard to every conceivable thing, which is the goal, one might ask is it possible that we are being asked to see this system itself as "repellant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is, in fact the case in a manner of speaking. We do need to remember that the idea of 'repellence' is not a statement as much about the object as about an attitude towards it. One is repelled by it because it is an aspect of a world which is the source of pain. If we hang onto it beyond the point of it's usefulness simply because it is a beautifully constructed work, we are still involved in the world of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">The well-tamed, well-trained, well-educated student of the Aristocrats, taking this system as his vehicle, practices it to perfection and then lets it too, go [see <a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#TheSimileoftheRaft">The Simile of the Raft</a>].</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes this is a paradox. Paradoxi are good for your mind. What you do is use desire to attain the goal through use of the <i>Dhamma</i> until you have reached the goal at which time you let go of the desire and any holding on to the <i>Dhamma.</i> This is not one day you are A. Bungling Jerk, Ph.D. and the next day, snap fingers, just like magic, you are an Arahant. You need to take steps. To take steps you need desire and direction. So you need to use the tools at hand, like a practitioner of judo or aikido, taking the forces that would work against you and using their power on themselves.</p>

					the enthusiasm that comes from enjoying solitude."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when he had spoken,<br />
					Old Man Sariputta said to the Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, Bhagava!<br />
					Marvelous, Bhagava!<br />
					How well said<br />
					is that which was said by the Bhagava:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Train yourself this way, householder:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let us, occasionally experience the enthusiasm<br />
					that comes from enjoying solitude.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, Bhagava, the student of the Aristocrats<br />
					gains and holds on to the enthusiasm<br />
					that comes from enjoying solitude,<br />
					five things cannot reach him:</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time,<br />
					the pain and misery<br />
					that come from lust<br />
					cannot reach him</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time,<br />
					the pleasure and gladness<br />
					that come from lust<br />
					cannot reach him</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time,<br />
					the pain and misery<br />
					that come from low works<br />
					cannot reach him</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time,<br />
					the pleasure and gladness<br />
					that come from low works<br />
					cannot reach him</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time,<br />
					the pain and misery<br />
					that come from good deeds<br />
					cannot reach him."</p>

					<p class="f4">And Gotama said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Well said Sariputta!"<br />
					and repeated all that he just said.</p>
