					<h4><a id="GuardingtheSenses">Guarding the Senses</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">These are the senses:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Sight<br />
					Hearing<br />
					Smell<br />
					Taste<br />
					Touch<br />
					Knowing</b></p>

					<p class="f4">These are what are called<br />
					the Doors to the Senses:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>The Eye<br />
					The Ear<br />
					The Nose<br />
					The Tongue<br />
					The Body<br />
					The Mind</b></p>

					<p class="f4">The experience of sense awareness arises as a consequence of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact is the simultaneous presence of sense organ with it's appropriate stimulus and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">A <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/rupa.htm">visual object</a> comes within the scope of the eye, and the result is <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vedana.htm">sensation</a> associated with the sight (experienced as pleasant, unpleasant, or not-unpleasant-but-not pleasant); <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanna.htm">perception</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vinnana.htm">consciousness.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">A previous act of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankhara.htm">identification</a> with the activities that started the process [intent to create personal experience coupled to deeds of body, speech and mind] puts a sort of 'mark of ownership' on the consequences and it is identifying (claiming, recognizing) these markers that results in the experience known as "My sight", or "I am seeing."</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx250">
							<p>The experience of sensation — that is, the subjective reaction to or evaluation of the unpleasant or pleasant (physical, verbal or mental) — changes in accodance with whether or not the individual is oriented to gain in the experience of worldly pleasures or to attaining an end to kamma. For example the experience of pleasant sensation arising from kamma to be experienced as worldly pleasure can be changed to the perception of the unpleasant implications of that situation for one seeking to end kamma. Thus the pleasant can be experienced as pleasant or unpleasant, the unpleasant can be experienced as unpleasant or pleasant, or both can be experienced indifferently.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">Arising from this experience comes <i>liking</i> or <i>disliking</i> depending on the sensation and whether or not one's original intent was to create worldly experience or to escape the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both liking and disliking, are, in the Pali, forms of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/chanda.htm">wanting</a> and lead to action that repeats the cycle and results in an outcome determined by kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this reason, the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/using_beggar_4_bhikkhu.htm">beggar</a> trains himself to be wary of sights, sounds, scents, flavors, touches, and thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being aware of the danger,<br />
					he guards "The Doors of the Senses"<br />
					and when an object of sense<br />
					comes into the range<br />
					of an organ of sense,<br />
					he neither dwells on its general appearance<br />
					nor it's details.<br />
					— He is aware of it, but does not 'think about' it<br />
					or dwell on the sensation associated with it<br />
					or take delight in it<br />
					or react to it's influence<br />
					or say to himself 'sensing, sensing, sensing'.</p>

					<h4><a id="ModerateEating">Moderate Eating</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">Here the practice of the time called "The <a id="OneMealMan">OneMealMan</a> Practice", will be described in order to provide an idea of how the modern practitioner might modify his own eating habits in order to further his Dhamma progress:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx250 marl6">
							<p>Noon means 12 noon.</p>

							<p>Simple:</p>

							<p>12:00 AM = Day begins;<br />
							12:00 PM = Night begins.</p>

							<p>Refrain from eating at Night, at a wrong time = refrain from eating past 12:00 High Noon. Previously I (and others) have suggested a 'noon hour' (12:00 to 1:00), or 'two-finger-shadow of an upright stick, but this does not fit the uses such as suggested by the statement of the disadvantages of giving to the gods 'after the sun is full up'. [see e.g.: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.112.horn.pts.htm">MN 112;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.228.hare.pts.htm#fn1">AN 5.228</a>]</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">In this case<br />
					a beggar eats one meal a day,<br />
					after sunup,<br />
					before noon.</p>

						<div class="floatlpp wpx250 mart6">
							<p>For a sutta dealing with the introduction of this practtice, resistance to it, and Gotama's justification of it, see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p70">MN 70.</a></p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">The original practice consisted of two styles, called "Hard Man" and "Soft Man".</p>

					<p class="f4">Hard Man practice<br />
					was the practice of eating<br />
					at one sitting<br />
					from the contents of one bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meal is done,<br />
					no matter how much was eaten,<br />
					if the beggar rose up from eating<br />
					(hand-out bowl clean —<br />
					we would say "gets up from the table").</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Soft Man Practice<br />
					(which was the practice adopted by Gotama),<br />
					a beggar could eat several bowls-full<br />
					at several sittings<br />
					and even take one bowl-full<br />
					back to his residence<br />
					for eating later,<br />
					provided all eating was completed<br />
					before noon.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha's usual actual practice,<br />
					we can gather from his own statements<br />
					and descriptions found in the Pali,<br />
					was to eat one bowl full at one sitting.<br />
					Occasionally he would take additional food,<br />
					which is why he would be described as practicing<br />
					"Soft Man Style".</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time he pointed out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not because I am austere<br />
					in my eating practices<br />
					that those who follow me<br />
					respect me as they do,<br />
					for there are those<br />
					whose practices are far more austere than mine,<br />
					it is because I teach a higher Dhamma<br />
					that they respect me as they do."</p>

					<p class="f4">Modifications were made to both practices at the request of laymen wishing to make good kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">These were that a beggar of either style could, if he had such, drink a beverage and eat a piece of bread or pastry upon rising up before going on his begging rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">All beggars ate whatever they wished that was allowable that was placed in the bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">There was, at one time, a huge dispute over what was and what was not proper to eat.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dispute was begun by the infamous Buddhist bad guy, <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/devadatta.htm">Devadatta,</a> who tried to institute the practice of not eating flesh. (He wanted to prove himself more austere than Gotama).</p>

					<p class="f4">The dispute threatened to disrupt the Order, and so Gotama laid out the rules of what was proper to "accept" in a formula he called <a id="the_3s">"The Threes:"</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Flesh was acceptable if</p>

					<p class="f4">It was not</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">1. Seen<br />
					2. Heard<br />
					3. Suspected</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">To have been<br />
					1. killed by one's self<br />
					2. requested to have been killed by one's self<br />
					3. killed specifically for him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i><b>An individual could be a vegetarian if he wished,</b></i><br />
					but there was no bad kamma<br />
					(and no rule)<br />
					associated with eating something<br />
					"killed on speculation"<br />
					by a butcher or hunter<br />
					or found dead, etc.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/manosancetana.htm">intent</a> that is the important thing,<br />
					and in such a case<br />
					there is no intent<br />
					(that is, by the beggar,<br />
					or by another for that specific beggar<br />
					that that beggar is aware of).</p>

					<p class="f4">It is possible to adopt the One-Meal-Man practice and be quite fat and happy,<br />
					but one should approach this sort of diet with good sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a reasonable period of adjustment of a few weeks during which there will be for some a fair to middling battle with desire for food.</p>

					<p class="f4">(and this desire may re-surface from time-to-time usually in association with other unrelated changes)</p>

					<p class="f4">A six month or so period follows during which there is considerable weight loss<br />
					(especially for people who are overweight)<br />
					and during this time one should be careful not to exceed one's limits.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a practice that was intended to provide adequate sustenance to a beggar whose desire to bring kamma to an end had already caused him to become a homeless wanderer, willing to die if necessary, to achieve his goals.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was not designed for a modern family man working long hours or doing manual labor or who was under a great deal of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">After a period of adjustment the body will return to a normal healthy weight and the energy level will be high and there will be a substantial improvement in one's feelings of well being.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point it is possible to work long hours, do manual labor and keep up with the strongest of them or work under great stress without problems.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is during the period of adjustment that caution should be taken.</p>

					<p class="f4">One meal or many meals,<br />
					all are advised to eat moderately,</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Not for the pleasure of taste<br />
					Not out of habit<br />
					Not to fill time<br />
					Not for good looks<br />
					Not for show of wealth,<br />
					But only just sufficient to keep the body going a little further on <span class="c">This Way</span>, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"By this moderate eating practice<br />
					I will bring old kamma to conclusion<br />
					and set going no new kamma,<br />
					and I will have sufficient sustenance,<br />
					while living blamelessly."</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Some of the benefits of moderate eating are:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx250">
							<p>There are few things that are as swift in the furtherance of the attainment of magic powers and clarity of view than a little hunger! It re-awakens the hunter in one.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">One wants little<br />
					In times of scarcity one is prepared<br />
					The body is healthy: One has few illnesses and recovers from illnesses quickly<br />
					One's time is not wasted in slavery to the belly<br />
					The mind is clear and alert<br />
					One is of little trouble to one's supporters.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of those wishing to adjust their own habits of wakefulness, here is the Pali ideal:</p>

						<div class="floatlpp wpx300 mart6">
							<p>The ideal, when asleep, is to remain wide-awake — clearly conscious. If dreaming, watch the dreams with an awareness of separateness. This is approximately 100% the opposite of what is taught by Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan, where the objective is 'being in dreaming'. Don Juan's idea is to create a 'dreaming body' — a dream-like and fluid identified-with self-conscious self-controlled body that acts in the dream state. Here the approach is to separate from any identified-with state.</p>

							<p>The Buddha was said to have slept only rarely, on occasions when he was ill,<br />
							or when he was very old, during the hottest part of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the day, pace back and forth and sit, clearing the mind of distracting mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the first watch of the night, pace back and forth and sit, clearing the mind of distracting mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the <i>majjhima</i> (middle/magic) watch of the night, lie down in the lion posture (on the right side, with the head supported by the right arm, and with the legs one on top of the other so that one foot is over the other — bone on bone!) and, clearly conscious and wide awake, focus the mind on the time of rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the last watch, after rising up, pace back and forth and sit, clearing the mind of distracting mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will undertake and practice those qualities that make one a contemplative,<br />

'Hunger' and 'Overeating' are not in the Pali and are not the problems. That <i>'Iti,'</i> 'Thus' points the way. The emphasis needs to be on the lack of desire connected with the eating, not on the destruction of the feeling of hunger. One slaps back the arising sensations by not indulging in their pleasantness (as tastes, means for beautification, for show of wealth ...) thus providing no platform for new desires for more or different foods as one eats and it is by that and not by not overeating that the arising of new sensations is prevented.</p>
