							<p>NOTE: : We suffer greatly here in written English as a consequence of our excessively prudish, hypocritical society. The Four Truths use the Words 'Dukkha' (the meaning of which is obvious to any child) and Tanha, where other words were possible choices, for the reason that they relate, like a metaphor, to every day activities and as such are very easy to remember and provide a constant reminder (or instruction) of the truth of the statement being made: Everything is ka-kha (Take a look folks, everything, even ideas, is waste product in a recycled state); K-kha comes from Eating and Drinking, or, originally, from Hunger and Thirst. If you want to bring k-kha to an end, stop Eating and Drinking. That is the way to do it.</p>
