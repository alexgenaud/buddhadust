					<p class="f4"><i>Cattāri Nāma Kim?</i> What is Four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What four concepts, when used to see things to their root with penetrating knowledge, and to understand them in their broadest limits, such that their disgusting nature is seen as it really is and one has released them in their entirety, can bring one to the uttermost freedom of detachment?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<div class="inbdr wpc94">
							<p class="in1">There are three acceptable answers to this question:<br />
							The Quartered Aristocratic Truth; [The 4 Aristocrats of Truths, the Four Noble Truths]<br />
							The <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_satipatthana.htm">Four Satipaṭṭhānas;</a><br />

							The first of these is being used here as it is most satisfying in terms of the design of this course.</p>

							<p>NOTE: : We suffer greatly here in written English as a consequence of our excessively prudish, hypocritical society. The Four Truths use the Words <i>'Dukkha'</i> (the meaning of which is obvious to any child) and <i>Taṇha,</i> where other words were possible choices, for the reason that they relate, like a metaphor, to everyday activities and as such are very easy to remember and provide a constant reminder (or instruction) of the truth of the statement being made: Everything is ka-kha (Take a look folks, everything, even ideas, is waste product in a recycled state); K-kha comes from eating and drinking, or, originally, from hunger and thirst. If you want to bring k-kha to an end, stop eating and drinking. That is the way to do it.</p>
