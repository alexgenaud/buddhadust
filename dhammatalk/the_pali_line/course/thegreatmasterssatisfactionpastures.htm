<meta name="description" content="DN 22: Dīgha Nikāya Sutta 22: Mahā Sati-Paṭṭhāna Suttantaɱ, Michael M. Olds' translation: The Setting Up of Mindfulness. The long version of the famous sutta in which the Buddha describes the setting up of the mind by way of understanding the origin, sustainance and ending of body, sense experience, mental states and the Dhamma. Possibly the most famous, certainly one of the most important of all the Buddhas Suttas. It is this sutta which is the basis for the wide-spread 'mindfulness' business which makes use of but the first of its instructions." />

					<h4><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The reader should refer back to lessons <a href="gradualesson7.htm">Seven</a> and <a href="gradualesson8.htm">Eight</a> to note the position and function of <i>"Sati"</i> in both.</p>

					<p>In lesson Seven, <i>Sati</i> is the overseeing concept, serving the function of reminding the practitioner to create a balance between the energy building side (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma_vicaya.htm"><i>Dhamma-Vicaya,</i></a> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/viriya.htm"><i>Viriya,</i></a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/piti.htm"><i>Pīti</i></a>) and the calming down side (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/passaddhi.htm">Passaddhi</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm">Samadhi</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upekkha.htm">Upekkha</a>).</p>

					<p>The usual simile is that it is like tuning a lute, it does not play properly if over-strung or if under-strung.</p>

					<p>In lesson Eight, High Mind (<a href="gradualesson8.htm#sati"><i>Samma Sati</i></a>) is the state of the mind which has been trained in the various exercises contained in the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i> to prepare it for Consummate Serenity.</p>

					<p>Many people make this Sutta their exclusive Buddhist practice, and it is an excellent choice for that purpose. It has all the most powerful tools of the <i>Dhamma.</i> It should be remembered in this context, that <i>'paṭṭhāna'</i> means 'setting up'. Setting up is not the same thing as the thing that is set up. The term used in the Seven Dimensions of Awakening and in The Eight Dimensional Way is <i>'Sati',</i> the thing that is set up, not the practice. These two are frequently mistaken for each other.</p>

					<p>One more thing: After much thought, this version of the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i> is complete, including the refrains, which occur after each section in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> (and which contain the real meaning of the whole sutta) and the long repetitions found in the description of the Way. This will be a challenging read for many people because of the repetition. Skip if you must. But come back at a later time and think about it.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><i>[4.8.3]</i></span> And then separated<br />

					the Aristocrats describe as:<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2"><i>[4.8.4]</i></span> And then letting go of pain<br />

						<p class="f4 in1">Or he lives observing Dhamma<br />

						or he lives observing Dhamma<br />
						through the aging of things,<br />
						or he lives observing Dhamma<br />
						through the origins and aging of things.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">Or thinking:<br />
						'This is Dhamma'<br />
						he sets up mind<br />
						just enough to get a measure of knowledge,<br />
						a measure of recollectedness.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">Thus he lives observing<br />
