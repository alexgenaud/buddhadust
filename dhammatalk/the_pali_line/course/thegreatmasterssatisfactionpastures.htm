					<h4><a id="introduction">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The reader should refer back to lessons <a href="gradualesson7.htm">Seven</a> and <a href="gradualesson8.htm">Eight</a> to note the position and function of "Sati" in both.</p>

					<p>In lesson Seven, Sati is the overseeing concept, serving the function of reminding the practitioner to create a balance between the energy building side (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma_vicaya.htm">Dhamma-Vicaya,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/viriya.htm">Viriya,</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/piti.htm">Piti</a>) and the calming down side (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/passaddhi.htm">Passaddhi</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm">Samadhi</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upekkha.htm">Upekkha</a>).</p>

					<p class="f4">The usual simile is that it is like tuning a lute, it does not play properly if over-strung or if under-strung.</p>

					<p>In lesson Eight, High Memory (<a href="gradualesson8.htm#sati">Samma Sati</a>) is the state of the memory which has been trained in the various exercises contained in the Satipatthana Sutta to prepare it for High Serenity.</p>

					<p>Many people make this Sutta their exclusive Buddhist practice, and it is an excellent choice for that purpose. It has all the most powerful tools of the Dhamma. It should be remembered in this context, that 'patthana' means 'setting up'. Setting up is not the same thing as the thing that is set up. The term used in the Seven Dimensions of Awakening and in The Eight Dimensional Way is 'Sati', the thing that is set up, not the practice. These two are mistaken for each other by nearly all other translators.</p>

					<p>One more thing: In this version of the Satipatthana the refrains, which occur after each section in the Pali, have been cut to those essential for grasping the meaning through reading.</p>

					<h1>The Spell of Four Great Satisfactions</h1>

					<p class="f4"><a id="nidana">I H<span class="f2"><b>EAR</b></span> T<span class="f2"><b>ELL:</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava Kurusuland came-a revisiting<br />
					their market town, Kammassadhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was while there that The Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!" he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">'BrokeTooth!' say the beggars in response to The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava says this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">One sure thing, this, Beggars,<br />
					a way for the purification of beings,<br />
					for rising above worldly ambitions and disappointments,<br />
					for the subsidence of pain and misery,<br />
					for mastering the method,<br />
					experiencing Nibbāna<br />
					— that is to say, the four settings-up of memory.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, a beggar<br />
					<img src="../../../resources/images/sign_1.5.gif" width="19" height="36" alt="sign #1" /> — lives observing body through the body, ardent, self-aware, recollected, having risen above worldly ambitions and disappointments;<br />
					<img src="../../../resources/images/sign_2.5.gif" width="23" height="36" alt="sign #2" /> — lives observing sense experience through the sense experiences, ardent, self-aware, recollected, having risen above worldly ambitions and disappointments;<br />
					<img src="../../../resources/images/sign_3.5.gif" width="25" height="36" alt="sign #3" /> — lives observing the heart through the heart, ardent, self-aware, recollected, having risen above worldly ambitions and disappointments;<br />
					<img src="../../../resources/images/sign_1.5.gif" width="19" height="36" alt="sign #1" /><img src="../../../resources/images/sign_3.5.gif" width="25" height="36" alt="sign #3" /> — lives observing phenomena through the Dhamma, ardent, self-aware, recollected, having risen above worldly ambitions and disappointments.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr"><a id="body"><img src="../../../resources/images/sign_1.5.gif" width="19" height="36" alt="sign #1" /></a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, does a beggar observe the body, through the body?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="aspiration">Here</a> beggars, a beggar, having gotten himself off to the forest or to the root of some tree, or to some empty hut, and having taken up his seat there sitting down, body upright, legs bent-across-lapwise, mind at the area of the mouth, just so recollects inspiration, just so recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="breathing"></a>If he inspires deeply, he knows: 'I am inspiring deeply.'<br />
					If he expires deeply, he knows: 'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires shallowly, he knows: 'I am inspiring shallowly.'<br />
					If he expires shallowly, he knows: 'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on all bodily experience, I will inspire,' this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Reflecting on all bodily experience, I will expire,' this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying bodily own-making, I will inspire,' this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Pacifying bodily own-making, I will expire,' this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as the spinner, beggars, or his apprentice,<br />
					in pulling long knows: 'I am pulling long'<br />
					in pulling short knows: 'I am pulling short.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, beggars, a beggar<br />
					if he inspires deeply, knows: 'I am inspiring deeply.'<br />
					if he expires deeply, knows: 'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires shallowly, he knows: 'I am inspiring shallowly.'<br />
					If he expires shallowly, he knows: 'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on all bodily experience, I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Reflecting on all bodily experience, I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying the own-body, I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Pacifying the own-body, I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he observes body through body with regard to internals,<br />
					or he observes body through body with regard to externals<br />
					or he observes body through body with regard to internals and externals.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">or he observes body through the origins of things,<br />
					or he observes body through the aging of things,<br />
					or he observes body through the origins and aging of things.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Or thinking: 'This is body'<br />
					he sets up memory just enough to get a measure of knowledge,<br />
					a measure of recollectedness.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he observes but does not grasp after things of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Even so, beggars, a beggar revisits body through body.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="postures"></a>Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
					a beggar, having got going, knows: 'I have gotten going,'<br />
					standing, knows: 'I am standing,'<br />
					sitting, knows: 'I am sitting,'<br />
					lying down, knows: 'I am lying down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, in suchwise as he manages the body,<br />
					thus is such as he knows it to be.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="activities"></a>Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
					a beggar, departing or returning does it with cognizance;<br />
					looking at or looking the other way, he does it with cognizance;<br />
					stretching or flexing, he does it with cognizance;<br />
					wearing cloak, bowl and upper-robe he does it with cognizance;<br />
					eating, drinking, biting, or tasting he does it with cognizance;<br />
					passing matter or passing water he does it with cognizance;<br />
					On the go, standing, sitting, asleep or awake, speaking or becoming silent he does it with cognizance.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="internal"></a>Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
					a beggar, reflects on this body encased by skin<br />
					as filled from the top of the tips of the hairs of the head above<br />
					to the bottom of the soles of the feet below<br />
					with diverse sorts of putrid filth, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is in this body hair of the head, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, meat, sinews, bones, marrow, esophagus, lungs, heart, pancreas, stomach, liver, kidneys, large intestine, small intestines, spleen, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, tears, fat, spit, snot, urine, feces and brain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					as with a double-mouthed sample-bag<br />
					filled with various sorts of grain, suchas:<br />
					fine rice, unhusked rice, kidney beans, white beans, sesame, husked rice,<br />
					and a man there with eyes in his head that can see,<br />
					could see, when he dumped out that bag:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here is fine rice, unhusked rice, kidney beans, white beans, sesame, husked rice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, beggars, a beggar reflects on this body encased by skin<br />
					as filled from the top of the tips of the hairs of the head above<br />
					to the bottom of the soles of the feel below<br />
					with diverse sorts of putrid filth, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is in this body hair of the head, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, meat, sinews, bones, marrow, esophagus, lungs, heart, pancreas, stomach, liver, kidneys, large intestine, small intestines, spleen, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, tears, fat, spit, snot, urine, feces and brain.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="data"></a>Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
					a beggar, reviews this same body,<br />
					however it stands, whatever it is doing, in terms of the data:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is, in this body, earth data, water data, fire data and wind data.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					as the cattle-butcher or the cattle-butchers apprentise<br />
					having butchered a cow,<br />
					arranges the parts at the <i>crossroads</i> as he sits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, beggars, a beggar reviews this same body,<br />
					however it stands, whatever it is doing, in terms of the data:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is, in this body, earth data, water data, fire data and wind data.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The beggar, a seeker, friend Sariputta, should spit out the four settings-up of memory once he has trod their path.</p>
