					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sila.htm"><i>Sīla:</i></a> <i>sī</i> = to seed; <i>la</i> = etcetera. "As ye sow, so shall ye reap." Ethical Culture.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Buddha's system, ethical culture is dictated by self-interest, not some authority, and not by the selfish interests of the greedy, ambitious, blind, and fearful. 'Self-interest' means 'one's best interests according to a point of view', but that, at least, allows for objective evaluation of one's behavior. Here the 'point of view' is Consummate Point of View, <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi — </i> essentially the idea that all existing things bring about pain to the degree one is attached to them. The orientation is to the attachment of the individual, not on the form of the behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">While good deeds produce <i>kamma</i> the consequences of which are experienced as pleasant, for the Buddhist, the highest ethical behavior produces <i>kamma</i> the consequences of which are found in the ending of <i>kamma</i> and are experienced as neither painful nor pleasant. In the Pāli, <i>sila,</i> or ethical behavior, is always the abstention from an act that would produce bad (painful) <i>kamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since the stimulus for an act of bad <i>kamma</i> is always <a href="gradualesson3.htm">sensation</a>, and as sensation is the result of previous <i>kamma</i>, the non-reaction to sensation, provided it is done with the conscious intent to end past <i>kamma,</i> is the bringing to an end of that chain of <i>kamma</i> with no further <i>kamma</i> resulting.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the <i>Pāḷi</i>, there is no bad <i>kamma</i> from deeds of omission, no matter how compelling, or no matter how much the culture of the times might dictate the opposite. Think about it! If intentional 'doing' (aka <i>kamma</i>) were required, the goal of ending <i>kamma</i> could not be attained.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4>Three modes of action, three intents, three outcomes.</h4>

					<p class="f4">Acts are produced by an individual through three modes:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Imagining</b>, or mental wishing or willing, or intending.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Word-thought-and-speech</b> (first you mutter to yourself, and then, we shudder to think of it, you speak).</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Bodily acts</b> (unbend bent arm, bend unbent arm)</p>

					<p class="f4">The <b>intent</b> behind the act determines the pleasant,<br />
					painful,<br />
					or not-painful-but-not-pleasant outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">One intends to produce pleasant sensations,<br />
					or painful sensations,<br />
					or to end <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">According to the intent the consequence is experienced as painful,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					or neither painful nor pleasant.</p>
					
					      <p class="f2 in2">— <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p136">MN 136</a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="in2"><b>Example:</b> If one serves a beggar a meal, with the intention of furthering that beggar's life [intent to produce pleasure], but in some way that meal has become poisoned through no intent of the giver, there is no bad <i>kamma</i> as a consequence.</p>

							<p class="in2">If one feels remorse and guilt as a consequence of some action intended to produce pleasure going wrong, that is in itself bad <i>kamma.</i> [Since there is no bad <i>kamma</i> in connection with this act, the individual feeling remorse has invented the remorse with the intent to create unpleasant sensation]. An incorrect 'view' is the source of on-going misjudgments of this sort and is therefore itself considered bad <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="in2"><b>Example:</b> There is a story of a Japanese torture used on American prisoners of war that is attributed to the Japanese Buddhist culture. In this torture, an innocent person is brought before the prisoner and tortured if the prisoner refuses to cooperate. Here the prisoner would be advised that the torture was not Buddhism, and that the torturers were the only ones who would experience bad <i>kamma</i> as a consequence of their behavior. This is extremely difficult to grasp for the modern American practitioner: there is not only no bad <i>kamma</i> from abstaining from cooperation, but cooperating would, itself be bad <i>kamma</i> in that it would encourage the further use of the torture, and would have been based on incorrect perception of the real mechanism of <i>kamma,</i> something called contrary view, which is bad mental <i>kamma.</i> Finally, the innocent victim of the torture would not, as a consequence of the torture experience bad <i>kamma,</i> but, if the prisoner had cooperated and the victim had been grateful, the view from which that gratitude emanated would be bad <i>kamma,</i> so that the prisoner's cooperation would have had precisely the opposite of the intended result.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first steps in the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm"><i>Ariya Aṭṭhangika Magga</i></a> (<a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#TheMagga">The Aristocratic Multidimensional Way</a>) after <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">Consummate View</a> are brief presentations of ethical culture, and in some ways the entire system of the <i>Pāḷi</i> can be seen as a system of higher ethical culture.</p>

					<div class="floatr wpx475">

						<p class="f2">If you came to the Buddha's Dhamma for a good reason, you came looking for freedom and likely that took the form of seeking freedom from the ten million rules imposed on you by your parents, siblings, schools, clicks, peers, bullies, criminals, courtship, customs, librarians, psychiatrists, doctors, dentists and dietitians, yoga masters, martial arts masters, views of normalcy, copyright laws, political correctness, religions, philosophies and the state with it's 'law-makers' and 40,000 new laws every year. Unlike laws, imposed from the outside, rules in this system are adopted by the practitioner after he sees for himself their value in the attainment of his goals.</p>

						<p class="f2">An act intending to cause harm returns to the actor as a painful consequence. A rule suggesting that that form of behavior be avoided results in freedom from pain. That is the logic.</p>

						<p class="f2">The idea: 'intending to cause harm' is based on an evolving perception. It becomes more sophisticated as one becomes more sophisticated. Abstaining from pursuit of pleasure is imposed on the self by the self to the degree pursuing pleasure is perceived as ending in pain.</p>

						<p class="f2">The rules for the members of the Order are more rigid than those imposed 'in general' by the system for various reasons relating to the maintenance of the order and should not be confused with the process of adopting ethical behavior by the lay beginner.</p>

						<p class="f2">See: Dhammatalk Forum: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/ethical_culture/ec_003.kamma.ethics.morality.htm">Understanding the Distinctions between Kamma, Ethics, Morality, the Rules of the Saṅgha, and the Behavior Required of One Seeking Awakening</a> for a more comprehensive discussion of this issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Buddhist <i>Saṅgha,</i> (the Order of Buddhist Beggars), there are more than 200 <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/vp/01.pat/vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#ThePatimokkha">rules of conduct.</a> However, one time a <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/using_beggar_4_bhikkhu.htm">Beggar</a> came to the Buddha and said that he was unable to remember so many rules and consequently feared falling off the path. The Buddha asked him if he thought he could remember 3 rules. He said he could. <span class="f1">[<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p83">AN 3.83,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.1/jat.1.056.chlm.pts.htm">Jataka #56</a>]</span> So for the purposes of introducing ethical culture at this stage, while not discouraging the newcomer with excessive rules, the three rules will do for now:</p>

						<p class="f4 c in1"><span class="f2"><b>[1]</b></span> <b>Train yourself to abstain from intentional harm to living creatures.</b></p>

						<p class="f4 c in1"><span class="f2"><b>[2]</b></span> <b>Train yourself to abstain from intentionally saying that which is not true.</b></p>

						<p class="f4 c in1"><span class="f2"><b>[3]</b></span> <b>Train yourself to abstain from intentionally taking things that have not been given to you.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">In your intent-connected imaginings, word thought and speech, and bodily acts.</p>

					<p class="f4">However this applies: Abstain from imagining theft or harm, uttering malevolent curses, theft by way of causing people to give by "signifying" with the body, and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rest assured that these three rules are so worded as to encompass all the rules.</p>

						<p class="f2">This is not to be understood as a command. It is given as a matter of advice in interpreting how the law of <i>kamma</i> would apply to one's occupation.

					<p class="f4">It's like some Beggar looking to get seed oil from a seed press and he heaps oil seed into such a press and he cranks that old press</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">round and round and round and round</p>

					<p class="f4">until it oozes out seed oil muchas any Beggar'd wish.</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Cause this is <span class="c">The Way</span> to get seed oil from a seed press, that's how come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Say: <span class="c">"O, O, O May all beings know objective detachment!"</span></p>

					<p>Something to consider:</p>

					<p class="f1">From: [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p38">MN 38</a>] Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/mn/mn.038.ntbb.wp.htm">The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving</a> Wisdom Publications, Bhikkhu Nanamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans.</p>

					<p class="f2"><b>Bhikkhus, the conception of an embryo in a womb takes place through the union of three things. [Here the things that do not result in an embryo are given.] . . . when there is the union of the mother and father, and it is the mother's season, and the being to be reborn is present, through the union of these three things the conception of an embryo in a womb takes place.</b></p>

					<p class="f2">Thus, from the Buddhist point of view, "life" as an individual here in this world begins at conception.<br />
					Also, from the Buddhist point of view, there is no cause in that for bombing abortion clinics or holding anyone in contempt for anything.<br />
					An abortion from this perspective is a serious act of bad <i>kamma</i> for the individual performing it or instigating its performance.<br />
					It's nobody else's business.</p>
