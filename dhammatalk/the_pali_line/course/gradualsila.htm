					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sila.htm"><i>Sīla</i>:</a> <i>sī</i> = to seed; la = etcetera. "As ye sow, so shall ye reap." Ethical Culture.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Buddha's system, ethical culture is dictated by self-interest, not some authority, and not the selfish interests of the greedy, ambitious, blind, and fearful. Of course 'Self-interest' means 'one's best interests according to a point of view', but that, at least allows for objective evaluation of one's behavior. Here the 'point of view' is, naturally, High Point of View, <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi — </i> essentially the idea that all existing things bring about pain to the degree one is attached to them. The orientation is to the attachment of the individual, not on the form of the behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">While good deeds produce kamma the consequences of which are experienced as pleasant, for the Buddhist, the highest ethical behavior produces kamma the consequences of which are experienced as neither pleasant nor unpleasant. In the <i>Pāli</i>, sila, or ethical behavior, is always the abstention from an act that would produce bad kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since the stimulus for an act of bad kamma is always <a href="gradualesson3.htm">sensation</a>, and as sensation is the result of previous kamma, the non-reaction to sensation, provided it is done with the conscious intent to end past kamma, is the bringing to an end of that chain of kamma with no further kamma resulting.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Pali, there is no bad kamma from deeds of omission, no matter how compelling, or no matter how much the culture of the times might dictate the opposite. Think about it! If intentional 'doing' (aka kamma) were required, the goal of ending kamma could not be attained.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4>Three modes of action, three intents, three outcomes.</h4>

					<p class="f4">Acts are produced by an individual through three modes:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Imagining</b>, or mental wishing or willing, or intending.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Word-thought-and-speech</b> (first you mutter to yourself, and then, we shudder to think of it, you speak).</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>Bodily acts</b> (unbend bent arm, bend unbent arm)</p>

					<p class="f4">The <b>intent</b> behind the act determines the pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					or not-pleasant-but-not-unpleasant outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">One Intends to produce pleasant sensations,<br />
					or unpleasant sensations,<br />
					or to end kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">According to the intent the consequence is experienced as pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					or neither pleansant nor unpleasant.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="in2"><b>Example:</b> If one serves a beggar a meal, with the intention of furthering that beggar's life [intent to produce pleasure], but in some way that meal has become poisoned through no intent of the giver, there is no bad kamma as a consequence.</p>

							<p class="in2">If one feels remorse and guilt as a consequence of some action intended to produce pleasure going wrong, that is in itself bad kamma. [Since there is no bad kamma in connection with this act, the individual feeling remorse has invented the remorse with the intent to create unpleasant sensation]. An incorrect 'view' is the source of on-going misjudgments of this sort and is therefore itself considered bad kamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="in2"><b>Example:</b> There is a story of a Japanese torture used on American prisoners of war that is attributed to the Japanese Buddhist culture. In this torture, an innocent person is brought before the prisoner and tortured if the prisoner refuses to cooperate. Here the prisoner would be advised that the torture was not Buddhism, and that the torturers were the only ones who would experience bad kamma as a consequence of their behavior. This is extremely difficult to grasp for the modern American practitioner: there is not only no bad kamma from abstaining from cooperation, but cooperating would, itself be bad kamma in that it would encourage the further use of the torture, and would have been based on incorrect perception of the real mechanism of kamma, something called contrary view, which is bad mental kamma. Finally, the innocent victim of the torture would not, as a consequence of the torture experience bad kamma, but, if the prisoner had cooperated and the victim had been grateful, the view from which that gratitude emanated would be bad kamma, so that the prisoner's cooperation would have had precisely the opposite of the intended result.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first steps in the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm"><i>Ariya Aṭṭhangika Magga</i></a> (<a href="the10thquestion_2.htm#TheMagga">The Aristocratic Multidimensional Way</a>) after <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">High View</a> are brief presentations of ethical culture, and in some ways the entire system of the Pali can be seen as a system of higher ethical culture.</p>

					<div class="floatrpp wpx475">

						<p>If you came to the Buddha's Dhamma for a good reason, you came looking for freedom and likely that took the form of seeking freedom from the ten million rules imposed on you by your parents, siblings, schools, clicks, peers, bullies, criminals, courtship, customs, librarians, psychiatrists, doctors, dentists and dietitions, yoga masters, Martial Arts masters, views of normalcy, copright laws, political correctness, religions, philosophies and the state with it's 'law-makers' and 40,000 new laws every year. Unlike laws, imposed from the outside, rules in this system are adopted by the practitioner after he sees for himself their value in the attainment of his goals.</p>

						<p>An act intending to cause harm returns to the actor as a painful consequence. A rule suggesting that that form of behavior be avoided results in freedom from pain. That is the logic.</p>

						<p>The idea: 'intending to cause harm' is based on an evolving perception. It becomes more sophisticated as one becomes more sophisticated. Abstaining from pursuit of pleasure is imposed on the self by the self to the degree it is perceived as ending in pain.</p>

						<p>The rules for the members of the Order are more ridgid than those imposed 'in general' by the system for various reasons relating to the maintenance of the order and should not be confused with the process of adopting ethical behavior by the lay beginner.</p>

						<p>See: Dhammatalk Forum: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/ethical_culture/ec_003.kamma.ethics.morality.htm">Understanding the Distinctions between Kamma, Ethics, Morality, the Rules of the Saŋgha, and the Behavior Required of One Seeking Awakening</a> for a more comprehensive discussion of this issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Buddhist <i>Saŋgha</i>, (the Order of Buddhist Beggars), there are more than 200 <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/vp/01.pat/vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#ThePatimokkha">rules of conduct</a>. However, one time a <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/using_beggar_4_bhikkhu.htm">Beggar</a> came to the Buddha and said that he was unable to remember so many rules and consequently feared falling off the path. The Buddha asked him if he thought he could remember 3 rules. He said he could. <span class="f2">[<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p83">AN 3.83,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.1/jat.1.056.chlm.pts.htm">Jataka #56</a>]</span> So for the purposes of introducing ethical culture at this stage, while not discouraging the newcomer with excessive rules, the three rules will do for now:</p>

						<p class="f4 c in1"><b>1. Train yourself to abstain from intentional harm to living creatures</b></p>

						<p class="f4 c in1"><b>2. Train yourself to abstain from intentionally saying that which is not true</b></p>

						<p class="f4 c in1"><b>3. Train yourself to abstain from intentionally taking things that have not been given to you.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">In your imaginings, word thought and speech, and bodily acts.</p>

					<p class="f4">However this applies: Abstain from imagining theft or harm, uttering malevolent curses, theft by way of causing people to give by "signifying" with the body, and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rest assured that these three rules are so worded as to encompass all the rules.</p>

						<p>This is not to be understood as a command. It is given as a matter of advice in interpreting how the law of kamma would apply to one's occupation. And no one should use this list as a gauge for judging others. The Buddha had good relations with kings and generals while at the same time holding that it was rare for such a one not to end up in Hell as a consequence of his occupation.</p>

					<h5><a id="Abortion">Abortion</a></h5>

					<p>Something to consider:</p>

					<p>From: [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p38">MN 38</a>] Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta, The Middle Length Discourses, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/mn/mn.038.ntbb.wp.htm">The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving</a> Wisdom Publications, Bikkhu Nanamoli and Bhikkhu Bodi, trans.</p>

					<p><b>Bhikkhus, the conception of an embryo in a womb takes place through the union of three things. [Here the things that do not result in an embryo are given.] . . . when there is the union of the mother and father, and it is the mother's season, and the being to be reborn is present, through the union of these three things the conception of an embryo in a womb takes place.</b></p>

					<p>Thus, from the Buddhist point of view, "life" as an individual here in this world begins at conception.<br />
					Also, from the Buddhist point of view, there is no cause in that for bombing abortion clinics or holding anyone in contempt for anything.<br />
					An abortion from this perspective is a serious act of bad kamma for the individual performing it or instigating its performance.<br />
					It's nobody else's business.</p>
