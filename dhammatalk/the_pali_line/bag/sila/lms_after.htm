               This is a very good example of how the Buddha constructs his instructions. Once the idea that what is being spoken of as good and bad conditions is the buddhist idea based on detachment and the ending of desire, the wording is seen to be such that it is interpreted by each individual according to his development. This is how the expression one encounters throughout the suttas, "This Dhamma is helpful in the beginning, helpful in the middle, and helpful at the end," is to be heard.</p>
