					<p><a id="pp_explains"><img src="../../../../resources/images/pp_explains.gif" width="45" height="52" alt="pp explains pali"></a>This means "However it applies." In other words: No violent or injurous fantasies, no imagining theft, thinking up lies or curses, no covetous or threatening speech, no deceitful signifying with the body, etc.<br />
               This can (and should) get very subtle. You want to write a movie script about a bank robbery. While there might be no bad kamma associated with a story that demonstrated the unethical side of robbing banks, sitting imagining how you would rob a bank in an interesting way for such a script would be imagining theft.<br />
               The most important aspect of the deed is the intent. A passing thought -- a thought that "comes to you," is not an act of mind or imagination; putting will, or intent, or desire into, or cultivation of the thought becomes an act of mind.<br />
               <br />
               Beggars! In a being of Contrary Views, whatsoever deed of body is done in accordance with such views; whatsoever deed of word-thought-and-speech is done in accordance with such views; whatsoever deed of mind is done in accordance with such views; whatsoever intentions, whatsoever thirst, whatsoever calling up, whatsoever Confounding, all such things just conduce to the laying low, the unharmonious, the disheartening, the useless, to the Painful.<br />
               How come?<br />
               Because of Bad Views, Beggars, that's how come.<br />
               In the same way as when a nimb seed or creeper seed or bitter-pumpkin seed is implanted in moist earth, whatsoever nourishment it extracts from earth or water, all such just conduce to making it bitter, making it acrid and unsavory. How come?<br />
               Because of the Bad Seed, Beggars, that's how come<br />
