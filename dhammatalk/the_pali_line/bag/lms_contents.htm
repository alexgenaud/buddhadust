				<p><img src="../../../resources/images/pp_explains.gif" width="45" height="52" alt="PP Explains" />This sutta should be read from start to finish without skipping around! It is modeled after The Gradual Course of instructions introducing people to Gotama's teachings that was used by Ä€nanda and others at the time. It presents the optimal sequence of priorities in the system. Each step builds on the one that came before and it is necessary to have developed skills in each step for proper development of the next. Reading straight through will embed an image of the system which will serve as an invaluable guide throughout one's life. None of these skills are mastered and then forgoten about! They are all necessary and useful throughout one's development as an Awakener.<br />
				<b>Hint:</b> If you find yourself bored and tempted to skip, stop at that point and come back later. This is a sign that there is something there which is important for you to give some deeper thought.</p>
