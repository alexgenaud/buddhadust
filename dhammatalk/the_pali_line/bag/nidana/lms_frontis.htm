            <p><a id="pp_explains"><img src="../../../../resources/images/pp_explains.gif" width="45" height="52" alt="pp explains pali"></a> PaLi: Pa's, Past, Pass; Li: line, sign, lignum, tongue [Dictionary so to speak]. Pali is both the lingo and the line of patter of Old Time Wizzards (who often assume the appearance and mode of livilihood of Beggars, Madmen and Vagabonds in order to pass through this world unnoticed). It uses a vocabulary consisting of a set of root concepts based on onomatopoea [sounds that sound like or trigger the thought of the intended meaning]. It is a sort of DNA of language. A child raised hearing no language would eventually develop Pali. It transcends Time, culture and state of mind and can be understood by any intelligent person older than 15 (older than 15 because much of it's vocabulary depends on understanding sexual events).</p>
