					<h4 class="ctr">On the Two-sided Nature<br />
					of<br />
					The Five Diversions,<br />
					and<br />
					The Seven Dimensions of Awakening</h4>

					<p class="f4">The Five Diversions Become Ten</p>

					<p class="f4">Lust <i>(Kāma-c-chanda)</i> (desire for things relating to the senses, sensual lust): Is called internal when it is one's own lust for the most beautiful lass in the land, or for money, or power, or fame, etc. It is called external when it is the lust of others for things sexual, the mates of others, for money, or power, or fame, etc. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Deviance (<i>Vyāpāda</i>) (anger, malevolence, ill-will) (going by what is not the path): Is called internal when it is one's own deviance, the result of contact with experience of unpleasant things. It is called external when it is the deviance of others. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Laziness and inertia (<i>Thīna-Middha</i>) (fatigue, laziness, inertia, sloth, torpor, drowsiness, boredom): One side is the tiredness and immobility that is the result of well-directed (but mindlessly managed) expenditure of energy, the other side is willful laziness. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doubt and Wavering (<i>Uddhacca-Kukkucca</i>) (excitement, flurry, restlessness, anxiety, remorse): One side is the doubt that arises in connection with doubtful matters. The other side is the wavering that results from that doubt. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vacillation (<i>Vicikicchā</i>) (doubt, wavering, uncertainty): One side is the vacillation that results from uncertainty concerning the internal (is there a self, is there no self, what is one's state after death, etc.). The other side is the vacillation that results from uncertainty concerning the external (is there <i>kamma,</i> results from good and bad deeds, mother and father, wise individuals who have reached the goal and teach it to others). In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Seven Dimensions of Awakening Becomes Fourteen</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind (<i>Sati</i>) (mindfulness, awareness, recollection): On the one side is minding the internal (this body is made up from the four basic ingredients (earth, water, fire, wind), is in this posture (standing still, walking, sitting, lying down), is filled with various sorts of filth, is of the same nature as a body thrown out into the charnel ground). On the other hand is minding the external (other people are made of the four basic ingredients, are found in the four postures, are filled with various sorts of filth, are of the same nature as bodies thrown out into the charnel ground). In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Investigation of things (<i>Dhamma-Vicaya</i>) (norm, Dhamma, dhamma, investigation, searching, scrutinizing, discriminating) On the one side is inwardly-directed examination. On the other side is externally-directed examination. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Energy (<i>Viriya</i>)(persistence (Bhikkhu Thanissaro) meaning stick-toitiveness, keeping your nose to the grindstone): On the one side is energy developed for and used for the training of the body. On the other side is the energy developed for and used for training the mind. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enthusiasm (<i>Pīti</i>) (appreciation, liking, zest, rapture): On the one side is whatever enthusiasm is the result of contact with thinking and pondering (especially of the advantages of solitude, but here all sorts of things that inspire enthusiasm that result from thinking and pondering). On the other side is whatever enthusiasm is the result of being without contact with thinking and pondering (especially the awareness that word-thought and construction of ponderous thoughts are not necessary). In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Impassivity (<i>Passaddhi</i>) (tranquillity, calm, being unmoved, affected, by contacts whether pleasant or unpleasant or not unpleasant but not pleasant, equanimity belongs here): On the one side is impassivity of body. On the other side is impassivity of mind. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Serenity (<i>Samādhi</i>) (being focused, concentrated, calm, being above it all): On the one side is whatever serenity is the result of contact with thinking and pondering. On the other side is whatever serenity is the result of being without contact with thinking and pondering. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detachment (<i>Upekhā</i>) (usually translated 'equanimity' but except when directed at the internal, the balance between one's reactions to pleasant and unpleasant sensations, this is detachment from all things connected to the senses; only 'detachment' works for both cases): On the one side is detachment from internal, personal things. On the other side is detachment from external, impersonal things. In this way it is two-sided.</p>

					<p class="f4">Regret. Not tracing regret back to the poor standards of ethics and self-control that resulted in shameful or blameworthy behavior such that sleepiness was preferable to recollection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drowsiness/inertia. Not tracing weariness back to not minding the balance between researching things, energy expenditure, and enthusiasm against impassivity, serenity and detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sleepiness after eating. Not tracing sleepiness after eating to eating to the point where the belly is full, or over-full, or greatly over-full, or hugely greatly over-full ... not recollecting the pleasure of the wakeful energetic state one experienced when eating just sufficiently to provide energy to carry on. Not tracing things back to the point where while eating one realized that the pleasure resulting from tasting was a transient thing. A trick resulting from variety fooling one into thinking that this pleasure was a continuous thing. ... until it results in (well, let us not look too closely) sloth and sleepiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mental Torpidity. Not tracing things back to the point where one gave in to fatigue, laziness, inertia, sloth, torpor, drowsiness, boredom.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">On the 'Mind'<Br />
					of<Br />
					'The Mind That Cognizes Things'<Br />
					from <i>The Pāḷi English Dictionary</i></h4>

					<p class="f4"><i>Mano</i> represents the intellectual functioning of consciousness, while <i>viñnāṇa</i> represents the field of sense and sense-reaction ("perception"), and <i>citta</i> the subjective aspect of consciousness. The rendering with "mind" covers most of the connotation; sometimes it may be translated "thought." as "mind" it embodies the rational faculty of man, which, as the subjective side in our relation to the objective world, may be regarded as a special sense, acting on the world, a sense adapted to the rationality (reasonableness, <i>dhamma</i>) of the phenomena, as our eye is adapted to the visibility of the latter. Thus it ranges as the sixth sense in the classification of the senses and their respective spheres (the <i>āyatanāni</i> or relations of subject and object, the <i>ajjhattikāni</i> and the <i>bāhirāni:</i>. These are:<br />
					(1) <i>cakkhu</i> (eye) which deals with the sight of form <i>(rūpa);</i><br />
					(2) <i>sota</i> (ear) dealing with the hearing of sound <i>(sadda);</i><br />
					(3) <i>ghāna</i> (nose) with the smelling of smells <i>(gandha);</i><br />
					(4) <i>jivhā</i> (tongue), with the tasting of tastes <b>(rasa);</b><br />
					(5) <i>kāya</i> (touch), with the touching of tangible objects <i>(phoṭṭhabba);</i><br />
					(6) <i>mano,</i> with the sensing <i>(viññāya)</i> of rational objects or cognisables <i>(dhamma).</i> Thus it is the <i>sensus communis</i> which recognises the world as a<i>"mundus sensibilis" (dhamma).</i> Both sides are an inseparable unity: the mind fits the world as the eye fits the light, or in other words: <i>mano</i> is the counterpart of <i>dhammā,</i> the subjective <i>dhamma. Dhamma</i> in this sense is the rationality or lawfullness of the Universe, cosmic order, natural law. It may even be taken quite generally as the "empirical world" the material world), as the world of "things," of phenomena in general without specification as regards sound, sight, smell, etc. — <i>dhamma</i> as counterpart of <i>mano</i> is rather an abstract (pluralistic) representation of the world, <i>i.e.</i> the phenomena as such with a certain inherent rationality; <i>manas</i> is the receiver of these phenomena in their abstract meaning, it is the abstract sense, so to speak. Of course, to explain <i>manas</i> and its function one has to resort to terms of materiality, and thus it happens that the term <i>vijānāti,</i> used of <i>manas,</i> is also used of the fifth sense, that of touch (to which <i>mano</i> is closely related, <i>cf.</i> our English expressions of touch as denoting rational, abstract processes: warm and cold used figuratively; to grasp anything; terror-stricken; deeply moved feeling <i>cf.</i> Latin <i>palpare</i> to palpitate, etc.). We might say of the mind "sensing" that manas "senses" (as a refined sense of touch) the "sensibility" <i>(dhamma)</i> of the objects, or as <b>Cpd.</b> 183 expresses it "cognizable objects."</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/04_fours/an04.236.than.ati.htm">AN 4.236,</a> [Note: this sutta is numbered here to follow the PTS numbering and location in the Index here of its corresponding translations but is numbered 238 in his version of the text.] <i>Sattama Kamma Suttaṃ aka Bojjhaṇga Suttaṃ,</i> The Noble Path<br />
					The Buddha describes kamma in terms of dark and light deeds, using the Seven Dimensions of Awakening for the kamma that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither dark nor bright, kamma that ends kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that this sutta (and similarly for the previous sutta (already on this site) the Eight Dimensional Way) is saying that the Seven Dimensions of Awakening is constructed of <i>intentional not-doings.</i> That includes <i>'Sati'</i> (mind, minding, recollection, memory, attention) and <i>'Samādhi'</i> (serenity). It is not too difficult to see that <i>'Samādhi'</i> is constructed of a series of abandonings, each higher state being attained not by 'getting' but by 'letting go of the previous state,' but how do we understand <i>'sati'</i> to be intentional not-doing? <i>sati</i> in this case is recollection of body, sensation, mental-states and things seen through the lens of <i>Dhamma</i> with the idea of observing how they come to be, are maintained, and come to an end with the further idea of becoming thoroughly objectively detached from them. The intentional not-doing is the not becoming attached or identified with such things as they come into awareness (or are recollected). Woodward and Mrs. Rhys Davids have both remarked how it must be a distortion of the system originally taught by Gotama that all virtues are negative ones (<i>i.e.,</i> 'abstaining from'). This is the fact and it is an essential orientation required by anyone who would understand this system. The entire point of this series of suttas is that there is <i>kamma</i> which perpetuates <i>kamma</i> and living in the world and there is a sort of <i>kamma</i> which is the key to escaping <i>kamma</i> and that is intentionally not doing the sort of <i>kamma</i> that perpetuates <i>kamma</i> and living in the world. The Buddha's Methods always result in a good outcome, and on occasion and when asked Gotama does directly teach <i>kamma</i> that has positive worldly results (attaining beauty, wealth, health, long life, heavenly rebirth), but when the result is worldly gain, this is to be seen as a sort of failure in terms of the goal of his system ... a falling short of that which is higher and better.</p>

					<p class="f4">Today [Thursday, November 28, 2024] this holiday too has become consumed by consumerism, and has achieved the reputation for being a time and place where family gets together to argue. The rest of the year they bow their heads to their i-phones. I remember when we used to invite a stranger (usually far from home, from the nearby Moffet Field) to celebrate this holiday meal with us. Looking back at more recent Thansgivings where guests (although family friends, not strangers) were invited these meals were quite peaceful. It might be a good counter-measure to the tendency to have family bickering at this time when our thoughts should be on all the things we should be thankful for (most especially having enough to eat #1: <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualnidana.htm#ahara"><i>Āhāra</i>: food</a>) to make it a practice, to make it a custom, to make it part of the tradition ... like it used to be ... always to have guests at this meal.</p>

					The problem here is not really with the term, <i>Tathāgata.</i> "The that that got that." One who has achieved the goal in this system. The problem is, rather, with the understanding of <i>"Hoti"</i> which means, and was the way those at the time understood it, "becoming". So hearing it that way the idea is that one who has "got it" becomes, is, an on-going phenomena (this, by the way, is the view being held by Mrs. Rhys Davids — the error being made is that she insists that this is the only way to see this.) Again what must be remembered is that the objection here is not to the idea of becoming as such but to that as a view; a way of holding "one who has got it" in one way.</p>

					<p class="f4">The difference between <i>Ananta</i> (without ends) and <i>Asassata</i> (not eternal) (see the last four suttas) and their individual opposites is the difference between thinking that the world has beginnings and ends and thinking that though it may have beginnings and ends, it lasts in some way forever. Or thinking the opposite. 'The world' means everything that has existence. The whole thing should be applied to the idea of a self. And avoid the thought that one or another or both of these ideas is the correct one. That is the real point of these suttas: that views themselves are dependent on being identified with body. As long as you cling to thinking that this view or that is the correct one, you are attached to the pain that results. Let all views go!</p>

					Woodward here translates <i>'diṭṭhi'</i> as 'heresy'. This is not a correct translation, but is an interpretation put on the word when used of certain views. From the Buddhist perspective all views are essentially incorrect. <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (right view, or, better, consummate or high view) is 'high' or 'consummate' only in so far as it serves the goal.<br />
					Perceptions giving rise to views of the sort found in the last three suttas can be encountered by any meditator. The world is seen as arising images, then vibrating atoms and then even the vibration stops as well and it is very easy to conclude that there is no existing as a living being and that therefore there is no doing evil or good deeds as it is just illusions passing through illusions. It is for this reason that a thorough understanding that <i>kamma</i> is action based on intent is so important. Real or not, intentional acts produce subjectively experienced results, and that is as good as saying that the consensus reality must be respected and dealt with as it is subjectively experienced by the ordinary common man and that being the case the view that 'it exists' cannot be rationally denied even when it cannot be rationally asserted.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Not Self</h4>

					<p class="f4">Take a look. It's not that difficult to see. You are a composite. A conglomeration. The body is relatively easy to see: it is entirely the construction of mother and father. The way you see things comes primarily from them. Your attitude towards the world, persons, events the way you experience things, say your political position, usually also comes from them. Your anger. The things that make you happy. Your sense of humor or lack thereof. The way you see good or bad, beauty or ugliness in persons or things. Your ambitions or lack thereof. What you want to create as experiences for yourself. Your very awareness of knowing things all come from the outside. The way you smile. The gestures you use when speaking. The way you stand or sit or lie down. This smile is from that character in that episode on TV. That attitude or expression or style of writing or living 'of mine' comes from that Dylan Thomas, Lenny Levinson, Marcel Proust, Thomas Carlyle book I read. Or movie I saw. I remember a time in N.Y. where half the people were looking and acting like Serpico. (Are you aware that you can be seen by those with good memories (and sooner or later we will be able to remember it all!) of what is to be seen? 'Ah, this one is using terminology used in a song by Carl Sandburg, or Bob Dylan, or Joni Mitchel, or Minni Riverton, or in a speech by F.D.R, or John Kennedy, or Donald Trump,  his nature is such as that.) The choice of clothing comes from advertisements and influencers. The implements you use for cooking, the foods you eat, the way you decorate your abode. What you think of as disease. Even the diseases you suffer. The way you take a dump or pee. Your very thoughts are the work of a comity. A judgment as to which of the various opinions you have heard about a thing that you will use or scorn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Everything. Look deeply, you will not find a thing there that has not been adopted, pasted into place to form what you then think of as "me" or "mine'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <i>bhikkhus</i> are not exempt! Even the aristocrats, the Arahants. Buddhists, real Buddhists are "sons of the Sakkyan", they imitate, the way they see, in mind, down to the syllable, in word, in the perfection of their behavior, in body. The fake or misguided are just the imitators of fakers or the misguided ... they need to check the depth of wisdom of their re-sources.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is nothing there that is the real self of you to which these things attach.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha has given us this information in the concise way he has because it is in that way that the various sorts of beings will be able to see the truth of it. Seeing that there is no thing there that is the self or can be called 'mine' one creates a distance there from that thing. He calls it 'disgust' not having a taste for it. We don't like being an imitation ... at least for anything less than the best. And the best is saying the eye, visible objects, visual object sensation, perception, own-making, consciousness are not the self; let them go, put them away, that will be for your good and happiness for many a long night.</p>

					The Buddha states that the view that had there been no being in the past, there would be no thinking of a self in the present, that there not being any thinking of self in the present there would be no thinking of a self in the future arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind.<br />

					<p class="f4">How true, that there is nothing dead in this Universe; that what we call dead is only changed, its forces working in inverse order! 'The leaf that lies rotting in moist winds,' says one, 'has still force; else how could it rot? 'Our whole Universe is but an infinite Complex of Forces; thousandfold, from Gravitation up to Thought and Will; man's Freedom environed with Necessity of Nature: in all which nothing at Any moment slumbers, but all is for ever awake and busy. The thing that lies isolated inactive thou shalt nowhere discover; seek everywhere, from the granite mountain, slow-mouldering since Creation, to the passing cloud-vapour, to the living man; to the action, to the spoken word of man. The word that is spoken, as we know, flies irrevocable; not less, but more, the action that is done. 'The gods themselves,' sings Pindar, 'cannot annihilate the action that is done.' No: this, once done, is done always; cast forth into endless Time; and, long conspicuous or soon hidden, must verily work and grow for ever there, an indestructible new element in the Infinite of Things. Or, indeed, what is this Infinite of Things itself, which men name Universe, but an Action, a sum-total of Actions and Activities? The living ready-made sum-total of these three, — which Calculation cannot add, cannot bring on its tablets; yet the sum, we say, is written visible: All that has been done, All that is doing, All that will be done! Understand it well, the Thing thou beholdest, that Thing is an Action, the product and expression of exerted Force: the All of Things is an infinite conjugation of the verb To do. Shoreless Fountain-Ocean of Force, of power to do; wherein Force rolls and circles, billowing, many-streamed, harmonious; wide as Immensity, deep as Eternity; beautiful and terrible, not to be comprehended: this is what man names Existence and Universe; this thousand-tinted Flame-image, at once veil and revelation, reflex such as he, in his poor brain and heart, can paint, of One Unnameable, dwelling in inaccessible light! From beyond the Star-galaxies, from before the Beginning of Days, it billows and rolls, — round thee, nay thyself art of it, in this point of Space where thou now standest, in this moment which thy clock measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, apart from all Transcendentalism, is it not a plain truth of sense, which the duller mind can even consider as a truism, that human things wholly are in continual movement, and action and reaction; working continually forward, phasis after phasis, by unalterable laws, towards prescribed issues? How often must we say, and yet not rightly lay to heart: The seed that is sown, it will spring! Given the summer's blossoming, then there is also given the autumnal withering: so is it ordered not with seedfields only, but with transactions, arrangements, philosophies, societies, French Revolutions, whatsoever man works with in this lower world. The Beginning holds in it the End, and all that leads thereto; as the acorn does the oak and its fortunes. Solemn enough, did we think of it, — which unhappily, and also happily, we do not very - much! Thou there canst begin; the Beginning is for thee, and there: but where, and of what sort, and for whom will the End be? All grows, and seeks and endures its destinies: consider likewise how much grows, as the trees do, whether we think of it or not. So that when your Epimenides, your somnolent Peter Klaus, since named Rip van Winkle, awakens again, he finds it a changed world. In that seven-years sleep of his, so much has changed! All that is without us will change while we think not of it; much even that is within us. The truth that was yesterday a restless Problem, has today grown a Belief burning to be uttered: on the morrow, contradiction has exasperated it into mad Fanaticism; obstruction has dulled it into sick Inertness; it is sinking towards silence, of satisfaction or of resignation. Today is not Yesterday, for man or for thing. Yesterday there was the oath of Love; today has come the curse of Hate. Not willingly: ah, no; but it could not help coming. The golden radiance of youth, would it willingly have tarnished itself into the dimness of old age! — Fearful: how we stand enveloped, deep-sunk, in that Mystery of Time; and are Sons of Time; fashioned and woven out of Time; and on us, and on all that we have, or see, or do, is written: Rest not, Continue not, Forward to thy doom!</p>

One reason for including it here as a separate file is that the long term goal, (of merging it with the PED) has only a very slim chance of ever being realized and by itself it is an important historical document. I also note that the Dictionary itself is still at this time frequently used by translators when the PED is not helpful. Of note would be Childers' position concerning the relationship of the <i>Pāḷi</i> language to Sanskrit and the Vedas, his theory concerning the disappearance of the original Sinhalese commentary; his position concerning whether or not the Dhamma should be translated or should be learnt using the language it was conceived in.

					<p class="f4">Frightful to all men is Death; from of old named King of Terrors. Our little compact home of an Existence, where we dwelt complaining, yet as in a home, is passing, in dark agonies, into an Unknown of Separation, Foreignness, unconditioned Possibility. The Heathen Emperor asks of his soul: Into what places art thou now departing? The Catholic King must answer: To the Judgment-bar of the Most High God! Yes, it is a summing-up of Life; a final settling, and giving-in the "account of the deeds done in the body:" they are done now; and lie there unalterable, and do bear their fruits, long as Eternity shall last.</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p class="f4">But figure his thought, when Death is now clutching at his own heart-strings, unlooked for, inexorable! Yes, poor Louis, Death has found thee. No palace walls or life-guards, gorgeous tapestries or gilt buckram of stiffest ceremonial could keep him out; but he is here, here at thy very life-breath, and will extinguish it. Thou, whose whole existence hitherto was a chimera and scenic show, at length becomest a reality: sumptuous Versailles bursts asunder, like a dream, into void Immensity; Time is done, and all the scaffolding of Time falls wrecked with hideous clangour round thy soul: the pale Kingdoms yawn open; there must thou enter, naked, all unking'd, and await what is appointed thee! Unhappy man, there as thou turnest, in dull agony, on thy bed of weariness, what a thought is thine! Purgatory and Hell-fire, now all-too possible, in the prospect; in the retrospect, — alas, what thing didst thou do that were not better undone; what mortal didst thou generously help; what sorrow hadst thou mercy on? Do the "five hundred thousand" ghosts, who sank shamefully on so many battle-fields from Rossbach to Quebec, that thy Harlot might take revenge for an epigram, — crowd round thee in this hour? Thy foul Harem; the curses of mothers, the tears and infamy of daughters? Miserable man! thou "hast done evil as thou couldst:" thy whole existence seems one hideous abortion and mistake of Nature; the use and meaning of thee not yet known. Wert thou a fabulous Griffin, devouring the works of men; daily dragging virgins to thy cave; — clad also in scales that no spear would pierce: no spear but Death's? A Griffin not fabulous but real! Frightful, O Louis, seem these moments for thee. — We will pry no further into the horrors of a sinner's death-bed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Tiracchāna-kathā</i> usually translated "animal talk". <i>Tiracchāna</i> from <i>Tiraccha</i> meaning: (PED) "across, obliquely; in <i>°bhūta</i> deviating, going wrong, swerving from the right direction." So <i>tiracchāna</i> really characterizes the manner in which certain animals mobilize. It does not mean "animal". When applied to speech, it should revert to the literal meaning: "speech going horizontally," not making a point or pointing to a wrong course." Translating it "animal-talk" obscures rather than clarifies. I have made this error in my own translations and will correct them when I come across them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I think it is time we started to acknowledge a few things that are rejected without a second thought by our science, like, for example, listening when our great hero of the word says: "There are more things on heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." It's getting a little stuffy in here. A little narrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a difference in degree and a huge difference in outcome between the meditation procedure required for clairvoyance, clairaudience and the various magic powers and the procedure for attaining <i>Sammā Samādhi.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This difference in degree has become obscured and the confusion which has resulted is leading many to believe they have attained <i>Sammā Samādhi</i> because they have attained, or partially attained, the various magic powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">The procedure for the attaining of the various magic powers can/may lead into the procedure for attaining <i>Sammā Samādhi,</i> but is 'earlier' and goes in the opposite direction — getting rather than letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both procedures are described as one sequence in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p128">MN 128</a> where Gotama first advises the Anuruddhas as to attaining the light, clairvoyance and clairaudience, and then describes his recognition that what he was doing at the same time as he was attaining various stages of magic power was also letting go of various mental obstructions.

					What appears to be missing from many people's picture of this situation is the recognition that a transition has taken place when the Buddha goes from attainment of the skills needed for magic powers — </p>

							<p class="f4 in2">But at the time<br />
							when my concentration is not limited<br />
							my vision is boundless,<br />
							so with boundless vision<br />
							for a whole night<br />
							and a whole day<br />
							and a whole night and day<br />
							I both perceive a boundless light-manifestation<br />
							and see a boundless (number of) material shapes.'<br /><span class="f1">—Horner translation</span></p>

					<p class="f4">which is happening before his awakening<br />
					to the recognition that this procedure has also resulted in his getting rid of various defilements of his mind. — </p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When I knew, Anuruddhas, that<br />
							doubt,<br />
							lack of proper attention,<br />
							sloth and torpor,<br />
							consternation,<br />
							elation,<br />
							distress,<br />
							too much energy,<br />
							too feeble an energy,<br />
							longing,<br />
							perception of diversity,<br />
							the state of being too intent on material shapes,<br />
							was a defilement of the mind,<br />
							the defilement of the mind<br />
							that is doubt<br />
							was got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">and that he was developing at the same time a process of letting go: first of Vitakka
					then of Vicara ... etc. ... more or less the procedure for attaining <i>Sammā Samadhi</i> that is frequently described in the suttas:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Here, beggars, a beggar<br />
							separating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
							separating himself from unskillful things,<br />
							with thinking,<br />
							with pondering<br />
							isolation-born pleasurable-enthusiasm<br />
							rises up into and<br />
							makes a habitat of<br />
							The First Knowledge.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
							a beggar,<br />
							dissolving thought and pondering,<br />
							internally self-pacified,<br />
							become whole-heartedly single minded,<br />
							without thinking,<br />
							without pondering,<br />
							rises up into and<br />
							makes a habitat of<br />
							The Second Knowledge.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
							a beggar,<br />
							with the vanishing of enthusiasm, and<br />
							living detached,<br />
							minding,<br />
							self-aware, and<br />
							pleased,<br />
							experiencing in his own body<br />
							that of which the Aristocrats speak<br />
							when they say:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Detached, minding, he lives pleasantly'</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">rises up into and makes a habitat of<br />
							The Third Knowledge.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
							a beggar,<br />
							letting go of pleasures,<br />
							letting go of pains,<br />
							settling down the antecedent mental ease and mental pain,<br />
							without pain, but<br />
							without pleasure,<br />
							detached,<br />
							recollected,<br />
							surpassingly pure,<br />
							rises up into and makes a habitat of<br />
							The Fourth Knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first portion of these instructions to the Anuruddhas in MN 128 can then be equated to "desire for sense pleasures and involvements with unskillful things" while the second portion is an arrival at a going to less and less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this realization, while having magic powers, he was not yet enlightened; it is only after recognition of the fact that he was letting things go in the process, that he found the path to awakening, later to be called <i>Sammā Samādhi.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is vital that people understand this! If at death one believes that one has attained the end of rebirth, <i>kamma,</i> pain through getting, then the <i>Nibbāna</i> attained will be a thing attained and a thing attained is a thing that comes to an end. In other words, it is not <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping after the progress in understanding of one's followers is not the same thing as teaching out of compassion. Grasping after the progress of one's followers is self-directed and when met with a lack of progress can lead the teacher to anger and the use of any means that he thinks will work which can result in methods that are way out of bounds in terms of the manner in which a teacher should be seen to behave. It may look like such a method has resulted in progress, but what it is teaching is going the wrong direction. Setting a bad example. Demonstrating grasping where what is needed for the greater good is the example of the advantages of letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">You're not just teaching one person; you are teaching anyone who has been in contact with anyone who has witnessed this behavior and anyone who has heard of it from anyone who has heard of it from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So now: All Together. These PDF files make a series characterized by emphasis on the suttas while presenting a focus on a particular topic. They are not easy reads; they are meant to be printed out and used as study guides along with the on-line versions and the translations should be compared with the other translations. The repetitions are included and should not be skipped! They are important learning devices. At any point where there is an internal rebellion against reading a repetition one should put it to the side to be read later. It is saying: Slow down!<br />
					I'm not telling you what to do, but if you want to get the most out of these works, think through what is presented until you believe you see the point, then give yourself the time to ponder (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>!). But at this point one is not yet done. When the point is understood intellectually, and seen to be useful, then make an effort to see how it operates in your world and make the appropriate adjustments to your behavior.<br />

					<p>Sariputta teaches Wanderers that ask about who causes <i>kammic</i> consequences that it is in all cases contact (here translated literally as 'touch') that results in <i>kammic</i> consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Ānanda remarking on how interesting it is that the whole doctrine could be stated with one phrase like this, when asked to do so, gives a version of the sequence in detail.<br />
					Although it is stated in different words by Ānanda, what is being said is that it is because of deliberate intention resulting from ignorance that 'self' is projected into the contact of consciousness with named forms that is then experienced as "I am experiencing". Consequently it is a matter of eliminating the ignorance that propels this projecting of self into such contact that brings pain to an end. So it is here that you can see that what this formula is showing is  personalization, that is, 'own-making'. The formula is not so much showing how an impersonal pain comes about as showing how it is because of the injection of personal identification by way of identification with the intent to create personal experience through thought, word and deed that the result is identified-with pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suttas 4—10 are identical. They tell us  that the previous six Buddhas and Gotama have all gone through the same thought processes in arriving at their vision of the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada,</i> aka "The Middle Way."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Middle Way is not a way describing moderation. I have said this a few times but it needs repetition. There is plenty nuf moderation in Buddhism, but when 'The Middle Way' is being spoken of it points to the method to use the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way, or the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> or any of the multiplicity of Ways that constitute the Buddhist method for escape from <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, pain. Restraining the self from going, doing, acting either in a manner indicating approval, liking, or thinking of it as the only way, etc. or in a manner indicating disapproval, dislike, or thinking of it as the only way, etc.</p>

					<p class="f4">For example: You have decided to give the Buddhist method a try. You find yourself hearing about the horseless carriage. In stead of forming an opinion about this, you abstain from approval and disapproval and mind your own business. This is the point of <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi,</i> high or consummate or best view. It keeps your opinions out of the picture. Your job, as an explorer of Buddhism, or as a teacher of Buddhism, is the escape from <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, pain, not the way this new technology will affect you or the interests of the world. Your job is not to comment on or have useless opinions about the horseless carriage.  You hear about Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. You refrain from writing slanderous second hand hearsay articles about these people (<i>Sammā Sankappa</i> and <i>Sammā Vaca</i>). And on up the list.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the result? You have more time to devote to what is your real business: the study of, or teaching of Buddhism. You do not waste your very very short time here trying to change the world — in the end a useless, fruitless effort. You make fewer enemies. You make no bad <i>kamma</i> and so experience no journey in remorseland because of that. And you see by that a little bit of <i>Nibbāna.</i> You get a little taste of what freedom really means. You may even see the nack and pull yourself entirely free of this mess. That would be called "setting a good example." That is what is in back of your desire to change the world anyway ... or so we can hope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Book Recommendation: <b>Gold Wrapped in Rags,</b> The Autobiography of Ajaan Jia Cundo, Translated by Ajaan Dick Sīlaratano. You can get this in PDF format from this site <a href="../../resources/pdf/jia-cundo/gold_wrapped_in_rags.pdf">here,</a> or you can download a free copy in pdf, e-pub or mobi formats from <a href="https://forestdhamma.org">Forest Dhamma monastery,</a> or you can request a free hard copy from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I first learned of this book reading ffrank's blog <a href="https://notesonthedhamma.blogspot.com">Notes on the Dhamma</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The book is one of the most inspiring books I have read in a long time, beautifully designed and the translation is what I would call "smooth", virtually invisible. The last chapters are not autobiography, but biography, and I wish only that it had ended with the death of Ajaan Jia. I could have lived without the last few pages of the biography that deal with the theoretical position of the <i>bhikkhus</i> of the Forest school.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the autobiography, magic powers are discussed openly and in such a way as to make them perfectly believable; and as far as it goes Ajaan Jia describes his practice in detail and step by step. I will refrain from trying to describe this work any further, but it is necessary to say that it is not the product of a completely free mind but it is close enough to think (and we can hope) that, as was predicted by Ajaan Mun, Ajaan Jia could have achieved the final end at his death.</p>

The basic content of these suttas is also presented in many other locations in the suttas. I suggest that this is an indication of the importance of this sutta to the understanding of the Buddha's system. Further, it is a good example of how a sutta was passed from hand to hand.</p>

Number "11" in the second case in both the positive and negative versions should refer to the cowherd, not the bhikkhu, and the concluding "11s", in both versions should begin with the cowherd, and have the bhikkhu in the center and conclude with the cowherd.</p>

					<p class="f4">These two are identical. This sutta often figures in the discussion concerning whether or not the <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for awakening. Here the interesting thing is that a careful reading of the sutta tells us that it is not really the <i>jhānas</i> or the <i>Brahma-viharas,</i> or the formless realms that bring about <i>Nibbāna,</i> but that these must all be seen as made for the sake of (with the intent of creating) identified-with experience, and must be let go.</p>

					<p class="f4">He reflects on that<br />
					and understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, for sure,<br />
					the first knowledge (and the rest of the <i>jhānas,</i> the<i> Brahma-viharas,</i> and the formless realms) is<br />
					a higher own-making,<br />
					a higher own-intent,<br />
					and furthermore<br />
					anything that is<br />
					higher own-made<br />
					higher own-intended<br />
					is impermanent<br />
					an ending thing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, taking a stand on that,<br />
					arrives at destruction of<br />
					the corrupting influences.</p>

					<p class="f4">If not arriving at destruction of<br />
					the corrupting influences<br />
					then with such as your <i>Dhamma-</i>desire,<br />
					with such as your <i>Dhamma-</i>delight<br />
					with the utter destruction of the<br />
					five yokes connected to lower selfhood-birth<br />
					he is spontaneously reborn<br />
					attaining final <i>Nibbāna</i> there,<br />
					not returning to things of this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, then, householder,<br />
					is a teaching,<br />
					taught by The Lucky Man,<br />
					one who knows and sees,<br />
					aristocrat,<br />
					Consummately Self-Awakened,<br />
					whereby a beggar,<br />
					living without carelessness,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute,<br />
					will free<br />
					his unfree heart, and<br />
					will achieve total destruction<br />
					of the not yet totally destroyed<br />
					corrupting influences, and<br />
					where one who has not reached<br />
					the ultimate<br />
					peace from the yoke<br />
					reaches such peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">The conclusion is that the <i>Magga</i> is only one of several different paths that lead one to the point where, by eradicating the <i>Āsavas, Nibbāna</i> can be reached by letting that path go. Each individual path separately, or the first <i>jhāna</i> only, or the full set of four, or the other paths or all of them together are all sufficient to bring one to this position. From the viewpoint of the Arahant they will all be seen as equivalants; the differences between them would be seen as constructed to meet the differences in the dispositions of individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Appamādā"</i> it is a good example of the way almost everyone is mistranslating.</p>

					<p class="f4">They translate this word as:</p>

					<p class="f4">PED: thoughtfulness, carefulness, conscientiousness, watchfulness, vigilance, earnestness, zeal, alertness, care, caution, diligence, heedlessness ...;</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Bodhi: heedfulness;<br />

					Bhikkhu Sujato: diligence;<br />
					Woodward: earnestness;<br />
					Mrs. Rhys Davids: diligence ... .</p>

					<p class="f4">There are probably others but these come easily to hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">However the word <i>"pamādā"</i> is thought of, the word <i>"appamādā"</i> means: <b>NOT</b>-that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Negative opposites. If you actually care about rebirth and follow what the Buddha taught about how to achieve that you will see that it is a method almost completely dependent on not-doing. (To be precise, the doing which is not-doing that ends doing.) We are not to give up one way of being just to get another way of being. We are not to give up carelessness to get carefulness; we are to give up carelessness period.	NOT<i>-pamādā.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is not just the same thing. It is not going from one state to another, it is just not going any further with this state.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are masses of these negative opposites that are being translated as positive states. It is not unimportant: what we are doing here is trying to end the actions we perform that create further becoming, existence, life. If we get stuck and need help from the sutta translations and they are pointing to a state involving becoming this is something that can be easily overlooked and is a big huge misleading mistake.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Absorption" cannot be the correct word to use for what is described as "attaining one state by abandoning another." Neither can any term or description of this skill that implies or requires action be appropriate. This is a system built on letting go of everything, that is everything in this world, absolutely everything, absorption is precisely not letting go.</p>

					<p class="f4">You start out like everyone else, absorbed by the world. You find a place to be alone and you sit up straight and then take the mind and place it around the area of the mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is your center or home base or the starting place of your focus.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, then, you experience yourself enjoying sense pleasures and unskillful things.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that point (though it may take some time) you let go (that is not doing) of thoughts about and pondering of sense pleasures and unskillful things.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are absorbed by a sexual fantasy. You are not absorbed when you let that fantasy go. All the insights you gain in the <i>jhānas</i> are of the same nature: the freedom attained from letting go of something that has the mind absorbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The result is a subtle form of pleasure <i>(sukha)</i> (not being disturbed by thoughts about and pondering of sense pleasures and unskillful things), and you have left, the clear thinking and pondering of your situation (and later, everything else that you question concerning the <i>Dhamma</i>).</p>

					<p class="f4">The first thing you encounter then is that it has been your being alone that has given you this pleasure. That is called appreciation (I also call it enthusiasm sometimes. It is of the same nature.) (an early form of <i>pīti</i>).</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the first <i>jhāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">After you have placed the mind <i>(sati-parimukham),</i> nothing there required you to do anything but let go. This is not absorption.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same process applies to the next three <i>jhānas.</i> You notice that there is something in your present situation which is disturbing your peace and you let it go.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The difference between "not-doing" and "doing nothing"</h4>

					<p class="f4">To physically understand the difference between "doing nothing" (which, by definition, is a doing, and is, therefore, impossible) and "not-doing" (which is important to the understanding of every phase of the <i>Pāḷi</i> practice, especially for <i>Jhānas,</i> clench your fist using extreme pressure. Hold the fist clenched for a few seconds, until you can focus on the mechanics of what you are doing. Then, without opening the fist or moving a muscle with intention, let go of the tension that is causing the fist to clench. This is not "doing" anything, this is the letting go of (the ending of) the doing that was the clenching. This example, demonstrated through the physical body, applies as well to all forms of grasping: grasping of the body; grasping after sense experience; grasping after perceptions; grasping after the creation of your own world; and grasping after consciousness.</p>

I think, however, that they should all be read through and given a good pondering. Further, they should be read along with the previous two. It looks to me as though this was the way suttas were originally memorized. Certainly it explains how a sutta (or what was thought of as the important part of a sutta if #s 1-3 are to be read as one sutta) could be heard throughout a large audience.</p>

					<p class="f4">This sutta should be read with the previous one (just below). Although it is not overtly mentioned in the suttas, I believe it is taken as a matter of common knowledge (there, then, not here, now; which points to the fact that they had better vision then than is evident here now) that forming an intent brings about the thing intended. Not always when or how  one would wish, but sooner or later. There is at least one school of Buddhism that uses this wish-fulfiling aspect of thought as the basis of its popularity. This is also similar to the way intent is used by Don Juan, though the function of his having his apprentices go around thinking and saying "Intent!" seems like a joke to me. What is the case here is that Gotama is telling us that forming an intent is not necessary for the purposes and advantages of attaining freedom through knowing and seeing if one is devoted to living according to the Buddhist understanding (skillful) of ethical standards.</p>

					<p class="f1">*From <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p1">AN 10.1</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The difference here from my translation of AN 10.1 is that I went from translating from the <i>Pāḷi</i> and PED to translating from the <i>Pāḷi,</i> PED and experience — not that I did not have the experience, such as it was at the time, but that I did not closely examine the terms I would use to describe the experience. <i>Sīla</i> can mean "virtues". There is nothing wrong with having virtue, but "virtue" is greatly misused today in that the emphasis is on conduct that would be better headed under morality (conduct approved of as good by the majority, rather than derived from a principle). There is no mention in the <i>Pāḷi</i> of "conduct", but I suppose that can be inferred. One sometimes has remorse from conduct that is not ethically good; sometimes not. What is consistently present in those striving for purity of ethical conduct is the self criticizing the self for breaches of such conduct. I do not see "joy" arising from following skillful ethical standards. What is there when one looks is congratulations or satisfaction with the self or relief from fear of the consequences of breaches. Getting "approval" from <i>"pīti"</i> requires only that one understand this term as encompassing all sorts of liking, from moderate liking to rapture. I do not see rapture there at all, but I also do not think that rapture leads to calm or tranquility. What liking the situation does lead to is being pleased with one's behavior. The difference between "through" and "by", and "knowledge of" comes from what you think this series is about — is it a method to accomplish the goal, or is it a method for seeing the goal as accomplished? The sutta purports to be discussing the purposes and advantages.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/"><b>Open Buddhist University.</b></a> A huge but very well organized and beautifully presented collection of references to Buddhist works of all sorts.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <a href="https://index.readingfaithfully.org/">Index at Reading Faithfully.</a> The site defaults to the translations of <i>Bhikkhu</i> Sujato but these can be ignored and the translations here can be found by just using the sutta id. Links to some other translators such as those of Bhikkhu Anandajoti and Bhikkhu Thanissaro are obtainable there by clicking on the gear icon at the top of the page and selecting "reference helper".</p>

					<p class="f4">As expected, the Bhikkhu Sujato translations are now increasingly being used throughout the web. The objection here to these translations is that they reflect the activist Buddhist view. It is not just that important words are mistranslated, but that the entire set is world-oriented. Using the set while changing a few words will not do. While the Buddha freely gives advice to the world-oriented, becoming (living, being, existing) of any sort (as low as the Hells to as high as becoming in the sphere of the ending of perception and experience in the world), any sort of sense-experience, world-orientation, is all considered a lesser, even a failure at achieving the goal in this system. The goal in this system is the escape from sense-experience, <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, pain, but not just wordly pain. It is a hopeless cause, but there may be some who find this world intolerable and really see the point of escape and the efficacy of the Buddha's methods for doing so. To be constantly thrown back into a worldly view by a translation is a very dangerous thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you get upset because the phone tree goes on forever before giving you the way to reach a live person, your mind is giving you a clue that you have expectations.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have an expectation and things turn out differently than the way you expected, and you get upset, that is a sign, a track of your having some investment in that expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is a sign that you think of yourself as occupying a station above the reality.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you finally do reach a live person at the end of the phone tree and they do not have the information you were seeking and you take out your feelings of frustration on that person, that is an outward sign or track of the same belief that things should be going the way you think they should be going.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is entirely a set-up for upset. Making yourself feel bad. And, for one thing that sign, or track fills the emptiness, and can be seen by those with clear sight as you holding on to that belief. So you have made yourself unhappy and you have given others reason to think you are, at the least, a fool.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not think you cannot be seen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when things do go your way, that delight you feel is just as much a sign of this same sort of belief system and has the same implications and gives the same information to anyone who wishes to know it.</p>

					<p class="f4">One more thing: With expectations and reactions of liking and disliking the way things really are is obscured. You do not see the story the way it is really unfolding. You are missing one of the greatest joys of this life. That is another way of saying you are blind. To live without expectations, to be satisfied with things the way they are, is to see. And to see is to enjoy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here and there on the internet we find objections to the use by the Buddha of what is thought to be the harsh handling of fools, by the calling of them "fools" by the Buddha. This is really a mis-hearing of the tone of this term by those individuals. It is heard relative to the context. Those guilty of silly thinking will not feel the impact of being called a fool as deeply as those guilty of offences that will result in great unhappiness to many.
					As readers many centuries later we should rather think that the intent here was to shake up the person addressed. Get him to realize the seriousness of his offence. But, if the reader finds it difficult to believe that the Buddha would address foolish individuals as "foolish" or "fools", he should look to the origin of this term in <i>Pāḷi</i> (PED) where the word is actually "childish" or "young" with the meaning of the lack of understanding of the child or youth.</p>

					<p class="f4">As for the use of this term on this site, it is done with the following ideas in mind:<br />
					it is rendered harmless today in that it is not directed at any living person;<br />
					it is used because today the pair "wise man" and "fool" are the usages in practice;<br />
					it is used because any person today that has intentions or thinks thoughts or speaks words or does acts that produce unpleasantness is a fool;<br />
					it is used because such an individual is not a real person, that is in reality such a one is a mindless robot that intentionally (even if not his own intentions) inflicts the unpleasant on others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a look at <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p15">AN 10.15.</a> Ask yourself how it could be that a simple word like <i>Appamāda,</i> (translations: don't be careless, Earnestness, Seriousness, etc.) could be given such an exalted status.</p>

					<p class="f4">One of the last things experienced by most people when they die is the thought, based on the perception that because the personal mind perceives things coming into existence as being simultaneous with their thoughts of such a thing coming into existence, that they were, after all, really God, the Creator, and that all their suffering was just a big joke. And they are overtaken by a laughter that carries them off to the new state of consciousness they deserve.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">What Language is the <i>Pāḷi?</i></h4>

					<p class="f4">There is a lot of steam and paper wasted in the effort to prove one theory or another as to what exactly <i>Pāḷi</i> is as a language and what language the Buddha actually used. I think a more productive way to deal with this issue is to let it go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let what was said in the <i>Pāḷi</i> be what the Buddha said in his own words and forget looking for the "real" language he may have spoken or where <i>Pāḷi</i> might have come from. The place it came from doesn't exist! And except as a waste of time, it doesn't matter. What we have in the suttas as we have them, even in translation, will get you out of this mess if you take the time to understand what was said there.</p>

					<p class="f4">The most reasonable way to think of this is the same way that today and yesterday and the day before that any writer worth his salt has used his own language, and it is really his own invention applicable to his works alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">What that is is the language he grew up with, the language he has heard around him, the language he heard his parents and grandparents and great-grandparents use and that was the language they heard spoken by their parents and grandparents and great grandparents back seven generations or more. And it is what he invents at the time to convey his ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">What we see as his writing is going to have scraps from way back and from other languages and (especially in the case of a seer like Gotama) it will have an influence on the way language is used way into the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">We can see that even in translation the <i>Pāḷi</i> is influencing the way English (and almost every other language) is being used today ... just take a look at the way the people are writing on the forums. You try to pin-point the one language this work came from you are barking up the wrong tree and you are distracting people! That is not a good thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">You think there is no bad <i>kamma</i> comes with making a big thing of this study, you have another think coming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Work on this website is basically done to the point of sufficiency for those interested in the study and practice of Buddhism. What you get from here is extra. Things that may be helpful, but are not essential to understanding. Corrections to errors will continue to be made.</p>

					<p class="f4">The site was among the first dealing with the Buddhism found in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and had the idea of getting <i>something</i> helpful out there which others could work with and improve upon. The result was too much haste and the result of that was a super-sufficiency of typographical and spelling errors. For some time now it has been the effort here to rid the site of those errors, but many remain. Errors in doctrine are a matter of opinion and one of the purposes of the site was to provide a multiplicity of views on these matters. In recent times the number of differing opinions concerning doctrine has the appearance of having multiplied, but a careful reading will show that virtually all of these are sub-doctrines of those dealt with earlier.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among the things that are being done in the very relaxed post-sufficiency way is adding italics to the foreign words of the <i>Pāḷi</i> dictionary found <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm">here</a>. I am updating this file only haphazardly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Edit: [Sunday, January 05, 2025 3:45 AM] This has now been completed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doing this has necessitated reading the entries very closely and that has brought to my attention a lot of errors, some dating back as far as the original scanning, many introduced by my clumsy handling of regular expressions. <i>"Pali"</i> may have been converted to <i>"Pāḷi",</i> many commas "," may have been seen in the original scanning as periods "."; a massive regular expression error was the joining of "a" to the following word (e.g. "a house" became "ahouse"; and again I think in the original scan, some words have been broken up, as in "mo tion" for "motion."</p>

					<p class="f4">Edit: [Sunday, January 05, 2025 3:46 AM] Where found, these things have been corrected. This does not mean this file is error-free, but it is now usable.</p>

					<p class="f4">PS: The entire dictionary is on one page (file) and can therefor be searched in your browser by using "CTRL f". Search main entries using "::[space][word]". It is most often necessary when looking up a word in this dictionary to strip off the prefixes and suffixes and the word-endings ā and ṃ,  and sometimes it will require searching for the term not as a main entry but in the main body.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are now several <i>Pāḷi</i>/English dictionaries available in digital form, and several programs that allow one to find the English term used to translate the <i>Pāḷi</i> which, of course, just confirms the translation being used. I have not seen any dictionary or translation tool that is quite as complete as this version and I continue to use it almost every day because it provides word-history and relationships and allows choice by giving possible alternative meanings.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Faith and Its Connection to Stream-Winning</h4>

					<p class="f4">For the person who in the world,<br />
					attached to,<br />
					in bondage to,<br />
					having greed for,<br />
					being overtaken by<br />
					lust for sense-pleasures;<br />
					attached to,<br />
					in bondage to,<br />
					having greed for,<br />
					being overtaken by<br />
					lust for points of view,<br />
					it is impossible to see,<br />
					the existence of any other person.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not saying that belief in others is impossible,<br />
					indeed, it is not only not impossible,<br />
					it is usually the case,<br />
					but that case is a matter of belief,<br />
					it is not something that has actually been seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing without resort to sensory perception is the difference that makes a person a Streamwinner-in-fact as opposed to the Streamwinner by belief.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Streamwinner-in-fact does not slip back; the Streamwinner-by-belief becomes a Streamwinner-in-fact if he hangs on, but is subject to the possibility of slipping out of his belief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing without resort to perception through the senses is accomplished by a person when they see the problem of endlessly recycling rebirths in <i>saṃsara</i> and can see that this problem is solved by the idea that there is no thing there that is the self and that all sensory perception of the world as an existing thing can therefore be brought to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this is seen the idea that someone out there has actually accomplished the deed is essential; seeing this as the solution to that problem is seeing that someone has actually accomplished the deed. This is faith in the Awakening of the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is seeing that this knowledge is the method that will bring the endless cycle of rebirths to an end. This is faith in the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing what needs to be done is half the problem, the rest is accomplishing it. This is done by the step-by-step letting go of any identification (seeing anything as the self or as belonging to the self) with the entire existing world and the not-doing of any deed that extends identification with the existence of the world. Seeing that this is a gradual process is seeing the four basic stages: Streamwinning, Once Returning, Non-Returning, and Arahantship and the enjoyment, release in freedom, that follows such attainment. This is faith in the <i>Saṇgha.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The step-by-step letting go of any identification with the entire existing world and the not-doing of any deed that extends identification with the existence of the world is accomplished by the application to the existing being of the steps found in the Way:</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate point of view — this is all essentially pain, this pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> is a result of wanting, this pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> is ended by ending the wanting, and this is the way to do all that — as a working hypothesis;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate principles based on that point of view — let it all go, inflict no intentional physical harm, inflict no intentional mental cruelty;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate speech — No intentional untrue, cruel, harsh, slanderous or useless talk;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate works — No intentional working harm, taking what has not been given, or straying from the path for pleasure's sake in your magic charms, works (deeds), or occupation.;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate lifestyle — Make a lifestyle out of identifying those elements of your personality that are contra-indicated, low, unskillful, un-Aristocratic, profitless, and dumping them;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate effort at self-control —<br /> Exercise Self-control. Make effort, exert energy to<br />
					1. Restrain low unskillful conditions that have arisen in the here and now<br />
					2. Refrain from low unskillful conditions that have not yet arisen<br />
					3. Obtain high, skillful conditions that have not yet arisen<br />
					4. Retain high, skillful conditions that have arisen;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate mind — Live, while you live<br />
					in a body,<br />
					in sensation,<br />
					in the heart, and<br />
					in the word,<br />
					understanding body,<br />
					sensation,<br />
					the heart and<br />
					the word,<br />
					seeing them as they really are,<br />
					seeing how they arise,<br />
					seeing how they end,<br />
					watchful and diligent,<br />
					(<i>Appamāda;</i> non-carelessness),<br />
					Satisfied,<br />
					reviewing and calming down,<br />
					overcoming any hunger and thirst that may appear,<br />
					releasing it all,<br />
					above it all,<br />
					downbound to nothing at all in the world.;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate serenity — Achieve a state with no objectives,<br />
					no indications of lust,<br />
					anger, or<br />
					blindness, and<br />
					empty of<br />
					lust,<br />
					anger, and<br />
					blindness,<br />
					whether walking, standing sill, sitting down, or lying down.;</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate vision — See that<br />
					Downbound blindness<br />
					rebounds bound up in own-making<br />
					That is: Blindness to the truth of consummate view<br />
					— or, in other words, blindness to the fact that
					Whatsoever has Come to Be
					is a Thing Destined to Come to an End —
					results in identified-with acts of body, speech and mind intended to create existence for the self — in other words: a personal world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Downbound own-making<br />
					rebounds bound up in re-knowing-knowing-knowledge.<br />
					Knowing the knowable as an individual;<br />
					self-consciousness, individualized consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Downbound re-knowing-knowing-knowledge<br />
					rebounds bound up in Named Form<br />
					"Phenomena" FaceName. The inter-operation of the individualized mind (called "name" because it distinguishes and identifies itself and other by an internal set of names) and matter (called "form" or "shape" or "appearance" or "entity" because it is whatever can be said to have become a "thing" in the world, including mental states, concepts, sounds, etc.)</p>

					<p class="f4">Downbound Named Form<br />
					rebounds bound up in re-knowing-knowing-knowledge<br />
					Individualized — own-made — confounded — consciousness is the factor on which the name/form phenomena depends, and name/form is the factor on which individualized consciousness, re-knowing-knowing-knowledge, depends.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is only in-so-far-as these three:<br />
					<b>[1]</b> re-knowing-knowing-knowledge (individualized consciousness),<br />
					<b>[2]</b> name and<br />
					<b>[3]</b> form<br />interact that there is that which is understood to be existence as a being in a state of being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Downbound re-knowing-knowing-knowledge
					rebounds bound up in the realm of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Downbound being bound up in the realm of the senses<br />
					rebounds bound up in contact<br />
					In the "realm" or "sphere" or "state" characterized by experience through contact through the six senses
					of the objects of those senses;<br />
					(being conscious of seeing sights, etc.)</p>

					<p class="f4">Downbound contact<br />
					rebounds bound up in sensation<br />
					The experience of pleasure, pain, or neither pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> nor pleasure<br />

					<p class="f4">Downbound being born
					rebounds bound up in</p>

					<p class="f4">Aging, Sickness and Death<br />
					Grief and Lamentation<br />
					Pain and Misery<br />
					and Despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">consummate detachment; — So seeing (High Vision), act accordingly.<br />
					Seeing the arising of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge and sense experience;<br />
					seeing the ending of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge and sense experience;<br />
					understanding that this seeing and all those mental states that came before are own-made,<br />
					made up of parts,<br />
					subject to breaking a-part,<br />
					ending,<br />
					resolve<br />
					(and do not just resolve, but actually do it)
					to let go of own-making mental states<br />
					and by that<br />
					attain the uttermost objective detachment possible,<br />
					and at that point,<br />
					seeing that this is being free,</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom recognize freedom, and</p>

					<p class="f4">Recognize that<br />

					<p class="f4">Recognize that<br />

					<p class="f4">Recognize that<br />
					there is no more this side or that, and</p>

					<p class="f4">Recognize that<br />
					there is no more being any kind of an "it"<br />
					at any place of "atness" left for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ethical practice of the Aristocrat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Together these constitute the four factors making up the accomplishment of Streamwinning-in-fact.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Honoring The Teacher<br />
					The One That Has Shown the Way</h4>

					<p class="f4">All that which is perceived through the senses has come to be and comes to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Locked into, identified with, perception through the senses, one is subject to, is not able to escape from, the coming to be and the destruction of all that which is perceived through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">A visible object coming into contact with the eye is perceived by the individual identifying with perception through the senses through the consciousness of it in the mind of the perceiver. There is no direct perception of the visible object there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, that is the same thing as saying: "Everything perceived is perceived as created by the self." There is no escape in Death. Rebirth is just the repetition of the same old problem. Endlessly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This results, for one who sees the danger of this, for one who is fed-up with this, is the desire to escape the coming to be of perception through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">The result of this is to see that faith in the <i>Dhamma, Saṇghā,</i> training, serenity, non-carelessness, and the willingness to give the method claimed by the Buddha to gain escape a shot is completely dependent on faith that this person has in fact found a way to escape identification with the coming to be of perception through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does one establish such faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">One begins with blind faith coupled with the working hypothesis that such a one did exist and correctly laid out the method for others who followed that path to achieve the same goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here that path is described as:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <i>Paṭisanthāra.</i> Translated by Hare as "Good Will"; by <i><i>bhikkhu</i></i> Bodhi (his <span class="f1">AN.7#70</span>) as hospitality. I would say, rather, that it was being willing to give this method a shot.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Being so willing one acts without carelessness in following the directions found in the method.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Being without carelessness one is undisturbed, that is, serene. In the serene state things are clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Being serene one does not rebel against details of the training and one becomes trained and sees for the self the advantages of being trained.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Seeing these advantages, one sees the various stages that will be reached by one who follows the method. This is seeing the <i>Saṇghā.</i> The importance of seeing the <i>Saṇghā</i> is that so seeing one sees that others who have followed this method will have arrived at various stages within it right up to attaining the goal of complete escape from sensory perception ever after.</p>

					<p class="f4">With this insight being a personal experience one is able to place confidence in the advantages in freedom of conformity with the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Following the method in this way one achieves the goal and in this achievement one no longer depends on trust in the fact that the Buddha has found a way to escape identification with the coming to be of perception through the senses and the destruction that follows. One has seen this as a matter of personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way one respects or honors the Consummately Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>A-dukkha-m-a-sukhā vedanā,</i> not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant experience, is not "neutral" feeling. This term is a name for the repercussion experienced by a wise person intending to escape <i>kamma.</i> When accompanied by blindness it results in the urge to experience pleasant sense-experience. When accompanied by wisdom it is a taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If this repercussion were some sort of sense-experience, there would be no escaping <i>kamma.</i> This is the experience of not experiencing sense-experience that is either painful or pleasant.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>Viññāṇā</i></h4>

					<p class="f4">I think we should be using the literal translation of this term: "Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge".</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness", the usual translation, is causing us great confusion because <i>"viññāṇā"</i> is used to describe both the state of sense-consciosness of the ordinary sense-bound individual and the state of the freed consciousness of the Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">See the article on <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xvi~n~naa_na">Viññāṇa</a> in PED. <b><i>Be careful! Some of this is intresting; some of it is simply misdirected and because of that misdirects.</i></b></p>

					<p class="f4">The careful reader will see my struggles to get this clear throughout the site. <i><i>bhikkhu</i>s</i> Thanissaro and Bodhi have also had problems with this term which they have handled each differently according to their thinking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sometimes "consciousness" will be used by me for both states; sometimes "consciousness" will be used only when describing the state of the Arahant and "sense-consciousness" will be being used for the ordinary person; sometimes "individualized-consciousness" will be used to describe the state of the ordinary person. None of these alternatives really reflect what is found in the <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If we used, instead, "re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" that could be used for both cases as <i>"viññāṇā"</i> is used in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and with this translation it would not be causing the confusion it is now causing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" means simply having knowledge of knowing <b>whatever</b> has arisen as a consequence of perception. (There is perception beyond sense-experience. See: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_11_ekadasakanipata.htm#p7">AN 11.7</a> and many others)</p>

					<p class="f4">If the perception is of named-forms, or the sense realms then it is re-knowing-knowledge of sense-experience; if the perception is of freedom from perception of named-forms or the sense realms then it is re-knowing-knowledge of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Saññā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blind to how that ends,<br />
					the arising of identification with the intent to get sense-experience through acts of body, speech and mind,<br />
					with the arising of such own-making,<br />
					the arising of named-forms<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of things experienced through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Saññā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">But if the perception is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is it!<br />
					This is the culmination!<br />
					That is, the calming of all own-making,<br />

					<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">the experience will be:</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived has been the best of lives!<br />
					Done is duty's doing!<br />
					No further is there this side or that.<br />
					No more being any kind of an "it"<br />
					at any place of "atness" for me."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">and the re-knowing-knowledge will be:</p>

					<p class="f4">Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge of<br />
					seeing that how that ends,<br />
					there is no arising of identification with the intent to get sense-experience through acts of body, speech and mind,<br />
					that when there is no arising of such own-making,<br />
					there is no arising of named-forms<br />
					that when there is no arising of named-forms,<br />

					there is no arising of aging, sickness, and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery, and<br />
					despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of freedom from things experienced through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is now little point in my making a change like this (in fact, if the difference is kept in mind, it might even be useful as the idea is understood as "consciousness" today anyway) so readers are advised to make the connection in their minds as they go along:  there is consciousness experienced through the senses and there is consciousness apart from the senses. That which is experienced through the senses is said to exist and to have been own-made and therefore comes to an end in pain. That which is apart from experience through the senses is not said to exist and has not been own-made and because of that does not come to and end or bring about the experience of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" was the translation first used here, I should have stuck with that, but peer pressure caused me to revert to "consciousness". It has been a confusing, debilitating, blind obstruction ever since.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The Cloying Nature of Food</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Cloying" appears quite often in the translations of the suttas and however 'ancient' it may be, is a perfect description of the problem food creates for the student of the <i>Dhamma.</i> One seeking to properly set up the mind should make himself conscious of the cloying nature of food. I think a definition is useful.</p>

					<p class="f4">To cloy is to create disgust by way of first creating thirst for enjoyment resulting in over-indulgence.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the OED: Possibly from to claw, or scratch.<br />
					The first six meanings relate to problems created by nails.<br />
					Meaning 7: To overload with food, so as to cause loathing, to surfeit or satiate (with over-feeding) or with richness, sweetness, or sameness of food);<br />
					8: To satiate, surfeit, gratify beyond desire; to  disgust, weary (with excess of anything.)</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Temporary Freedom</h4>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>Freedom from Things of Time<br />
					Every Once in a While</b></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The first term to understand in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p149">AN 5.149</a> is <i>'samaya,' sam</i> or <i>sa + m</i> = 'on' or 'with' aya: time, age, while. The 'Once upon a Time' or 'at one time' or 'once' of <i>Nidana's.</i> Temporal release; not temporary release; although the subject of the sutta is temporary release. Once in a while. The contemporary Indian English: 'Once in a way.' <i>vimutti</i> = freedom. The thing itself is having let go of some attachment, after the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms have passed off, reflecting on the bondage one had to a past habit one experiences a sense of freedom. This is often a matter of a profound sense of freedom accompanied by a 'sigh of relief.' If this is carefully examined, it is seen to be the whole process of attaining Arahantship in a nutshell.</p>

					<p class="f4">This careful examination includes, as well as a reflection on the things that lead to falling away from that state (delight in activity, gab, sleep and company, and, in the next sutta, <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/05_fives/an05.150.olds.bd.htm">AN 5.150,</a> not guarding the experiences at the senses and immoderate eating) not reflecting on the freedom of heart one has gained.</p>

					<p class="f4">That last is:  <i>"athā-vimuttaṃ cittaṃ na pacc'avekkhati."</i><br />
					My translation: "... he does not reflect on the freedom of heart he has attained."<br />
					Hare: "he does not look at the mind apart"<br />
					Which he footnotes: "... our Comy. 'just in momentary flashes' (<i>appit'appita-khaṇe, appeti</i> means both to fix and to rush on) 'with the depravities discarded, there is a state of release' ..."<br />
					<i><i>bhikkhu</i></i> Bodhi (not among the freely released suttas): "... he does not review the extent to which the mind is liberated." He gives this note: "Mp.: 'One who is liberated in mind through a mundane liberation, a tentative liberation, through the suppression of the defilements in absorption.'" (I object to the idea of 'suppression'. Suppression is the forcing down of a thing which requires continuous contact whereas what is involved here is separation. Mundane here is also not realistic, this is a major accomplishment, next door to <i>Nibbāna,</i> and is directly on the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">What has happened is that one has attained what is called "freedom from things of Time." This means freedom from any thing that has a beginning, middle, and end. It is temporary because  the freedom so attained is focused on this world or on one or another of the things of this world. The problem described here, not reflecting on the mind apart (Hare's translation focuses on an important way of seeing this), is solved, and lasting freedom attained when, in stead of focusing on some worldly object, one focuses in stead on the freedom attained. This is reflecting on the mind as a thing apart from the things of this world.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Unable to Arise Again in the Future</h4>

					<p class="f4">This is not the one-dimensional thing that is restraint. This is when one has gone up a level or more so that a bad thing is not even seen. "This indicates that such and such a bad thing would arise if going that way." For example, one is tempted to go down a certain street but one knows that going that way one will see the fairest lass of the land which will result in lust arising, so one does not go that way and one avoids the arising lust. With repeated practice and habit the not going that way becomes automatic and is unaccompanied even by trepidation. With more practice and a clearer picture of things as they really are, the lust will not arise even when confronted with such a stimulus because one's mind is on something else altogether. One or more steps removed. A thing which gives one time and distance from a bad situation eventually to the point where whatever the stimulus the distance between that and the arising of some bad state will always produce detachment.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Authenticity</h4>

					<p class="f4">If you do not understand rebirth, you do not really have a grasp of the point of Buddhism or the meaning of pain. If you understand these things then you can see that this business of authenticity has been used in these times as a way of not facing the work involved in bringing this system into your life. The whole of this research called "modern linguistic analysis", EBT (Early Buddhist Texts), "stratification", etc., is invalidated with the idea that a person, maybe hundreds or thousands of years after the Buddha's death might remember a saying that was not recorded in the sutta collections. Comparing sutta with sutta means that one is to take the <i>Dhamma,</i> the instructions or advice as to how to achieve <i>Nibbāna</i> or some other good state, or as to how to eliminate some bad state, and to compare that message and its construction with those suttas that are in the already-formed collection. What lines up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be accepted; what does not line up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be put to the side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not the Bodhi Mind</h4>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not an existing thing outside there waiting for you to attain it. This is something that is very difficult to see for the translators. Almost all of them (including Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi) have settled for this existing thing and that is making them, essentially, into Mahāyana Buddhists discovering or reaching a Bodhi Mind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> comes into being for the individual. It is conditioned by the following of the <i>Magga,</i> but it is not own-made <i>(saṇkhāraed).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Following the <i>Magga</i> is a path of not-doings. Not doing this or that, the thing that results is not-done, not <i>saṇkhāred.</i> Following the <i>Magga, Nibbāna</i> is <b>born,</b> but is not "made by the individual". [Edit: that is probably not a very good way to put that in that <i>Nibbāna</i> is said to be the "unborn". Better would be "Following the <i>Magga,</i> the <b>path</b> to <i>Nibbāna</i> is born." What is intended is not that <i>Nibbāna</i> comes into existence per the Buddha's definition of an existing thing ((see DN 15) consciousness of named form), but that the path to the unborn is now born in the individual.]</p>

					<p class="f4">In <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p57">AN 5.57,</a> a parallel construction is put this way but the  connection between "the path" and <i>Nibbāna:</i> is not made by the translators.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one often reflects on being subject to aging, sickness, death, separation from the loved, and being the owner of one's <i>kamma,</i> the path comes into existence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Thanissaro:</p>

					<p class="f4">When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated."</p>

					<p class="f4">E.M. Hare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And while he often contemplates this thing, the Way comes into being"</p>

					<p class="f4">Take birth. The path is generated. Comes into being. Not "is reached," "is discovered."</p>
