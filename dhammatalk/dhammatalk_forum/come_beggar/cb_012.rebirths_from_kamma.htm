					<h1>The Outcome in Rebirth<br />
					of<br />
					Three Ways of Making Kamma</h1>

					<p class="f4"><b>1. Made by Giving with a wise objective as the result.</b></p>

					<p>Active generosity, done poorly, done moderately well, done in a superior way; and always accompanied by a similar development of ethical conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>2. Made by Ethical Conduct with a wise objective as the result.</b></p>

					<p>Abstention from unskillful behavior (deeds causing harm to self or others); cultivation of self-control, done poorly, done moderately well, done in a superior way.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>3. Made by Developing Self-Awakening with a wise objective as the result.</b></p>

					<p>Developing the mind, Dhamma research, energy, enthusiasm, impassivity, serenity, and detachment, done poorly, done moderately well, done in a superior way.</p>

					<p>Depending on the degree of development #s 1 and 2, practiced together, result in rebirths from luckless human birth through rebirth among the gods with power over the creations of others. See: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#realms">A Map of the Mind,</a> for the Buddhist Cosmology.</p>

					<p>Generosity practiced by itself, though always productive of good results, does not necessarily affect birth. It can, for example, explain a bad man with good luck, or an animal, ghost, or daemon with powers or good luck.</p>

					<p>Rebirth in the company of Brahmā and above, and attainment of Nibbāna, all require developing the mind to one degree or another.</p>

					<p>Keep in mind that in Buddhist India the idea of 'superior' development of a thing was truly heroic in scope.</p>
