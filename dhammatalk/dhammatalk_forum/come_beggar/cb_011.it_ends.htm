					<h1>It Ends! It Ends!</h1>

						<p class="f4">Develop serenity and the appreciation of solitude, my friends —</p>

						<p class="f4">It is through developing serenity and the appreciation of solitude<br />
						that one comes to know things as they really are.</p>

						<p class="f4">What things?</p>

						<p class="f4">The arising in the appearance of self of form<br />
						and the ending of form;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of sense-experience,<br />
						and the ending of sense-experience;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of sense-perception,<br />
						and the ending of sense-perception,<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of own-making,<br />
						and the ending of own-making;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of sense-consciousness,<br />
						and the ending of sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Taking pleasure in form one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-experience one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-perception one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in own-making one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-consciousness one is tied down.</p>

						<p class="f4">Regarding forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness as self,<br />
						or the self as having forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness,<br />
						or forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness as having self,<br />
						or self as being in forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness,<br />
						upon the alteration and change of forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness there is experience anxiety and fear.</p>

						<p class="f4">Taking pleasure or experiencing anxiety and fear concerning forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness,<br />
						one obsesses about forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness,<br />
						forms intentions with regard to forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Obsession and forming intentions are the fuel that drives existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">The counterpart of existence is birth.</p>

						<p class="f4">The counterpart of birth is aging and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery,<br />
						and despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">This was the case in the past,<br />
						this will be the case in the future,<br />
						and this is the case in what we see arising in front of us as self right now.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is what one sees in the serenity of solitude.</p>

						<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">Forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness are unstable.</p>

						<p class="f4">Being tied down to,<br />
						taking pleasure in,<br />
						experiencing anxiety and fear concerning<br />
						that which is unstable is the experience of pain.</p>

						<p class="f4">That which is painful is not wanted,<br />
						experience of that which is not wanted is something that is not under one's control.</p>

						<p class="f4">Something that is not under one's control<br />
						is not reasonably to be seen as:</p>
						
						<p class="f4">"This is mine."<br />
						"I am this."<br />
						"This is my self."</p>

						<p class="f4">That on which forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness depend,<br />
						that which is the fuel which supports their existence,<br />
						the driving force of their existence,<br />
						is unstable, painful, and not-self.</p>

						<p class="f4">How could that which is dependent on,<br />
						fueled and supported by,<br />
						driven by,<br />
						the unstable, painful, and not-self<br />
						be stable, pleasant and self?</p>

						<p class="f4">Such a thing o b,<br />
						can no be.</p>

						<p class="f4">So seeing, one is repelled by forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Repelled, one is not tied down to forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness;<br />
						one does not experience anxiety and fear at the instability of forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Not taking pleasure or experiencing anxiety and fear concerning forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness,<br />
						one does not obsess about forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness,<br />
						one does not form intentions with regard to forms, sense-experiences, sense-perceptions, own-making and sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Not obsessing and forming intentions,<br />
						there is no fuel to drive existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">Without existence there is no birth.</p>

						<p class="f4">Without birth there is no aging and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery<br />
						and despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is what one sees in the serenity of solitude.</p>

						<p class="f4">Develop serenity and the appreciation of solitude, my friends —</p>

						<p class="f4">It is through developing serenity and the appreciation of solitude<br />
						that one comes to know things as they really are.</p>
