						<p class="f4">Develop serenity and<br />
						the appreciation of solitude,<br />
						my friends —</p>

						<p class="f4">It is through developing serenity and<br />
						the appreciation of solitude<br />
						that one comes to know things<br />
						as they really are.</p>

						<p class="f4">What things?</p>

						<p class="f4">The arising<br />
						in the appearance of self<br />
						of form and<br />
						the ending of form;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self<br />
						of sense-experience, and<br />
						the ending of sense-experience;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self<br />
						of sense-perception, and<br />
						the ending of sense-perception,<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self<br />
						of own-making, and<br />
						the ending of own-making;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self<br />
						of sense-consciousness, and<br />
						the ending of sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Taking pleasure in form<br />
						one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-experience<br />
						one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-perception<br />
						one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in own-making<br />
						one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-consciousness<br />
						one is tied down.</p>

						<p class="f4">Regarding forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness<br />
						as self, or<br />
						the self as having forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness, or<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness<br />
						as having self, or<br />
						self as being in forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness,<br />
						upon the alteration and change<br />
						of forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness<br />
						there is experienced<br />
						anxiety and fear.</p>

						<p class="f4">Taking pleasure or<br />
						experiencing<br />
						anxiety and fear<br />
						concerning forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness,<br />
						one obsesses about<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness,<br />
						forms intentions with regard to<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Obsession and<br />
						forming intentions<br />
						are the fuel<br />
						that drives existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">The counterpart of existence<br />
						is birth.</p>

						<p class="f4">The counterpart of birth<br />
						is aging and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery, and<br />
						despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">This was the case<br />
						in the past,<br />
						this will be the case<br />
						in the future, and<br />
						this is the case<br />
						in what we see<br />
						arising in front of us<br />
						as self<br />
						right now.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is what one sees<br />
						in the serenity<br />
						of solitude.</p>

						<p class="f4">Forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness<br />
						are unstable.</p>

						<p class="f4">Being tied down to,<br />
						taking pleasure in,<br />
						experiencing<br />
						anxiety and fear<br />
						concerning that which is unstable<br />
						is the experience of pain.</p>

						<p class="f4">That which is painful<br />
						is not wanted,<br />
						experience of that<br />
						which is not wanted<br />
						is something that is not<br />
						under one's control.</p>

						<p class="f4">Something that is not<br />
						under one's control<br />
						is not reasonably<br />
						to be seen as:</p>

						<p class="f4">"This is mine."<br />
						"I am this."<br />
						"This is my self."</p>

						<p class="f4">That on which<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness<br />
						depend,<br />
						that which is the fuel<br />
						which supports their existence,<br />
						the driving force<br />
						of their existence,<br />
						is unstable,<br />
						painful, and<br />
						not-self.</p>

						<p class="f4">How could that<br />
						which is dependent on,<br />
						fueled and<br />
						supported by,<br />
						driven by,<br />
						the unstable,<br />
						painful, and<br />
						not-self<br />
						be stable,<br />
						pleasant and<br />
						self?</p>

						<p class="f4">Such a thing,<br />
						o b,<br />
						can no be.</p>

						<p class="f4">So seeing,<br />
						one is repelled by<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Repelled,<br />
						one is not tied down to<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness;<br />
						one does not experience<br />
						anxiety and fear<br />
						at the instability of<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Not taking pleasure or<br />
						experiencing<br />
						anxiety and fear<br />
						concerning<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness,<br />
						one does not obsess about<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness,<br />
						one does not form intentions<br />
						with regard to<br />
						forms,<br />
						sense-experiences,<br />
						sense-perceptions,<br />
						own-making and<br />
						sense-consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Not obsessing and<br />
						forming intentions,<br />
						there is no fuel<br />
						to drive existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">Without existence<br />
						there is no birth.</p>

						<p class="f4">Without birth<br />
						there is no aging and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery and<br />
						despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is what one sees<br />

						of solitude.</p>

						<p class="f4">Develop serenity and<br />

						<p class="f4">It is through<br />
