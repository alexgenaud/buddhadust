					<h1>Seeing <i>Dhamma</i></h1>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, friends,<br />
					as of all the creatures<br />
					that roam the world<br />
					using feet,<br />
					the footprint of the elephant<br />
					is considered preeminent,<br />
					that is,<br />
					in terms of size;<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					of all the doctrines<br />
					describing the skillful mind,<br />
					the Four Aristocrats of Truths<br />
					are considered preeminent,<br />
					that is,<br />
					in terms of scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth that<br />
					'<i>This</i> is Pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth that<br />
					'The origin of Pain is Thirst.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth that<br />
					'The ending of Thirst is the Ending of Pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth that<br />
					'The walk to walk<br />
					to the ending of Pain<br />
					is the Aristocratic Multidimensional High Way,<br />
					that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">High Point of View;<br />
					High Principles;<br />
					High Talk;<br />
					High Works;<br />
					High Lifestyle;<br />
					High Self-control;<br />
					High Mind;<br />
					High Serenity;<br />
					High Seeing;<br />
					High Detachment.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, friends, is this 'pain'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is pain,<br />
					sickness is pain,<br />
					aging is pain,<br />
					death is pain,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery, and<br />
					despair<br />
					are pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not getting<br />
					what is wished for<br />
					is Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting<br />
					what is not wanted<br />
					is Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a word:<br />
					'These five support-compounds<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are Pain.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, friends,<br />
					is to be understood by<br />
					"In a word:<br />
					These five support-compounds are pain"?</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five<br />
					support compounds?</p>

					<p class="f4">The form support-compound;<br />
					the sense-experience<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> support-compound;<br />
					the perception support-compound;<br />
					the own-making<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> support-compound;<br />
					the consciousness support-compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these the form-support compound is made up of the four great properties:<br />
					solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion and<br />
					the forms that are compounded from these.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four can be either<br />
					relating to an individual or<br />
					be external and<br />
					in either case<br />
					they are unstable,<br />
					change, and<br />
					come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that which is<br />
					unstable and<br />
					changeable, and<br />
					that which is<br />
					compounded from<br />
					that which is<br />
					unstable and<br />
					changeable and<br />
					comes to an end<br />
					cannot sanely and<br />
					rationally<br />
					be understood as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This I am;<br />
					This is mine;<br />
					This is my 'self.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because<br />
					that which is not<br />
					under one's control<br />
					cannot<br />
					sanely and<br />
					rationally<br />
					be called<br />
					one's own or<br />
					to be said to<br />
					belong to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to hold<br />
					that a thing<br />
					that comes into being<br />
					by being derived from<br />
					that which is<br />
					unstable and<br />
					changeable and<br />
					which comes to an end<br />
					is the self<br />
					amounts to saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is myself<br />
					comes and goes,"<br />
					which is absurd.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the sane,<br />
					rational<br />
					individual<br />
					thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">That pain which has arisen<br />
					in that which I<br />
					erroneously<br />
					believed was myself<br />
					has arisen<br />
					as a result, or<br />
					repercussion<br />
					of something.</p>

					<p class="f4">A result of what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact of<br />
					 sense-organ with<br />
					sense-object and<br />
					consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">For example:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone says<br />
					something disagreeable<br />
					about him,<br />
					he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">This unpleasant experience<br />
					has come to me<br />
					through my sense of hearing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the result<br />
					of something,<br />
					it is not<br />
					not a result<br />
					of something.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what is it<br />
					the result?</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact of<br />
					that form<br />
					called sound and<br />
					that form<br />
					called ear<br />
					together with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-experience;<br />
					the perception;<br />
					the own-made aspect;<br />
					the consciousness of that form,<br />
					made up from solidity, liquidity, heat and motion<br />
					that is sense-organ and<br />
					sense-object consciousness —<br />
					all that is<br />
					unstable and<br />
					changeable and<br />
					comes to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">If being abused<br />
					he should become<br />
					angry and upset,<br />
					he should recollect<br />
					the parable<br />
					wherein the Buddha says<br />
					that even if downright bad guys<br />
					should cut him to pieces<br />
					with a saw,<br />
					were he to get angry<br />
					he would not be<br />
					following the Teacher's instructions.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body<br />
					is so constituted<br />
					that it is subject to abuse' and<br />
					he sets up recollection,<br />
					investigation,<br />
					energy,<br />
					enthusiasm,<br />
					impassivity,<br />
					serenity and<br />
					detachment<br />
					for the attaining of<br />
					freedom from body.</p>

					<p class="f4">By that focus<br />
					of his mind<br />
					on the component parts<br />
					on the made-up nature<br />
					of the experience,<br />
					on the task<br />
					of attaining freedom,<br />
					he is detached.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detached he is free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing this freedom<br />
					as freedom,<br />
					he sees the end of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that freedom<br />
					he can know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Left behind is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more is there being any sort of 'it'<br />
					at any place of 'at-ness' left for me."</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<hr class="hrctr" />

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a collection of<br />
					sticks and straw and mud<br />
					enclosing a space<br />
					were to be called<br />
					a house.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so the collecting,<br />
					assembling,<br />
					combining together of<br />
					form,<br />
					sense-experience,<br />
					perception,<br />
					own-making and<br />
					consciousness<br />
					in skin and bones,<br />
					flesh and blood,<br />
					piss and vinegar,<br />
					hot air and gas<br />
					enclosing a space<br />
					is called a living being.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friends,<br />
					a sense organ is functioning, and<br />
					an appropriate sense-object<br />
					comes within its range, and<br />
					there is contact<br />
					of the two<br />
					there arises<br />
					sense-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is form<br />
					in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a<br />
					'form-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is sense-experience<br />
					in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a<br />
					'sensation-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is perception<br />
					in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a<br />
					'perception-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is own-made<br />
					in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as an<br />
					'own-made-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is consciousness<br />
					in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a<br />
					'consciousness-supported-compound'.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way<br />
					it is to be understood that<br />
					within any given conscious experience<br />
					resulting from contact of<br />
					sense-organ with sense object<br />
					there is the collecting,<br />
					assembling,<br />
					combining together of<br />
					the support-compounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha said:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Whoever sees repercussive-self-arising<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							He sees <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever sees <i>Dhamma</i><br />
							He sees repercussive-self-arising."</p>

					<p class="f4">We have seen:</p>

					<p class="f4">The five support compounds<br />
					are repercussively-self-arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is<br />
					wishing for,<br />
					roosting upon,<br />
					inclination for,<br />
					being tied to<br />
					in these five support compounds,<br />
					that is<br />
					the arising of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is<br />
					the disciplining of<br />
					wishing and lust<br />
					among these five support compounds,<br />
					that is<br />
					the ending of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is<br />
					the walking of<br />
					the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional High Way,<br />
					is the walking of<br />
					the walk for<br />
					the disciplining of<br />
					wishing and lust<br />
					among these five support compounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how<br />
					"In a word:<br />
					'These five support-compounds<br />
					are pain'"<br />
					is to be seen.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />
