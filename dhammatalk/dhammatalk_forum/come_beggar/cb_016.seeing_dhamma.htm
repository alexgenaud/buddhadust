					<h1>Seeing Dhamma</h1>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, friends,<br />
					as of all the creatures that roam the world using feet,<br />
					the footprint of the elephant is considered pre-eminant,<br />
					that is, in terms of size;<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					of all the doctrines describing the skillful mind,<br />
					the Four Aristocrats of Truths are considered pre-eminant,<br />
					that is, in terms of scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth that '<i>This</i> is Pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth that 'The origin of Pain is Thirst.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth that 'The ending of Thirst is the Ending of Pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth that 'The walk to walk to the ending of Pain is the Aristocratic Multidimensional High Way, that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">High Point of View;<br />
					High Principles;<br />
					High Talk;<br />
					High Works;<br />
					High Lifestyle;<br />
					High Self-control;<br />
					High Mind;<br />
					High Serenity;<br />
					High Seeing;<br />
					High Detachment.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, friends, is this 'Pain'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is Pain,<br />
					Sickness is Pain,<br />
					Aging is Pain,<br />
					Death is Pain,<br />
					Grief and Lamentation,<br />
					Pain and Misery,<br />
					and Despair are Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not getting what is wished for is Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting what is not wanted is Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a word: 'These five support-compounds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> are Pain.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, friends, is to be understood by<br />
					"In a word: 'These five support-compounds are Pain'"?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five support compounds?</p>

					<p class="f4">The shape-support-compound;<br />
					the sense-experience<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> support-compound;<br />
					the perception support-compound;<br />
					the own-making<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> support-compound;<br />
					the consciousness support-compound.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these the shape-support compound is made up of the four great properties:<br />
					solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion<br />
					and the shapes that are compounded from these.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four can be either relating to an individual or be external<br />
					and in either case they are unstable,<br />
					change,<br />
					and come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that which is unstable and changeable,<br />
					and that which is compounded from<br />
					that which is unstable and changeable<br />
					and comes to an end<br />
					cannot sanely and rationally be understood as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This I am;<br />
					This is mine;<br />
					This is my 'self.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that which is not under one's control<br />
					cannot sanely and rationally be called one's own<br />
					or to be said to belong to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to hold that a thing<br />
					that comes into being by being derived from<br />
					that which is unstable and changeable<br />
					and which comes to an end<br />
					is the self<br />
					amounts to saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is myself<br />
					comes and goes,"<br />
					which is absurd.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the sane, rational individual thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">That Pain which has arisen<br />
					in that which I erroneously believed was myself<br />
					has arisen as a result,<br />
					or repercussion of something.</p>

					<p class="f4">A result of what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact of sense-organ with sense-object and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">For example:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone says something disagreeable about him, he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">This unpleasant experience has come to me through my sense of hearing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the result of something,<br />
					it is not not a result of something.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what is it the result?</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact of that shape called sound and that shape called ear together with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-experience;<br />
					the perception;<br />
					the own-made aspect;<br />
					the consciousness of that shape,<br />
					made up from solidity, liquidity, heat and motion<br />
					that is sense-organ and sense-object consciousness —<br />
					all that is unstable and changeable<br />
					and comes to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">If being abused he should become angry and upset,<br />
					he should recollect the Parable wherein the Buddha says that even if downright bad guys should cut him to pieces with a saw,<br />
					were he to get angry<br />
					he would not be following the Teacher's instructions.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body is so constituted that it is subject to abuse'<br />
					and he sets up recollection, investigation, energy, enthusiasm, impassivity, serenity and detachment<br />
					for the attaining of freedom from body.</p>

					<p class="f4">By that focus of his mind<br />
					on the component parts<br />
					on the made-up nature of the experience<br />
					on the task of attaining freedom,<br />
					he is detached.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detached he is free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing this freedom as freedom,<br />
					he sees the end of Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that freedom he can know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Left behind is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more is there being any sort of 'it'<br />
					at any place of 'at-ness' left for me."</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<hr class="hrctr" />

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a collection of sticks and straw and mud enclosing a space were to be called a house.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so the collecting, assembling, combining together of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness in skin and bones, flesh and blood, piss and vineger, hot air and gas enclosing a space is called a living being.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friends, a sense organ is functioning,<br />
					and an appropriate sense-object comes within it's range,<br />
					and there is contact of the two<br />
					there arises sense-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is shape in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a 'shape-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is sense-experience in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a 'sensation-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is perception in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a 'perception-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is own-made in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as an 'own-made-supported-compound';</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is consciousness in such that has thus come to be,<br />
					that is known as a 'consciousness-supported-compound'.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way it is to be understood that<br />
					within any given conscious experience<br />
					resulting from contact of sense-organ with sense object<br />
					there is the collecting, assembling, combining together of the support-compounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha said:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Whoever sees repercussive-self-arising<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							He sees Dhamma.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever sees Dhamma<br />
							He sees repercussive-self-arising."</p>

					<p class="f4">We have seen:</p>

					<p class="f4">The five support compounds are repercussively-self-arisen.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is wishing for, roosting upon, inclination for, being tied to<br />
					in these five support compounds,<br />
					that is the arising of Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the disciplining of wishing and lust among these five support compounds, that is the ending of Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the walking of the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional High Way,<br />
					is the walking of the walk for the disciplining of wishing and lust among these five support compounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how<br />
					"In a word: 'These five support-compounds are Pain'"<br />
					is to be seen.</p>
