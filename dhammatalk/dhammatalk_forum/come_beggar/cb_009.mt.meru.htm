						<h4 class="ctr">Mount Meru (Sumeru, Sineru)</h4>					  	

							<div class="inner">
								<p>DPPN: <b>Sineru.</b> A mountain, forming the centre of the world. It is submerged in the sea to a depth of eighty-four thousand <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#yojana">yojanas</a> and rises above the surface to the same height. It is surrounded by seven mountain ranges  — <i><b>Yugandhara, §sadhara, Karavīka, Sudassana, Nemindhara, Vinataka and Assakaṇṇa.</b></i> On the top of Sineru is <i><b>Tāvatiṃsa,</b></i> while at its foot is the <b>Asurabhavana</b> of ten thousand leagues; in the middle are the four <i><b>Mahādīpā</b></i> [great islands or lands or continents] with their two thousand smaller <i>dīpa.</i><br />
								Sineru is often used in similes, its chief characteristic being its unshakability <i>(suṭṭhuṭhapita).</i> It is also called <b>Meru</b> or <b>Sumeru, Hemameru</b>, and <b>Mahāneru.</b> Each <b>Cakkavāla</b> [world system] has its own Sineru, and a time comes when even Sineru is destroyed. </p>

						      <p class="in2"><sup>1</sup> Popularly rendered Caucasus (see Night cdxcvi): it corresponds so far with the Hindu "Udaya" that the sun rises behind it; and the "false dawn" is caused by a hole or gap. It is also the Persian Alborz, the Indian Meru (Sumeru), the Greek Olympus, and the Rhiphæn Range (Veliki Camenypoys) or great starry girdle of the world, etc.</p>

								<p>A vision attained by those who 'see', Mt. Meru is not a physical place in the ordinary world though it is a representation of a real perception from 'on high.'</p>
								
								<p>To toss something beyond Mt. Meru (Mt. Káf) is to cast it out of this world.</p>
