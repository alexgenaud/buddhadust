						<h4 class="ctr">Mount Meru (Sumeru, Sineru)</h4>

							<div class="inner">
								<p>DPPN: <b>Sineru.</b> A mountain, forming the center of the world. It is submerged in the sea to a depth of eighty-four thousand <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#yojana"><i>yojanas</i></a> and rises above the surface to the same height. It is surrounded by seven mountain ranges  — Yugandhara, Sadhara, Karavīka, Sudassana, Nemindhara, Vinataka and Assakaṇṇa. On the top of Sineru is Tāvatiṃsa, while at its foot is the Asura<i>-bhavana</i> of ten thousand leagues; in the middle are the four <i>Mahā-dīpā</i> [great islands or lands or continents] with their two thousand smaller <i>dīpa.</i><br />
								Sineru is often used in similes, its chief characteristic being its unshakability <i>(suṭṭhuṭhapita).</i> It is also called Meru or Sumeru, Hemameru, and Mahāneru. Each <i>Cakkavāla</i> [world system] has its own Sineru, and a time comes when even Sineru is destroyed. </p>

						      <p class="in2"><sup>1</sup> Popularly rendered Caucasus (see Night cdxcvi): it corresponds so far with the Hindu "Udaya" that the sun rises behind it; and the "false dawn" is caused by a hole or gap. It is also the Persian Alborz, the Indian Meru (Sumeru), the Greek Olympus, and the Rhiphæn Range (Veliki Camenypoys) or great starry girdle of the world, etc.</p>

								<p>A vision attained by those who 'see', Mt. Meru is not a physical place in the ordinary world though it is a representation of a real perception from 'on high.'</p>

								<p>To toss something beyond Mt. Meru (Mt. Káf) is to cast it out of this world.</p>
