							<h4 class="ctr">Kāma<br />
							Sense-Pleasures</h4>

							<p class="f4">When trying to determine what is meant by the Buddha when using the term <i>kāmā</i> one should picture not a single state or class of states, but a spectrum of classes of states from the own-making (sankhara-ing) born of the yearning of the deluded Pajapati for the companionship of other beings, to common experience of [caring about] enjoyment of the sensations produced at the senses, to sexual intercourse. Visualize these images as superimposed over one-another. (A = B = C) It's not Freud's 'everything is just sex' and it's not 'ultimately everything is Pajapati's problem'. It depends on where your mind is at present. Start there. It's from there that detachment is possible. To help cultivate the mind to detachment from wherever it is focused, the Master has concocted (cooked up; sankhara'd) a number of similes: Pleasures of the Senses are:</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like A Bone thrown to a Dog</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a dog,<br />
							overcome with hunger and thirst<br />
							who chances upon a slaughter-<i>house</i><br />
							and the cattle-butcher,<br />
							or his skillful apprentice,<br />
							tosses him a bone,<br />
							scraped,<br />
							much-scraped,<br />
							devoid of meat,<br />
							but with a shmere of blood.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">Could that dog,<br />
							gnawing that bone,<br />
							scraped,<br />
							much-scraped,<br />
							devoid of meat,<br />
							but with a smere of blood<br />
							find in that<br />
							the satisfaction of his hunger and thirst?</p>

							<p class="f4">Of course not.</p>

							<p class="f4">How come?</p>

							<p class="f4">Because he would wear himself out<br />
							before ever he got satisfaction from that bone<br />
							scraped,<br />
							much-scraped,<br />
							devoid of meat,<br />
							but with a smere of blood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like Carrion</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagin a Raptor<br />
							— a Condor or Eagle or Falcon or Hawk —<br />
							that has ripped off a piece of carrion<br />
							and flown off<br />
							and that other Raptors<br />
							— Condors or Eagles or Falcons or Hawks —<br />
							are circling round diving at that piece of meat<br />
							trying to grab a piece for themselves.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">If that Raptor<br />
							— that Condor or Eagle or Falcon or Hawk —<br />
							did not quickly let go of that piece of carrion,<br />
							would it not come to death,<br />
							or deady pain?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like Carrying a Torch against the Wind</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a man coming forth<br />
							carrying a flaming grass torch<br />
							against the wind.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">If that man did not quickly let go of that flaming grass torch<br />
							would it not burn his hand,<br />
							or burn his arm,<br />
							or burn another part of his body<br />
							and because of that<br />
							would he not come to death,<br />
							or deady pain?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like a Pit of Glowing Coals</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagin a pit of glowing coals,<br />
							deeper than a man is high<br />
							— coals neither flaming up nor smoking —<br />
							and here a certain person comes along,<br />
							loving life, not wishing death<br />
							wanting happiness, averse to pain<br />
							and two strapping men,<br />
							taking his arms<br />
							were to drag him off to that pit of glowing coals,<br />
							deeper than a man is high<br />
							— coals neither flaming up nor smoking.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">Would not that man<br />
							twist and turn his body<br />
							this way<br />
							and that thinking:</p>

							<p class="f4">'If I fall in<br />
							that pit of glowing coals<br />
							I will come to death,<br />
							or deady pain!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like a Dream</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine seeing beautiful parks,<br />
							and beautiful forests,<br />
							and beautiful plains,<br />
							and beautiful mountain ranges,<br />
							and beautiful lakes,<br />
							in a dream,<br />
							and then waking up<br />
							to find they have vanished.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like a Loan</b></p>

						<div class="floatlpp wpx63 mart6">
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/zoot-a-lore.jpg" width="63" height="142" alt="snappy" /></p>
						</div>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a man who has taken out a loan,<br />
							got himself rigged up with a new car,<br />
							right snappy duds,<br />
							rings, earrings, buttons and studs<br />
							aglitter with diamonds and rubies<br />
							and other precious gems,<br />
							gold and silver chains and medallions,<br />
							pockets stuffed with cash,<br />
							delighting in the admiration of the crowd<br />
							that thinks this is the way<br />
							a wealthy man struts his stuff.</p>

							<p class="f4">Then imagine that right there<br />
							the collector<br />
							or his skillful apprentice<br />
							comes along and repossesses the new car,<br />
							the new duds,<br />
							his jewels and his cash.</p>

							<p class="f4">Strips 'im right down to 'es boxers<br />
							right there in front of everyone.</p>

							<p class="f4">Then he has second thoughts ...<br />
							and takes the boxers too.</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think about that?</p>

							<p class="f4">Would that man's embarassment<br />
							convince him<br />
							that he had had enough of pretending?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like Being Up A Tree</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Imagine a fruit tree<br />
							growing in the dense forest<br />
							laden with ripe fruit<br />
							but with no fruit yet fallen to the ground,<br />
							and here comes a certain person<br />
							hungry and thirsty for fruit<br />
							looking around for fruit,<br />
							with a wanna, needa gotta hafta hava<br />
							piece<br />
							of fruit.</p>

							<p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

							<p class="f4">Although this fruit tree is laden with fruit,<br />
							no fruit has yet fallen to the ground.</p>

							<p class="f4">But I know how to climb a tree —<br />
							How about if I climb this tree<br />
							and eat as much as I want<br />
							and stuff my pockets for later?</p>

							<p class="f4">And that is just what he does.</p>

							<p class="f4">Then imagine that<br />
							a certain man with an axe<br />
							comes along<br />
							hungry and thirsty for fruit<br />
							looking around for fruit,<br />
							with a wanna, needa gotta hafta hava<br />
							piece<br />
							of fruit.</p>

							<p class="f4">And seeing that tree, thinks:</p>

							<p class="f4">Although this fruit tree is laden with fruit,<br />
							no fruit has yet fallen to the ground<br />
							and I do not know how to climb a tree —<br />
							How about if I chop down this tree<br />
							and eat as much as I want<br />
							and stuff my pockets for later?</p>

							<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

							<p class="f4">If that first man did not quickly climb down from that tree,<br />
							would he not come to death,<br />
							or deady pain?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4">In the same way as in these similes<br />
							Pleasures of the Senses<br />
							are of much grief and aggrivation at the time<br />
							and lead to real danger later.</p>

							<p class="f4">Seeing the meaning of these similes<br />
							as they really are<br />
							with consumate wisdom —<br />
							you avoid<br />
							whatsoever is that which is diversity-situated diversity detachment —<br />
							whatsoever is that which is unity-situated unity detachment —<br />
							and develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4">Diversity-situated diversity detachment is the detachment of an individual who is himself diverse in nature from that which is diverse in nature. What is diverse in nature is form, sensation, perception, own-making and individualized consciousness. Ordinary detachment: aka: Poise, equanimity, unflappability, detachment.</p>

							<p class="f4">Unity-situated unity detachment is the detachment of an individual who is himself unified in nature from that which is unified in nature. What is unified in nature is the four formless realms and the state of ending perception and sense-experience. Temporary Release. Delivery from things of Time.</p>

							<p class="f4">Detachment wherein all support for the world is completely desolved is Nibbāna, the unseen consciousness, deathlessness, being outside Time. This is called "Release from things Not of Time," and is an unshakable, permanent freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4">See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p29">MN.29</a>, discussion, and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p38">Mn.38.</a></p>

							<p class="f4">This is precisely the difference between 'equanimity' and 'detachment' and why 'detachment' is the better translation for <i>upekkhā.</i></p>

							<p class="f4">There can be a worldly sort of detachment (equanimity) but there cannot be an equanimity without worldly objects.</p>

							<p class="f4">Equanimity = Equal minded. Equal meaning towards either side of something. Something with two sides is not a unity. Balanced between two alternatives. You cannot be equal minded within unity.</p>

							<p class="f4">Go back to the Seven Dimensions of Self-Awakening: Put Memory in charge. After doing your Dhamma Research so that you have a basis in knowledge; develop energy and enthusiasm; then progress from equanimity to serenity to detachment = equal-minded within it, serenely above it, detached from it.</p>

							<p class="f4">So, in response to:</p>

							<p class="f4">[Bhk. Bodhi's edited version of Ñanamoli Thera's translation]:<br />
							Having avoided the the equanimity that is diversified,<br />
							based on diversity,<br />
						 	do not develop the equanimity that is unified,<br />
							based on unity —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">[Lord Chalmers]:<br />
							Having shed any equanimity<br />
							which is scattered and diffused<br />
							do not develop that real poise<br />
							which is one-centred and concentrated —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">[Bhk. Thanissaro]:<br />
							Having avoided the equanimity coming from multiplicity,<br />
							dependent on multiplicity,<br />
							do not develop the equanimity coming from singleness,<br />
							dependent on singleness —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">[Ms. Horner]:<br />
							Having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,<br />
							resting on multiformity,<br />
							do not develop that equanimity<br />
							which is equanimity in face of uniformity,<br />
							resting on uniformity,<br />
							ask yourself: 'What is "equanimity in the face of uniformity based on uniformity"'? and<br />
							how could there be an equanimity towards such without grasping?<br />
							and instead of following this advice —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">Go back to the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/mn/mn.001.olds.bd.htm#oneness">Mulapariyaya</a>: "He does not think about unity. He does not think: 'I am unity, unity is mine, I am of unity, unity is of me.'"</p>

							<p class="f4">This discourse has been about how,<br />
							in the discipline for an ariyan,<br />
							there is an entire giving up in every way<br />
							of all avocations;<br />
							about what makes up the plenitude of universal giving-up<br />
							according to the Law of the Noble;<br />
							about how the cutting off of affairs in the Noble One's Discipline is achieved entirely and in all ways.</p>

							<p class="f4">This discourse has not been about how to achieve a menatally balanced position in the world. That would be an avocation, an affair.</p>
