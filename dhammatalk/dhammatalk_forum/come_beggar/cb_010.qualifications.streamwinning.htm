					<p>The Buddha teaches that when a layman is able to identify in himself that he is free from the five sources of guilty dread in poor ethical behavior, when he has solid faith in the Buddha, <i>Dhamma</i> and <i>Saṅgha,</i> and when he has wised up to the aristocratic method, he may call himself a Streamwinner and assure himself that rebirth below human states is finished.</p>

						<h4 class="ctr">Qualifications for Stream-Entry<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn*" href="#n*">*</a>]</sup></span></h4>

						<p class="f4">With these things solidly established one is able to see and know for himself that he is a Streamwinner, incapable of falling back, destined for Awakening within seven lifetimes at the most, free hence-forth from rebirth in any state of misery lower than that of human beings.</p>

						<p class="f4"><b>Ethics of the Aristocrats:</b></p>

						<p class="f4">He abstains from taking life.</p>

						<p class="f4">He abstains from taking what is not given.</p>

						<p class="f4">He does not abandon his ethical standards in the pursuit of sense-pleasures.</p>

						<p class="f4">He abstains from saying that which he knows is not true.</p>

						<p class="f4">He abstains from indulgence in substances that result in careless behavior or sloth.</p>

						<p class="f4"><b>With Penetrating Wisdom, He knows and sees:</b></p>

						<p class="f4">All that which has come to be, must, of necessity, come to an end."</p>

						<p class="f4">All own-made things are impermanent.</p>

						<p class="f4">All own-made things are essentially painful.</p>

						<p class="f4">All things are not-self.</p>

						<p class="f4">This being, that comes to be;<br />
						this not being, that does not come to be;<br />
						from the arising of this, that arises;<br />
						from the ceasing of this, that ceases.</p>

						<p class="f4">Namely:</p>

						<p class="f4">Tied down to blindness, own-making comes to be;<br />
						tied down to own-making, consciousness comes to be;<br />
						tied down to consciousness, name-and-form come to be;<br />
						tied down to name-and-form, the six sense realms come to be;<br />
						tied down to the six sense-realms, contact comes to be;<br />
						tied down to contact, sense experience comes to be;<br />
						tied down to sense-experience, hunger/thirst comes to be;<br />
						tied down to hunger/thirst, supporting fuel for existence comes to be;<br />
						tied down to supporting fuel for existence, existence comes to be;<br />
						tied down to existence, birth comes to be;<br />
						tied down to birth, Old Age, Sickness, and Death,<br />
						Grief and Lamentation,<br />
						Pain and Misery,<br />
						and Despair all come to be.</p>

						<p class="f4">But:</p>

						<p class="f4">From the complete disappearance of blindness, own-making ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of own-making, consciousness ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of consciousness, name-and-form cease;<br />
						from the disappearance of name-and-form, the six sense realms cease;<br />
						from the disappearance of the six sense realms, contact ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of contact, sense experience ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of sense-experience, hunger/thirst ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of hunger/thirst, supporting fuel for existence ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of supporting fuel for existence, existence ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of existence, birth ceases;<br />
						from the disappearance of birth, Old Age, Sickness, and Death,<br />
						Grief and Lamentation,<br />
						Pain and Misery,<br />
						and Despair all cease to be.</p>

						<p class="f4"><b>He knows for a certainty:</b></p>

						<p class="f4">This Buddha was supremely awakened, an arahant, possessed wisdom and consummate behavior<br />
						walked the walk well,<br />
						knew this world and the next,<br />
						and taught this <i>Dhamma</i> the way it should be taught.</p>

						<p class="f4">This <i>Dhamma</i> is a saving <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
						capable of being seen and understood in this visible world,<br />
						with immediate results, not a matter of awaiting some future destiny,<br />
						inviting examination,<br />
						comprehensible for himself by an intelligent person.</p>

						<p class="f4">The Order of Disciples, that is to say: The Stream-winner, the Once Returner, the Non-Returner and the Arahant, and those that are striving after becoming such, are on the right track, walking the straight path, following proper form within the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n*" href="#fn*">*</a>]</sup> These qualifications are for what I call 'Stream-entry Proper'; there are several different types of Stream-entry. See <a href="cb_021.a_course_on_stream-entry.htm#types1">here</a> and <a href="cb_021.a_course_on_stream-entry.htm#types2">here.</a> The common ground between them is the conviction that the Buddha has found a way to end pain.</p>
