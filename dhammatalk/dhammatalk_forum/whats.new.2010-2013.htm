					<p class="f4">Much of what this woman has to say is simply a projection of her pre-conceived notions of what 'ought' in her mind, to be the way of a great teacher. She does not speak from a mind informed by practice, she does not argue from established fact but from assumption, and she does not hesitate to heap scorn with the astounding arrogance of the academic on those who would believe differently than herself. She ends up aserting a doctrine which is some sort of mish-mash of her own devising. It is a marvel of the suttas themselves, and the basic honest effort she brings to her work, that her views do not intrude much or very harmfully on her translations but are confined to her introductions to books and suttas. For the historical interest and for the sake of allowing voice to the other side (and because there was a reference to her discussion of the translatin of the term <i>'bhikkhu'</i> in the Introductory Notes to K.S. 4 in Woodward's <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.001.wood.pts.htm#fn1">SN 5.45.1</a>) it is reasonable that they are posted on this site. The reader should be cautioned that this posting does not represent an endorsement of her views and he should read them carefully with a critical mind) ... here is an example:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx250 marl6">
							<p>In numerous places throughout this site will be found  explained the view that the repetitions were an original and vital feature of the suttas.<br />
							What people who have never tried it can overlook is that it is extremely difficult to repeat a formula again and again without making an error. And that is not to speak of the fact that there <i>is</i> variation within the regularity, something that is orders of magnitude harder to manage than straight repetition. The focus needed for such an effort is, or should be, just as, no! even more inspiring than variation for variation's sake to "a man of originality, of power, of winning charm." <i>That</i> is a demonstration of enormous mental power. Mrs. Rhys Davids asks for originality in the form of variation and then overlooks the fact that this <i>Dhamma,</i> stripped down to its essentials, is a matter of a few paragraphs. These 'repetitive' suttas are the variations! The unique ways the same basic information is conveyed over and over in an age without the printing press or ... internet or cellphone. This has been said before here: these suttas are like mental gymnastic routines. They should be received in the same spirit as one would watch the gymnastics at the Olympics. We, of course do not get much of the 'style' that we would no doubt appreciate in a live performance, the smooth delivery, the lack of hesitation, the pauses, the ques as to humor, etc. but at least we can set the scripts into print with the grace of form they come with.</p>

						</div>

							<p class="f3 in2">"But nothing will convince me that we have, in that stereotyped argument about <i>Attā,</i> the very way in which Gotama fed his questioners over and over again. That is indeed unthinkable. He may conceivably in his long ministry have sanctioned his disciples' drawing up a fixed wording here and there. But as a man of originality, of power, of winning charm, he would be simply unable to repeat himself. It is the way of such elect souls to react with fine sensitiveness to every fresh conjuncture calling for speech. It is the way of such elect souls to be welling up and overflowing in creative will now thus and now thus. Not his the formula of the Suttas any more than was his the terse cryptic gnome of the Sūtras."<br />
							Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids</p>

					<p class="f4">The contrary view is that it is testimony to the clarity of Gotama's original awakening that his doctrine could be stated in terms not needing alteration even down to the syllable (give or take) through the course of 40 years of teaching. We see throughout the collection that disciples used the same phraseology and here and there this phenomenon is actually remarked upon with pride.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is an interesting phenomena that in so many cases down through history and right up to this day that a slight acquaintance with the <i>Dhamma</i> has inspired so many to think that they understand it all. This appears to come from two aspects of the situation. On the one hand Gotama so constructed his teachings as to be universal and timeless. That means that they used very low-level terms related to broad-based experiences (such as farming and hunting and sex and food). Conversely he avoided abstractions. The result is that much of what he said is immediately comprehensible across cultures, mental states, and time, and because it is by its nature good and and universally accepted by the wise (giving is good, ethical behavior is good, self-control is good, development of the mind is good), accepted as truth. On the other hand, having understood and accepted this much one naturally believes one is on firm ground in stating one has understood the system and that one's fundamental point of view concerning existence and non-existence is not challenged. The thinking of the reader will not initially be focused at the same ground-level, non-abstract word use as is used by Gotama and there will be a tendency to 'translate' what one is reading into the abstract terms one is used to using. These abstract terms will tend to confirm one's fundamental beliefs. The result is that when doctrine within the suttas that does run counter to one's fundamental beliefs is met with and cannot be translated away, it appears to run against the grain of the 'truth' in the <i>Dhamma</i> that one has initially accepted. The error must be in the document, not in one's self! After all, it is beyond question that one has understood such a clearly put teaching. "The teacher of such a clearly put teaching would never have said <i>that.</i> How do I know? Because I am one who understands the system." Round and round.</p>

					The Buddha describes the idea that lust, hate and stupidity tend to proliferate and end in unhappy births whereas their opposites tend to breed further good <i>kamma</i> which ends in a happy rebirth. This is a little, apparently simple, sutta which could easily be overlooked, but which has within it the kernal of one of the most important phenomena dealt with by Gotama's system: that is, that we tend to do what we remember having done. When hungar arises we recall that last time hunger arose we satisfied it with a big meal from the Greasy Spoon (we omit to remember <i>-moha,</i> stupidity- the indigestion that followed later that night), the pleasant sensations of the memory urge the decision <i>-lobha-</i> to get such food once again, and once again we experience indigestion (and quickly supress the memory after; <i>-dosa,</i> hate-). Had we exercised memory <i>-sati-</i> of the unpleasant result (or taken note of this sutta!), we could have dealt with the hunger with moderation and on later reflection enjoyed the fact that we had satisfied the needs of the body while at the same time we had freed ourself from the repitition of an unpleasantness. Pushed out, this is the same mechanism used in the process of finding rebirth.<br />

Both were declared to have been reborn in the Tusita realm as Once-returners by the Buddha. Her father was proficient in ethical conduct but deficient in wisdom, her uncle proficient in wisdom but deficient in ethical behavior, but Migasālā only sees one side: that her father was proficient in ethical behavior and her uncle was not; and she proceds to judge the Buddha and the <i>Dhamma</i> as flawed. Gotama explains the issue to Ānanda and gives three similar cases (which are different than those given in the version in the Tens).<br />

					Four things which conduce to the growth of wisdom and which are beneficial for one who has become human. This sutta is divided into two suttas in some versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> and understood to be two suttas by Bhk. Bodhi. On the surface making them into two suttas seems logical as, although the content of both halfs is identical, the point is directed at two different sorts of persons. There is another way to read this which is that the four helpful things can be understood at two different levels. One applied to the <i>bhikkhus,</i> and one applied to all 'beings who have become human' (where the possibility exists that there is no fully awakened one to follow and no <i>Dhamma,</i> capital 'D'.) In this latter case combining the two would serve to emphasize the double meanings.</p>

					Portrays ancient India, during the period of Buddhist ascendancy, from the non-Brahmin point of view. Based on the literary, numismatic and inscriptional records, it throws light on points hitherto dark and even unsuspected [then c. 1903]. Divided into sixteen chapters, the work presents a detailed account of the socio-economic, geo-political and ethico-religious conditions of the country. There are numerous illustrations of very bad quality as the edition used for scanning here was a photo reproduction from another book, done on poor thin paper causing see-through problems. Some of them amount to not much more than place-holders, but it was thought to be better to include something rather than nothing. Still, some interesting detail can be made out. Has anything of the same nature been done more recently? [Edit: scans of the images were replaced with better ones from another edition of the book.]<br />

					Much of the material in the appendix here called <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm">"Buddha's India"</a> was taken from this book.<br />
					This digital edition and reformatting was partially adapted from someone else's digital edition and reformatting that was in process a while back.

In a very interesting post-script to the direct answer that it is as a consequence of lust, hatred, delusion, not noticing the beginnings of things, and following wrong views and the reverse of these five, he further states that without these ten things there would be no wrong or deviant living or right or straight living. In other words these things amount to the sum total of what is needed to be done in the system to attain its goals. No mention of the <i>Magga.</i> In other other words, the <i>Magga</i> is a method for eliminating the first five of these things, so instruction can be given in these two general ways: either by stating the things to be eliminated or by stating the method to eliminate them.

(ending as with the two prevous suttas). It is interesting that here he is speaking of a person who has faith, virtue, much knowledge, the habit of casting off things, wisdom and quick wits.

					The Buddha reveals ten perceptions which are very helpful to seekers. I did a translation of this sutta so that we would have here a contrast with Woodward's translation. There is an enormous difference when <i>'sannā'</i> is translated 'perception' rather than 'idea'. <i>Sannā</i> = 'one-knowing' or 'first-knowing' or 'once-knowing' = perception, not idea. The difference is that an idea is an abstract thing, tending to suggest an intellectual understanding apart from the perception of it being something connected to the self (speaking conventionally, or, rather, since these things are 'helps along the way', speaking with regard to the identification with 'this being'); here the idea is to have actually seen these things as they manifest themselves to one's self ... actually seeing, or smelling, or tasting the identical repulsion one has of excrementia, in some otherwise delightful food for example, or the actual feeling of world-wearyness when some ambition arises, or the conscious recognition of release (a deep sigh of relief that feels like it is the first full breath one has had in a long time ... which it is) when one has finally passed the withdrawl stage connected with some habitual practice one has let go.<br />

					This sutta while including some of the perceptions from the previous sutta, adds a few that are in need of a little explanation. Perception of bones, larva, mal-coloration, swelling. These ideas are generally associated in the commentaries with the use of concentration devices (specifically those of observing a corpse). That has the tendency to create the same distance from them as does the use of 'idea' in the translation. These are 'live' perceptions. One sees in one's mind's eye, as clearly as in a vivid dream, maggots heaving around, as often as not within 'one's own' or some live person's body, or one sees all mankind as a mess of maggots roiling around in some open wound, not just in the body of a corpse one is using as a concentration device. One sees a repulsive swelling or bruising in ordinary objects and people, or one sees ordinary objects and people as just a repulsive swelling. Again, in the mind's eye, one perceives this whole universe as a disgusting skeleton, or one sees right into the bones of some person or sees some person as simply a walking skeleton. Woodward does not comment, Bhk. Bodhi has these as perceptions of corpses. The <i>Pāḷi</i> has these as stand-alone concepts; not connected to corpses. The distinction points out the utility: the <i>kasina</i> (observing a corpse) is used to stimulate the perception. The end result is not the perception of these things in a corpse, but the application of the perception of these things to everyday experience, they serve to make one aware on a gut level of the reality of things. One uses the recollection of these perceptions to counter lust or other disadvantageous feelings that have arisen. They instill sobriety.<br />

					Linked to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and to Bhk. Thanissaro, and Olds translations.<br />
					The Buddha teaches ten important ideas by posing them as questions that might be asked of <i>bhikkhus</i> (or any Buddhist) by outsiders. There is an interesting manipulation of the term <i>'dhamma'</i> here which illustates its dual meaning as 'thing' and 'Form' (in the sense of 'Good Form') or 'The Teaching.' (This translation of <i>'Dhamma'</i> as 'Good Form' comes from the discussion of the term in Rhys David's <a href="../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.015.asoka.htm#pg292">Buddhist India pg 292</a> where he points to the etymological root as "identical with the Latin <i>forma</i>" our 'form'. This serves very well for this word where it must stand for 'thing' and is a synonym for <i>'rūpa'</i> (often translated 'form') in this sense, and also for 'the best way to do a thing', or 'Good Form'. This use for 'form' is found in asian cultures where the idea is exactly that there is a perfectly correct and efficient way to do even the smallest things. The expression 'Doing Forms' is also used as the English translation for the term in asian martial arts that stands for various groups of moves in practice routines. At this time the word <i>'Dhamma'</i> for Gotama's teaching is relatively well known here and it will probably stick, but there is confusion that results when the word must be used for 'things' and ... 'Good form' in general.)<br />

					A beautiful sutta once unabridged. In the technique of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> the Buddha traces out how blindness rolls on and the way freedom from it is managed. The distinction in the terms used here from those used in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>  should be enlightening. The term for the relationship between a thing and its result is 'food'. This is the food of that. The significant difference between the idea of 'food' and the idea of 'cause' should be kept in mind when thinking about the meaning of this sutta and the translation of terms such as <i>'paccaya'.</i><br />

					Almost identical with the previous sutta, but beginning with thirst for existence (Woodward's 'craving-to-become').<br />
					Together these bracket the first condition of the  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> : <i>Avijjā paccayo saṅkhārā.</i> [see for example <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.001.pali.bd.htm#p1.3">SN2.12.001</a>] Blindness (Woodward's 'Ignorance') results in own-making. On one side it answers the question: 'then what is it that results in blindness?' And on the other side it answers the question as to why blindness results in own-making.<br />
					Another thing is that since <i>'taṇhā,'</i> thirst, (Woodward's 'craving'), results in the usual first condition of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> 'blindness', and is also a 'condition' following sense experience within the formula, we can see by this that the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> is to be taken as a series of what Bhk. Thanissaro has called 'feedback loops' and should not be taken exclusively as a direct-line analysis. An interesting comparison could be made to the Mandelbrot Set, where, at any point along a series a new series could be begun, and so on without end.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.063.wood.pts.htm">The Goal</a> Woodward translation<br />
					Gotama states that all those who attain the goal are possessed of or are certain about 'view'; some of those reaching the goal here in the human state and some of them reaching the goal after 'departure'. 'View' here would be the '<i>dhamma</i> eye': "all things that have come into existence are destined to come to an end," or one form or another of the Four Truths.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.064.wood.pts.htm">Unwavering</a> Woodward translation<br />
					Almost identical to the previous sutta except that here Gotama asserts that all those who have unwavering faith in him are Streamwinners. Something to consider for those insisting that there can be no stream-entry without breaking <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#FundamentalAttachments">the first three saṇyojanas.</a> The catch is of course the 'unwavering' part. It is an easy thing to say one has unwavering faith in something when one has studied it for years or decades or practiced it a little with good results, but this is a wide world and the mind is organized in hierarchies and unless the person has crossed the line marked by the '<i>dhamma</i> eye': "<i><b>all things</b></i> that have come into existence are destined to come to an end" aka, breaking of the one-truth (true self) view also called by me <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's Problem,</a> the mind which had latched onto faith through fear (not a high level in the hierarchy) could find a greater satisfaction in someone dying on the cross for their sins, for example, or in the idea that there was no self, or in the idea that this was a one-shot thing and there was no possibility of having to pay up, than in concepts such as compassion, giving or ethical behavior ... themselves not high up in the pecking order. In fact, faith based on such things is one of the three things that the usual definition of the streamwinner suggests must be broken. Still the possibility exists that a person with no more than a faith that the Buddha taught a way to freedom, or a way to the end of pain, might tenaceously hold on to that faith at death and that tenacious hanging on could drag them into a rebirth where their faith could find growth and develop into knowledge and vision, so it is a true statement to say it can be done by faith alone.<br />
					One more thing: there was a point not too far back where many of those of us who had faith in Gotama's teaching were trying to make the idea of faith sound palatable to a population heartily disenchanted with a faith that depended on faith that had proved incapable of inspiring its leaders to remain on the path of righteousness, so to speak. There was a big effort to convince everyone that faith in Buddhism was not faith, but 'confidence' [e.g. Bhk. Bodhi in his translation of this sutta] or 'conviction' [Bhk. Thanissaro] or 'trust' or 'well-reasoned or grounded trust' [me], but here the plain fact of the case is that this sutta is speaking about blind faith and I think we need to accept the fact that there is this level of trust, conviction and confidence in Gotama and his system as well and that it is not without good results. There are those of us who would like to think of Gotama's system as mathematically pure science, which it is, but we need also to recognze that there are those who have blind faith even in pure mathematics, and that it is not therefore a danger to the system that there are such believers. ... its when a person has confidence and conviction that their blind faith is well grounded and starts proselytizing that the trouble starts, but that is another story.<br />

These lists are very valuable as they pop into the mind at those times when one is about to cross a line and can give one just enough detachment (self-reflection) to correct course. The secret is in their broad-based generality. Note that these are called 'groundless' (<i>a-ṭ-ṭhane</i> without standing) reasons for aggrivation. Why is that? Because anger is never a well-grounded response to an unpleasant situation because it only engenders more anger followed by unpleasant deeds carrying further unpleasant consequences.

					Our version of the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> was incomplete for this and the previous sutta. This may have been corrected, but readers of that version should check. The Buddha suggests ten thoughts as counter-weights to the arising of anger possible from ten situations where anger might arise (those of the previous sutta).  Woodward and Bhks. Thanissaro and Bodhi have trouble with the phrase: <i>taṃ kut'ettha labbhā' ti?</i> 'What is to be gained from that?' The meaning is understood if <i>kamma</i> is kept in mind. The idea is to calm one's tendency to an angry reaction by remembering that this deed this fellow does will return to him and that therefore there is no need to seek vengence from a feeling of outrage at injustice.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.089.wood.pts.htm">The Kokālikan</a> Woodward translation<br />
					A well-known sutta describing the horrific result of hardening his heart against Sāriputta and Moggalāna by the Kokālikan Monk. This sutta has in it the mention of a <i>'pacceka-brahmā.'</i> Bhk. Bodhi, in a footnote, cites Spk-pṭ I 213 (VRI ed) commenting on <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.06.010.rhyc.pts.htm">SN I 146,</a> as explaining this as "a Brahmā who travels about alone, not as a member of an assembly". This possibly throws some light on the term <i>'pacceka-buddha'</i> which is usually translated 'silent-buddha' or as Woodward has translated it here for the Brahmā, 'Individual-'. I have always felt this term, when applied to a Buddha, meant an individual who attained Arahantship without the aid of another awakened individual but who had not the training or charisma or inclination or opportunity to lead a following. There is also here another visit to Gotama by Brahmā Sahampati.<br />
					One other interesting thing in this sutta is the case of a non-returner returning to this world for a visit. We need, in thinking of the non-returner in order not to make the mistake made by Kokalika, to think in terms of rebirth, not freedom of movement.

					Mark Twain used to do a routine where he would stand in front of his audience and tell a feeble, possibly even tedious joke or story. When he got no reaction from the audience except embarrassment, he told the story again without altering a word or changing an inflection. He would repeat this routine as many times as necessary to bring the house down with laughter. It never failed.<br />
					My father used to tell the story of a comedian who would enter a bare stage with only a wooden chair on it, sit on the chair, and do nothing more until bit by bit there would be a snicker from someone in the audience, or a smile, and before long this non-act would bring the house down with laughter. It never failed.<br />
					There is something about repetition (or its alter-ego, nothing at all happening, as with the experience of those who seek solitude) that, if endured to a certain point (passed a murkey sloth), forces the mind into an elevated state, wakes it up to a grander scope.<br />
					It is just this sort of psychology that is being used by Gotama in the case of this and so many other suttas considered 'tedious' by translators and readers today [Wednesday, December 18, 2013 10:07 AM]. The reader may be given some slack. The written word carries little or none of the magic of a live performance. But the reader must accept his disadvantage and make up for it with imagination. Dwell on such a sutta as this. Place yourself in the situation as you imagine it happening at the time. It will come to life. It never fails.<br />
					Something important for translators to remember in this regard is to not yield to the impulse to change the wording for variety. Follow the <i>Pāḷi.</i> The <i>Pāḷi</i> is mathematically consistent, and this is a necessity for the mind to keep track of the variations in the pattern. Inserting difference to break tedium destroys the pattern in exactly the same way as if when weaving a rug one were to alter the pattern simply because it was the same all round. Translators may think they are helping the reader, but they are breaking the spell and this is all the greater crime because it is not suspected that there is a spell there that is being broken and the changes make it much more difficult to discover. This is just as much the case in the case of the whole body of suttas, but is very difficult and has not been managed to this point by any translator. A uniform translation vocabulary across all the suttas should be made the goal of the next generation of <i>Dhamma</i> translators.<br />

					Linked to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and Bhk. Thanissaro translation. Gotama explains to <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> how one may know with certainty that one is a Streamwinner and that one has passed beyond the reach of certain unpleasant forms of rebirth and is assured of eventual awakening. The careful reader can see in this sutta how development of ethical behavior leads to unwavering faith in the Buddha, <i>Dhamma</i> and the <i>Saṅgha</i> which leads to insight into the method.<br />
					The term translated 'Guilty Dread' by woodward and 'fear and animosity' by Bhk. Thanissaro and 'perils and emnities' by Bhk. Bodhi is <i>bhayāni verāni. bhayāni</i> = fear, fright, dread; <i>verāni</i> = hatred, revenge, hostile action. A possible better translation is 'fear of retribution', which is what makes up guilty dread and is the peril of emnity and the fear of animosity. These actions are perils and do produce emnities and fear and animosity both in the doer and in others, but the issue in this sutta is a condition for knowing that one is a streamwinner and that condition is the absense of or allaying of <i>bhayāni verāni.</i> within. It has nothing to do with what may result externally from these actions.<br />
					This is a good sutta to contrast with <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.064.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.64</a> where faith alone is being spoken of as a condition for stream-entry. It should be noted here that in both cases there is no mention of breaking the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>saṇyojana.</i></a> That is not to say they are not broken, but only to point out that the formal terminology is not used and because of that there is the possibility of flexible understanding of the conditions. Possessing the four limbs of Stream-winning would be the breaking of doubt and wavering <i>(vicikiccha);</i> true insight into 'the method' would be the breaking of the 'one truth view' <i>(sakkāya-diṭṭhi</i> (usually translated in terms meaning 'own-self-view': 'Person-pack-view' 'views on individuality' etc., my translation, points to the idea that it is getting rid of holding any view concerning the existence of anything that is the necessary meaning in that holding on to a view concerning the existence of anything is a projection of the idea of self, but perhaps that is going farther than is necessary, or even confusing the issue) <i>and</i> attachment to the view that the goal was reachable through giving, ethical conduct, or rituals <i>(sīl'abbata-parāmāso).</i> One can imagine (or experience) a situation where one or some or all of these conditions are only partially met here, but where with faith in the <i>Dhamma,</i> or in the idea that Gotama achieved Awakening, or in the idea that there were those who had advanced towards the goal, upon death or upon the subsequent rebirth they come to fulfillment. That person would by that faith and partial accomplishment reasonably be called a stream-winner. On the other hand, that person would not be able to state with absolute conviction, that he was a stream-winner. Hopefully reflecting on this sutta would, in that case, inspire greater effort.<br />

					Linked to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and Bhk. Thanissaro translation.<br />
					Uttiya the wanderer asks Gotama what he says about ten well-known questions concerning existence and non-existence each of which is answered by the statement by the Buddha that he has not made a declaration concerning the truth of that issue. Two additional question are: What then do you teach? and Will everyone be saved by this teaching?<br />
					The ten questions are the ones made famous by those who say that Gotama did not answer certain questions. That statement is a careless reading and mistaken. Here we see Gotama has not not answered the questions, he has answered by saying that he has not made an assertion of the truth or falsity of the proposition. This is not the same thing as not answering. If pressed for his reason for not making a declaration, (which Uttiya does not do in this sutta) Gotama explains that such questions are all based on points of view and consequently are true under only some ways of looking at things, false under others. Consequently if asked the simple question 'is this true?' there is no possible answer but that no one-sided declaration can be made about such an issue. Since with regard to the ten questions Gotama is being asked directly (that is, he is not being asked at this point what he has to say in general about this point of view) and only about his opinion as to the truth or falsity of the view, his only possible truthful answer is that he has not made a declaration (one way or the other) on that issue. When Uttiya askes about what Gotama does teach, he gets the other answer supplied to those who ask such questions: what he teaches, avoiding issues of existence and non-existence, is Pain, the origin of Pain, the ending of pain and the way to the ending of pain. (Stated in different terms in this sutta ... which is a notable fact in itself: no mention of the four truths or the eightfold way.)<br />
					This may look like nit picking, but it is of vital concern as it is a pivotal point for the mind. (It also demonstrates how the awakened mind listens to and responds to questions!) Comprehension of why these are not fruitful inquiries leads to comprehension of the middle way and how it solves the problem of the pain associated with existence.<br />
					For translators also it is vital. Not comprehending this balance between issues of existence and non-existence, translations will tend to use terms bound up in those very issues and by that not point to freedom.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.142.wood.pts.htm">Given to Heaping Up and Diminishing,</a> Woodward translation<br />
					The Buddha defines a path which heaps up rebirth and a path that is beyond heaping up rebirth. PED has <i>'apacaya'</i> as 'unmaking' or 'diminishing' which is also the way Woodward (diminishing) and Bhk. Bodhi (dismantling) translate. PED forms the word from <i>'apa + ci"</i> 'up passed-whatever.' A simpler reading would be that the root is <i>'caya'</i> 'heap' and the prefixes are <i>'ā'</i> 'to' and <i>'apa'</i> 'up-passed.' The importance is in whether or not what is being said is that the path dismantles the existing pile of future rebirths, or does not create any new future rebirths. I think the idea of 'up passed' is the more consistent with a path that is made up of not-doings and lettings-go. One creates no new rebirths, gets beyond the reach of rebirths, gives up future rebirths, one does not sit here and destroy future rebirths. That would be an intentional doing certainly bound up in <i>'vibhava-tanha'</i> wanting to un-live. There is the case which may be the one intended here of the ending of a <i>kammic</i> stream by intentially not responding to it; that is not quite the same thing as actively dismantaling. The side note is that even in this long series of suttas with only single terms changed the effect of pairing opposites is to sharpen perception of what <i>is</i> being defined. Here opposites that do not work mean either the translation (understanding) of one or another term is not correct or the understanding of the path is not correct (or both are misunderstood).<br />

					The Buddha defines a path which ripens in pain and a path that ripens in pleasure. Woodward following PED translates <i>'vipāka'</i> 'ripening', as 'fruit' meaning 'fruition'. Since <i>'phala'</i> which <i>is</i> 'fruit' is often used in the suttas the better translation would be the literal 'ripening' or 'fruition' or along the lines of 'consequence' 'result', etc.<br />

The <i>suttantas</i> are found in The <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i> and the <i>Majjhima Nikāya.</i> Since I have 'suspected' for many years that suttas of the <i>Dīgha</i> and some of those in the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i> were compilations, I am very glad to see that this was not a matter of anyone trying to sneak these in pretending that they were originally uttered in the form we find them, but that the fact that they were compilations was being stated outright.</p>

					<i>Raja</i> Pasenadi pays a visit to the Buddha and shows great respect and enumerates the reasons for his great respect. As well as the content of this sutta being food for thought, the sutta is also interesting as a window on history. It is as this discussion is taking place that the king's son usurps the throne. We get a glimpse into the very moment of decision when Digha Karayana, the commander and chief of the Mallas, who is attending on the king asks himself why he must just stand around while the King fawns on the Buddha. At the time, the authority of kingship was vested in certain symbols: the umbrella, sword, turban ... and Pasenadi had removed his sword and turban out of respect for the Buddha, and had given them to Digha Karayana who went off with them and made Pasenadi's son king.</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.48.050.wood.pts.htm">Faithful or Market,</a> Woodward Translation<br />
					An exposition of five controlling faculties (<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>indriya</i></a>): faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom and how one established in faith builds up stepwise useing these to attain insight overcoming all doubt as to the teacher or the doctrine. An important sutta for the understanding of the goal of <i>satipaṭṭhana</i> practice, and for the over-all goal. The goal of setting up <i>sati</i> is clearly stated to be: 'calling to mind and remembering things said long ago'. (other versions of this have it as 'said and done'; see: <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.050.wood.pts.htm#p11">AN 10.50 Woodward § 11</a>). This when joined with tranquillity allows for such detachment as makes clear the perception "A world without end is the round of rebirth.' This is a recollection conjoined with a conclusion about what is remembered as it relates to its projection out into the future and to desire for things of the future. Otherwise stated as 'insight into the rise and fall of things.' At a certain point, recollecting and recollecting (as it is said in this sutta) one has made conscious enough various experiences to see that the idea that things come to an end is, without exception, a feature of everything that has come into existence and that this is not a desirable thing. In other words, a worldly goal is futile and painful. This is important to burn into one's consciousness! Try and imagine having lived forever and ever, having lived every variety of form of life times beyond counting. Try and form the idea of a boundless boredom and the dangers in attempting to escape this boredom in strange and unusual forms (usually ending in rebirth in Hell, <i>e.g.,</i> being a Hitler) or the utter shame of discovering one has been hiding from the truth in mediocrity. Escape from the world, letting absoltuely everything in the world go, being entirely without worldly ambition is not what is generally taught about the practice of Buddhism but the objection is not that the practice of paying attention, or paying attention to the breathing will not produce clarity and strength of mind which can be put to good use in furthering worldly goals; the objection is to the making of the statement or the implying that this is the goal of Buddhism. It isn't.<br />

					This was originally either one sutta, or the first sutta has had additions tacked onto it, so it has been made into one file, retains the divisions into suttas, but does not expand them out in a way that would make them 'stand alone'. Taken as it is it is a really powerful statement. A first person declaration of having achieved a thorough mastery of magic powers and how they were attained (through mastery of the four <i>satipaṭṭhanas</i>). This is also another way Arahantship is declared. This is in complete accord with the reputation Anuruddha has throughout the suttas.

					<p class="f4">This attitude of detachment from what goes on in the world (and by 'world' is meant any form of individualized existence, including in heaven or identification with Brahmā or even higher) is extremely important and so totally different than what is taught in virtually every religion in the world that it needs to be brought up again and again. Trying to become a world reforming activist Buddhist is the single biggest mistake being made by people entering the Buddhist Order in these times [Sunday, November 17, 2013 4:29 AM], and it is also at the root of the difference between what is taught in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and what is being taught by the Mahāyanist schools.</p>

					Three suttas which describe a stepwise method of progression from faith to arahantship. Each slightly different. Since each purports to be a path to Arahantship an equivalence is implied.

For example the Eightfold Path is omitted in all but one of these methods, the <i>jhānas</i> are included in only one.

					<p class="f4">Compare this sutta with <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.089.horn.pts.htm">MN 89 Horner</a> (the much more likely true story). The issue for us is: does it matter? As far as the doctrines contained in the sutta they have no inconsistency with their counterparts in the rest of the suttas (they are in fact mostly verbatim pick-ups). It is distasteful to our sensabilities that the editors should make an explicit claim that this was a true sutta when the fact is insupportable, but the reality is that story telling tradition has always been very liberal in such matters ... right on up to today. (See the sidebar definition of the Japanese <i>shōsetsu.</i>) In any case, what we should not do is 'throw the baby out with the bath water' and disregard the <i>Dhamma</i> within the sutta as not-<i>dhamma</i> because of a liberty taken by some later repeater of the sutta.<br />

					Linked to the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Shortly after his enlightenment Gotama sees no person to whom he should pay reverance and serve. Seeing danger in this situation he decides to place the <i>Dhamma</i> in this position. This sutta is a mixed bag. On the one hand there will be those here today [U.S.A., Saturday, October 26, 2013 6:54 AM] raised on the values of Mark Twain, who will be repelled at the statement:<br />
					<i>"For the perfection of the sum total of virtues (serenety, wisdom, freedom) still imperfect I would dwell so doing honour, obeying, reverencing and serving a recluse or brahmin: but not in this world with devas, Māras, Brahmas, not in the host of recluses and brahmins, not in the world of <i>devas</i> and mankind do I behold any other recluse or Brahmin more perfect in virtue (serenety, wisdom, freedom) than myself, whom honouring I could dwell reverencing, obeying and serving him."</i><br />
					They will hold that this is an immodest boast which was either not made by Gotama or if made by him shows that he is not what he claims to be. I suggest an alternative understanding: Where this statement reflects the truth, it is not a boast but simply a statement of fact. As such, it forces the hearer into a dilemma from which extraction is only possible by a change in values. This change can only come about convincingly through a comprehension of the value of the Four Truths in solving the problem of pain and Rebirth. So the sutta serves the function of providing a check as to one's real state of understanding: If this statement cannot be accepted, one has not understood the system. Then comes a confirmation of Gotama's decision from Brahmā Sahampati. This, in and of itself, is not the problem. There will be those who cannot accept such a thing. That doesn't matter. There is a way to know, and that is to attain vision. Without vision there is no proving the story so it should be just put to the side if there is doubt.<br />
					Brahmā's visit (his second, and we have another in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.089.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.89</a> above) poses another problem (but not one which is impossible to solve!): The Evolution, stasis, and devolution of the universe takes place between the opening and closing of Brahmā's eye. A blink. Putting aside the period of stasis and the period of devolution which our science has not yet come to grips with, that's a third of a blink for the Evolution of the Universe. Let's say that it's a slow blink and comes to 3 seconds, or one second for the Evolution. Let us give our science the benefit of the doubt and accept their estimate of 26 billion years for the Evolution and figure we're right at the end couple of Brahmā-microtrilliseconds. So we have the equation: 1 Brahmā second = twenty-six billion human years. Let's allow that Brahmā is paying attention to what is going on at the time of the Buddha's awakening. After all it is likely the most interesting thing that is happening, and he does have speaking parts. This part (entry, kneeling, uttering his pronouncement (restricted to the basic statement and tossing out the gāthā) and departing) will take him something like one minute and five seconds human time (that is, if he does not make use of Gotama's ability to 'fast talk' which would speed up things by about eighteen times), plus minus, let's say 1 minute.<br />
					Now there are sixty sixty minutes in an hour, twenty-four hours in a day, or 1,440 minutes in a day. 1440 minutes times 365 days times 26,000,000,000 years is 37,440,000,000,000 minutes. (Forget that the <i>Deva</i> year is usually given as only 300 days, we can call that an approximation in a culture where even the educated man was usually unable to count above three.) So what is confronted with in this situation is the need to focus down on what is subjectively, relative to a human, 1/37,440,000,000,000th of a second. On two separate occasions (asking Gotama to teach, and this occasion, if I have not missed others (I have, see above)) in one second. I don't say this is impossible. I say this is possible — I don't know, but suppose Brahmā were able to be a sort of limited omnipresent (able, as with omniscience, to be wherever he wished to be, whenever he wished to be there; there is, in this system, a living outside of time that would permit this. This is a synonym for arahantship, but it may be accessible to non-arahants in a temporary way.) that allowed him to do his bits here unhindered by time. I just say that this is not going to be something that is done off hand by Brahmā. Not something where he is going to waste words, hang around and chit-chat, show his skill at poetizing or preach to the masses.<br />

					Six factors which, depending on their presence or absense in a person in eight combinations make for sufficiency in being of benefit to either the self or others or both. This sutta has two characteristics which are interesting. First is that it is another of the sort which come across as mental exercises: it really stretches the attention to keep track. I really hope that seeing some of these suttas completely rolled out brings home this idea that what we have here in this sort of sutta is an enjoyable challenging way to learn <i>Dhamma.</i> ... not to mention the benefits in strengthening the memory. The second characteristic found in this sutta is the fact that it is one which is very encouraging to even those whose grasp of the <i>Dhamma</i> is somewhat slender while at the same time points to the path to improvement.<br />
					[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p63">AN 8.63</a>] <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.063.pali.bd.htm"><i>Saṅkhitta-desita Suttaṃ,</i></a> The <i>Pāḷi.</i><br />
					The <i>Pāḷi</i> for this sutta which existed here in the BJT version was proofed against the PTS and rolled out. The Hare and Bhk. Thanissaro translations already exist on this site. This is a very interesting sutta because it gives a step-by-step instruction in meditation practice. It is notable here that while the factors of <i>jhāna</i> are stated, they are all just classed under <i>'samādhi'</i> ('serenity'; Hare, Bhk. Thanisaro, Bhk. Bodhi: 'concentration'; which is not a good translation) and are not put in the usual 1-4 grouping and the term <i>'jhāna'</i> is not mentioned. The method for transitioning out of <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> is inidicated here in a way that is only found in a few suttas: that is, by abandoning one, then the other. Also interesting in this sutta is the way serenity practice is combined with the <i>satipaṭṭānās.</i><br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.064.hare.pts.htm">At Gayā,</a> Hare translation<br />
					A valuable sutta for those interested in the development of the 'Devine Eye' or clairvoyance. Gotama provides a step-by step progression from the seeing of vague lights, to seeing the forms of beings, to associating with them and conversing with them, to learning of various sorts of information about them to knowing whether or not one had one's self at some time been one of them.<br />
					This is also a detailed presentation of the cultivation of serenity based on 'light' which is said to be the <i>samadhi</i> most conducive to yielding knowledge and vision. Begin by 'looking at' the vague lights one sees when the eyes are partially closed. Without thinking about the lights, track the lights. The best practice is to not 'focus down,' but to repeatedly glance at, as  one does not generally 'focus down' on things in normal seeing, but glances at things. Overcome the obstacle of delight or surprise, or fear, or attachment to the phenomena or pride in the accomplishment when the vague lights become clearly distinguishable shapes, when the shapes become beings, when the beings become pictures, when the pictures become stories, etc.<br />
					The Hare translation made the best of a confused PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> which was, as we have it, abridged without so indicating and was a mess, the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> was similarly messed up. I have put the <i>Pāḷi</i> into the form I believe was originally intended and have reconstructed Hare's translation accordingly. You've been told.<br />

Bodhi, based on commentary]. Take your pick, though I think my latest here is the closest to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and makes more sense than anything done so far in revealing this most mysterious set of experiences which appear here and there throughout the suttas.

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.070.hare.pts.htm">Earthquakes,</a> Hare translation<br />
					The Buddha states that he is able to extend his lifespan to the end of the evolution of the world. He states this three times but Ānanda does not take the hint to ask him to do so. Māra rejoyces but overplays his hand, pushing for the Buddha to enter <i>PariNibbāna</i> immediately. The Buddha tells Māra not to be impatient for he will do so within three months thereby renouncing the remainder of his lifespan possible. At this statement there is a world-shaking earthquake. Then Ānanda asks about the causes of such earthquakes and Gotama explains the eight causes. A hard sutta for those grounded in modern science to accept. An interesting thing in this regard is the description of the first cause of such a quake which is more or less what we might call a 'normal' quake. In this it is stated that the earth is situated (stands) on water, the water on air and that when the air becomes disturbed, it disturbes the water which disturbes the earth. Our history books record the idea of the earth being on water as ancient ignorant myth. But if the translation of 'water' is its other meaning as 'liquid' and if the translation of 'air' is as its other meaning as 'motion'. We could then see that the statement is that the earth's mantal rests on liquid and that when such things as solar flairs and cosmic winds disturb the magnetic field ... . Well ... the scientists will immediately say that it isn't the liquid strata that causes quakes, but the plates rubbing against each other. But what causes their movement? The other causes are much more mystical. ... but what causes the solar winds? Etc.<br />

					A stepwise method of progression from faith to arahantship. Identical with AN 8.71 above but with the deliverances substituted for the four <i>jhānas.</i> What is the significance of this? First one must understand that the deliverances are not 'the final deliverance' as in <i>Nibbāna.</i> In both the case of the <i>jhānas</i> and the deliverances, <i>Nibbāna</i> is attained upon conscious realization of liberation. <i>Upekkah</i> (detachment), or the fourth <i>jhāna</i> (or any state of detachment above involvement with sense pleasures), or the perception of the ending of sense experience, are in and of themselves not enough. The factors that would bring such detached or liberated states to an end and result in re-entry or rebirth, that is, the <i>āsavas,</i> or corrupting influences, must be brought to and end and seen to have been completely eliminated. So what is being said in these suttas is that one uses the detached state of the <i>jhāna,</i> or the released state of the deliverances, first working on the ending of the <i>āsavas</i> and then attaining freedom from them, and realizing one has got free, one is free.<br />

					Linked to the Warren and Bhk. Thanissaro translations. The <i>Pāḷi</i> has been completely re-worked to reconcile it with the PTS version. This is one of the few cases where I have seen a difference in versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> that could make a significant difference in understanding the message of a sutta. My new translation is my statement as to how I think it should be. There is a little bit of comedy here at the end where the various translators struggle with the fact that in the <i>Pāḷi</i> there is a sequence using <i>'attā'</i> or 'self': <i>vimuttattā ṭhitaṃ ṭhitattā santusitaṃ, santusitattā na paritassati</i> where they have used 'it' for 'self', so they have consciousness walking around liberated, steady, content, not troubled, and become cool. This is not technically wrong, but there needs to be some relaxation in the use of conventional speech in such cases. The beggar is being told about how to attain liberation, so there is no real problem about speaking of him, or his self, as having attained it. I have my own suggested solution as to how to handle this. This is really a sutta that deals with <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualnidana.htm#ahara">The First Lesson; food.</a> Here consciousness is shown as being dependent on a person's attachment to and taking up of form, sensation, perception, own-making and consciousness, and when that attachment is let go, how that takes the rug out from under sense-consciousness and results in liberation.</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.47.011.olds.bd.htm">The Great Man,</a> Olds translation,
					Anuruddha asks about the Great Man and the Buddha explains that one should be called a Great Man only if he has attained freedom of heart. He explains that this is attained by way of <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#nidana">the four <i>satipaṭṭhanas.</i></a> Woodward uses the term 'superman' when he did not need to and then it looks like he tried to dissassociate it from its then current use by the Nazis. Possibly an attempt to short circuit misunderstandings. In fact Hitler was aware of Buddhism and obviously borrowed that term from that source and made use of it in his racial propaganda. It is clear in the suttas however, that in the same way as the word 'Ariyan' does stand for the race, it is its meaning as 'Aristocratic' in mind and behavior that is the use to which it is put in Gotama's system, so the word <i>Mahā-Purisa,</i> stands for qualities attained through understanding and behavior and not the natural attributes of a race. The <i>Ayya</i> called themselves Ariyans in a similar way that many peoples around the world call their tribes 'The People'.</p>

					The Hare translation existed previously here only as a short extract, this is a fully rolled-out version. Linked to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and Bhk. Thanissaro translation. An elegant sutta describing the instructions given Anuruddha which lead to his becoming an arahant. There is also a deep lesson here on the use of psychic power. Gotama first visits Anuruddha by way of 'astral travel' (giving him by this a shock to his system to bring his higher mental powers into play) having overheard him with his supernatural hearing, congratulates him on his thoughts (the seven thoughts of a Great Man), rehearses them with him and instructs him in the attainment of the <i>jhānas,</i> and upon returning rehearses the whole lesson in detail with the <i>bhikkhus.</i> The thing to 'see' is Anuruddha 'hearing' as Gotama rehearses the seven thoughts in detail with the <i>bhikkhus.</i> In this sutta (<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.030.hare.pts.htm#pg158">page 158</a>) there is a definition of set up <i>'sati' (upaṭṭhita-sati)</i> the state achieved by <i>'satipaṭṭhana'</i> (the setting up of <i>sati</i>) which should be noted by everyone practicing that method, that is (Hare's translation): <i>'he is endowed in the highest degree with intentness of mind and discrimination; he <b>recollects and calls to mind both the doings and the sayings of long ago'</b></i> or as in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/07_sevens/an07.004.hare.pts.htm#pg3">AN 7.4 pg 3</a>: <i>'he minds and reminds'.</i> — Whereas mindfulness and paying attention are aspects of the practice of setting up <i>sati,</i> the state achieved does not put the emphasis on 'attention' but on the memory. For 'paying attention' we have '<a href="../../dhammatalk/method/self-defense.htm">guarding the senses.'</a> So the practice of one who has mastered these two basics is: paying attention to the events occuring at the doors of the senses and using the memory to evaluate those events to the point where they are seen as transient, essentially painful, and not-self at which point there is serenity (<i>samādhi,</i> the peace of detachment) and recognizing this detachment as freedom, freedom. The information is here. The method is well taught. What should be done for you by a teacher, friends, has been done. Getting something from that is up to you. Find your place to be alone, meditate!

					This sutta speaks of the birth of the good man being of benefit to his slaves. There will be those who say such a person could not be a good man, that this condones slavery, and that therefore Buddhism condones slavery, and that the Buddha condoned slavery. I have heard these ideas said.<br />
					To understand this from the point of view of the <i>Dhamma,</i> one must bring to the forefront two ideas: The first is that beings are responsible for their own conditions as a consequence of their previous actions: <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/ethical_culture/kamma.htm#fn3">kamma.</a> This is fundamental to the understanding of Buddhism and if this idea cannot be seen or understood in theory, then it must be taken on trust for any of the rest of the doctrine to be comprehensible. It is not that many of the doctrines of the system will not be of benefit whether or not one believes in <i>kamma,</i> it is that without the idea of <i>kamma</i> they are stripped of the logical basis which makes Buddhism otherwise so acceptable to the rational mind. Giving, for example, is beneficial whatever one believes, but without the idea that it produces good results for the self in consequence, it lacks rationality. The idea that beings are responsible for their situations makes the idea of trying to alter the situations of others other than by the attempt to educate them to the benefits of skillful behavior, absurd. If the external form of slavery were abolished (which it has not been, in spite of great effort and much bloodshed) beings whose <i>kamma</i> would otherwise result in slavery would find themselves enslaved in other ways. The second thing to be understood in this matter is that the goal of the <i>Dhamma</i> is the complete abandoning of the world. It is not, as many would try to say, to save the world for worldly living or to make good <i>kamma.</i> The goal is to escape <i>kamma.</i> The Buddha does not waste his time on the impossible. The Arahant has no more attachment to the beliefs held in the world than does the theater goer who sees a play in which some of the characters are slaves and some advocate slavery, or the nature-lover who admires the wild-life without judging the carnage that actually occurs in the wild.<br />
					When asked, Gotama states that no man should sell himself into slavery, or sell human beings (<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p177">AN 5.177</a>). Further there can be no question that he does not advocate forcefully taking people as prisoners into slavery. And it is explicitly stated that a man should not deal in the sale of human beings. Those statements cover the issues relevant to the goal.<br />
					The nature of the detachment of the Arahant is that when not asked directly about something, to judge, or speak out about it, (let alone take action) would be involvement and such a thing down to the smallest movement conceivable, would not be possible: he is completely detached and thinks only of what leads to the goal in abstract terms.<br />
					The <i>arahant</i> can respond about issues if asked directly and where the issue concerns the goal, because, as with the character in a play or movie, that is his role as long as the body remains. To speak out spontaneously about the evils of slavery would be interference indicating attachment and it would be of such a nature as would cause unpleasantness (think of the Civil War in the U.S.A., for an example — the Buddhist is as concerned about not creating unpleasantness for the bad guy as for the good guy) and would be about something that does not lead to the goal.<br />
					Such behavior as is advocated is advocated by example. And here the example is the 'attendant' that elders often had. Such a <i>bhikkhu</i> attends on his teacher without pay, and voluntarily and considers it an honor. Where is the difference then between that and the man who has sold himself into slavery? Just words and attitudes. This is not a topic that can be spoken of, for or against, beyond a certain point, as one that leads to the goal or prevents one from attaining the goal. There are shades of understanding.<br />
					Conversely, when speaking of a topic it is dealt with objectively whether or not the secondary issues are problematic: a good man will benefit his slaves, whether or not slavery is right or wrong.<br />
					Then there is reading this sutta carefully. It in no way precludes that the benefit to the slave of the good man being born might be that the good man frees the slave. Or, if a man had sold himself into slavery because he was unable to make a living otherwise, to treat him as a man who worked for room and board. So it would be going too far to say that this sutta advocated slavery, or that by it the Buddha, or Buddhism advocated slavery, or that the sutta misguides in its description of the good man.<br />

					There are going to be a number of women and feminists out there that will react strongly and negatively to the above five suttas. This is for those who may have the same reactions but are open to another point of view. This is very difficult to understand. What we are dealing with here in this world is like a stage play (... in which we strut and fret our hour ... and then are heard again and again). We play parts. De-parting from the script, we mess up the play trying to focus the attention of the audience on ourselves — that is all one is doing — one is having an infantile tantrum. We blur the story line and bring ruin on many. Its like the washer-woman in the background throwing a tantrum in a play concerning princes in conflict over rule of the world. In a real play, one would be fired. Acting our parts according to the demands of the role, but also following the higher demands of the <i>Dhamma</i> (the over-arching plot), we either create good deeds or no deeds and experience consequences or not according to those deeds. Acting against our roles (evidence of our desire to escape), we act in resistance to the outcomes of our previous deeds. Our previous deeds have cast us into our current roles and resistance to the outcome is like complaint (which is the adult form of an infantile tantrum). It doesn't do any good, it shows our ignorance of how things really work and because it is based on misundrstanding, it is the foundation of misconceived acts leading to further unpleasant outcomes not the freedom we seek. Resistance is colaboration. It confirms and re-inforces the incorrect belief that the situation one is in has substantial reality. It doesn't. It is a pretend thing. Like a dream from which one wishes to awaken, struggle is not the way out. A calm, relaxed, detached calculated wise response to the situation one is in and the events that arise is the way out. That calm, relaxed, detached, calculated response is what is being taught in this <i>Dhamma</i> and these suttas. One plays out one's role ... with a twist. In stead of complaining when told to scrub the floor, one scrubs the floor thinking: 'In this way I will wear out my old bad <i>kamma,</i> and I do not set going by complaint and resistance or collaboration any new <i>kamma.</i>' If acting in this way results in death, the consequence of this sort of behavior will not be a bad outcome. How could it have a bad outcome? The deed is scrubbing a floor for someone. That is a good deed. There is no foundation there for a bad outcome. Fighting with one's role is clustered around with foundations for bad outcomes: anger, hatred, vicious talk, taking things that are not given, lazyness, and harmful acts. Let it go and see how pleasantly one sails through one's role and on to better things. The basic generic rules for real escape are what these suttas are about.</p>

					A sutta for anyone trying to deal with celebacy but also a sutta which reveals the real dyanamic of bondage to sexuality. It should also be of special interest to all those concerned with women's liberation as it clearly points out the error of blaming the other sex for one's bondage to it. In essence it is saying that sexual bondage is a reflection of self-love and that to free one's self from the bondage, one must free one's self from the self-love. This is one sutta where I would definitely recommend the translation of Sister Upalavana. Not because it is better, but because her choice of words reflects the feminine viewpoint in a more pronounced way than the translations by the males. This is also an unusual sutta in that it begins with the female case rather than the male. I think it may be the only sutta in which this is the case. I can also see this sutta applying to the case of homosexuality, where the obsession with persons of the same sex is coming from an obsession with the marks of the opposite sex within one's self.<br />

					<b><i>Dhamma Vicaya:</i></b> Check the verses in this sutta, canto 3, the word translated by Hare as 'zeal'. This is <i>pīti.</i> This has significance for <i>jhāna</i> practice where it is said to be present in the first and second <i>jhānas,</i> suppressed for the third. The use in this case points to the feeling or emotion or motive of an individual for his work. I think this throws an enlightening light, lightning like on the understanding of this term often translated 'rapture' or 'zest'. According to PED <i>Pīti</i> is a term encompassing a spectrum of emotions from 'mild interest' to 'rapture'. Bhk. Thanissaro translates as 'rapture' and characterizes it [no cite] as a state of mysterious mystical power. I think this is a somewhat more mundane state in, at least, the first <i>jhāna.</i> I think my usual translation: 'enthusiasm,' sneeks through.<br />

Challenge yourself. Ask yourself if you could do this. Try it. You will see another way of thinking about the <i>Dhamma</i> and the mind. We have people here that challenge themselves to run a hundred miles barefoot to strengthen their bodies; how much more should we not be challenging ourselves with exercises like this to strengthen our minds! And one more thing! Those of you who are interested in learning the language could find no better way than to be reading/reciting/translating these 'repetitious' suttas. That is one of the Old-time criteria for a good 'yarn' <i>(sutta),</i> that is that it be educational in a multiplicity of ways. Bhk. Bodhi's translation is more complete, but he abbreviates the beginning and thus obscures our opportunity to see Sariputta's stratagem. The sutta is multi-leveled! ... don't forget the story-teller's role.<br />

					A very informative sutta. It opens with the Buddha introducing the practice of abstaining from food after noon to the <i>Bhikkhus.</i> When this is met with resistance by two of the 'Group of Six' <i>Bhikkhus</i> (whose story runs through the suttas and <i>Vinaya</i> as being a group of <i>Bhikkhus</i> who manage to find the loophole in every new rule) Gotama then delivers a scathing rebuke.<br />
					Adapted from Horner: "...even a teacher who sets store on material things, is an heir to material things, and lives in association with material things  — why, even to him, this kind of higgling and haggling does not apply, that his followers will or will not do this or that according as they like it or not. ... For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and lives in unison with it, monks, it is a principle that: 'The Teacher is the <i>Bhagava,</i> a disciple am I; the <i>Bhagava</i> knows, I do not know.' For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and lives in unison with it, monks, the Teacher's instruction is a furthering in growth, giving strength. For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and lives in unison with it, monks, it is a principel that: 'Gladly would I be reduced to skin and sinews and bone and let my body's flesh and blood dry up if there came to be a vortext of energy so that which is not yet won might be won by human strength, by human energy, by human sttriving.'<br />
					Before this Gotama has brought out the reasoning that should be followed in the case of a case where the training initially produces unpleasant sensation, that is, that there are two modes of experiencing sensation, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant: that which is experienced by the one who is attached to worldly gains, and that which is experienced by the one who is striving after letting the world go. The criteria for judgment is not whether one likes or dislikes the sensation, but whether or not good conditions are increasing and bad conditions are decreasing. (So much for 'if it feels good its ok' the creed of the common man of the 60's.)<br />
					Then he mentions the seven states of liberation attainable by one who follows his methods:</p>

					Read with the previous sutta this is another example of the clear distinction being made between the objects of the famous 'Three Characteristics' <i>Anicca, Dukkha</i> and <i>Anatta:</i> that is that all own-made (<i>sankhara,</i> or confounded, or constructed) things are characterized by impermanance and Pain, but that Non-self (Hare erroneously translates as 'no self') applies to all things, own-made or not. This is a vital point for the comprehension of the Buddhist concept of consciousness and <i>Nibbāna.</i> For a detailed discussion of this topic see: <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">'Is <i>Nibbāna</i> Conditioned?'</a> in the Forum.</p>

					Interlinked. This is a very interesting sutta. On the surface it is simply a lesson as to precision of speech: the huge difference it can make when saying 'heaped around with thought' versus 'well heaped around with thought' or, rather 'heaped around with what is well thought'. Then there is the contrast of this sutta with the previous which conveys the basic message but using the term for 'wisdom'. But the most interesting thing going on in the sutta is that it is concerning a statment supposedly made by Devadata. It speaks of Devadata in the past tense, and here Sariputta corrects the <i>bhikkhu</i> quoting Devadatta in a way which makes Devadatta sound wiser than would be the case taking the quote as originally given. Now Devadatta is often painted in solid black where we know from stories here and there that he was, in fact, a highly developed individual who was simply overcome with ambition, so in the name of truth and fairness it is well done that he be defended where he was not being represented well, but I suspect the sutta has been remembered confusidly: that is that the <i>bhikkhu</i> is correctly quoting Devadatta's incorrect recollection of Gotama's utterance in AN 9.25, and Sāriputta was correcting that and that his correction has been misremembered. Maybe not, but if it is as I suggest the deeper message would be in the illustration of Devadatta's fate in the difference in the way he remembered Gotama's instruction. There is some slight evidence that the sutta has been misremembered in the differences between different versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> where in one case at least there is no difference in the way Candikaputto quotes Devadatta and the way Sāriputta corrrects Candikaputto.<br />

					Linked to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and to the Bhk. Thanissaro translation. The full versions of Hare's translation has been reconstructed here; the <i>Pāḷi</i> has been left in the BJT expanded version. There is some food for thought here for those concerned with the tampering that may have gone on in the editing of the <i>Pāḷi.</i> A good sutta for those interested in the <i>jhānas.</i> I would non-carelessness readers to examine the meaning of <i>'nissāya'.</i> Here (and with Bhk. Bodhi and Bhk. Thanissaro) it is translated as 'depend.' Literally the word means 'seated on' and I believe the distinction is important. It is especially so in light of the fact that <i>'paṭicca'</i> and <i>'nidāna'</i> are all also being translated 'depend' (as well as 'conditioned' ... along with <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> ... confused yet?). It is also interesting that in this sutta the scheme changes at the 'Sphere of Nothing's Had' (Nothingness; Nothing is to be Had there) in a way which illuminates the understanding of 'attainment of perception' [Hare: as far as 'perception prevails'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'perception-attainments'; Bhk. Bodhi: (combining this and the next term) 'penetration to final knowledge as far as meditative <i>attainments accompanied by perception</i> reach'] [<i>saññā-samāpatti</i>] and 'penetration of gnosis' [<i>aññā-paṭivedho</i>].<br />

					There are those who say that Gotama would never have wasted his time in the utterance of such a thing as is found in this set of suttas. I beg to differ. There comes a time when thinking over the <i>Dhamma</i> actually becomes interesting fun and doing an exercise in its manipulation such as is found here becomes a light-hearted challenge. Think of it in terms of mental gymnastics. Don't dismiss it before you have tried it for yourself. Its just not something, as simple as it appears, that can be done by one who has not developed a high degree of concentration.</p>

					A comparison of the translations of Olds, Woodward, Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi with regard to an obscure term. The issue comes up often with the question: How can one eliminate desire without desire and if one uses desire how does one eliminate desire? Here not only using desire is rationalized but also using food and the insanity of self-identification. A fourth, using sexuality, is singled out as not a good idea.</p>

					DN 26: <b><a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.26.rhyt.pts.htm">War, Wickedness, and Wealth,</a></b> Rhys Davids, translation.<br />
					An incredably long repetitous sutta not at all in the usual style of Gotama which nevertheless conveys a strong message as to the future. The sutta paints a stark picture of the grinding devolution and evolution of man consequent on his behavior with regard to pretty much universally accepted (and today disregarded) fundamental ethical standards: not taking by theft, not lying, not harming living beings, not being promiscuous, not drinking alcohols, respecting family, elders, leaders. Things we see around us everywhere today where the fact of their leading the people astray is incontestable and yet contested at every turn and defended nowhere. "In times past it was to those of good behavior that respect was paid and to whom people listened; in times to come it will be the course setters in disrespect and poor behavior to whom the people will listen." The consolation in this sutta is the additional lesson of the cyclicity of this phenomena. The world devolves and evolves, round and round.</p>

					A new translation linked to the <i>Pāḷi.</i> An important sutta in terms of comparing translation with translation. What is presented in this translation is a picture of Sāriputta's keen perception into the various nature of illusion and his ability to translate his perceptions into the precise prescription necessary for attaining the goal.

The story of Pasanadi emerges in frequent suttas througout the <i>Sutta Piṭaka</i> where we see him progress from an unbeliever to a believer who loses his kingship because of his faith.

					A new Olds translation, linked to the <i>Pāḷi,</i> PTS Woodward translation, and Bhk. Thanissaro translation at the sections.<br />
					This is an extremely interesting sutta for anyone attempting to break into the just-above-the-beginner level of understanding this <i>Dhamma.</i> In several places throughout the suttas it is hinted that 'seeing the Four Truths, one sees the <i>Paṭicca Samuppāda.</i> seeing the <i>Samuppāda</i> one sees the Four Truths'. Here in this sutta the two are combined in one. I think this only happens in one other sutta. It is very important for understanding the fact that each of the major segments of the <i>Dhamma</i> are in fact just ways of re-stating the Four Truths in other terms. Understanding this will go a long way to eliminate conflicts between various practices that emphasize one or another of the multiplicity of methods put forward in the Suttas and will greatly simplify comprehension of the system as a whole.</p>

					<b><a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.30.rhyt.pts.htm">The Marks of the Superman,</a></b> Rhys Davids, translation.<br />
					The sutta has three elements: a list of signs to be found on the body of one who is a <i>'maha-purissa'</i> or 'great-man,' an exposition of the behaviors that resulted in its acquisition and the consequences of possessing such qualities, and a poetic recapitulation of the prose exposition. There are those who take the descriptions of the signs literally and there are those who take the descriptions of the signs as strictly metaphorical. I suggest that the signs are actual physical attributes which are being given metaphorical descriptions and that the signs themselves are to stand for but are not direct metaphores for supernatural powers — they are more like 'clues'. I have not 'broken the code' for all of them, but here and there in the rest of the suttas we come across clues to their meaning. To provide one example: the Great Man has a long tongue. In this sutta what we hear is that this is a result of blameless pleasant speech and results in a commanding voice that is pleasant to hear. Elsewhere however [KD.snp.3.7] we find out that this tongue is able touch both ears and cover the forehead, and in another place that there is a power of a Great Man known as the <i>Dibba-sota,</i> the Devine Ear, which gives the possessor the power to hear both sounds, heavenly and man made, far and near understanding their meaning. I suggest this is the meaning of this attribute of a Great Man and consequently it cannot be taken in the strictly linear way of a metaphore for quality of speech.<br />
					As to the physical manifestation of these signs there is a state of mind where this physical world becomes very plastic and where this body is capable of willful distortion and that in this state the physical attribute could be projected (made visible or 'superimposed as a vision') such as to be seen just as described.<br />
					I have a further speculation: this is one of a few very strange suttas in the collection which look to me to have been of interest to Gotama himself primarily because of their ancient heritage.<br />

This sutta speaks only to the qualities, not to this very intersting form of rebirth which is only indicated by name. The explanation (sort of) for the term is given by Bhk.

					Twixt the cup and the lip!</p>

					<p class="f3">Old Saying. Proper behavior used to be to give to a beggar from one's own hand to his hand (or into his bowl) because a well-trained beggar would not consider something merely placed before him to have been 'given'. Allowance is made for a person to change their mind about giving even in so short a time as it takes to reach out and take hold. Swifter even than that is the ability of the mind to change.</p>

					Nothing remarkable, just a curiosity. This is the sutta that contains the famous simile of the man who refuses medical treatment for an arrow wound until he knows all there is to know about the wound, the arrow, the shooter, etc. This is also the sutta that is the likely source of the idea that Gotama never answered certain questions. Here he explains why these questions are not explained. This is an important issue to get clear. Gotama does not explain the answers to the questions as to whether or not the world exists etc, but he does answer the questions. He answers both by saying that these are not issues relevant to the ending of pain, but he also answers that these questions arise from a misunderstanding of conditionality which he does explain. So he does answer the questions, it is just that listeners do not hear the answer.</p>

It begins with a pack of lies, the entire thing was almost certainly made up, it contains numerous statements that are not confirmed by the suttas or which put words in Gotama's mouth that are not confirmed by the suttas, or which directly contradict the suttas, and it places the <i>Abhidhamma</i> above the suttas. It is part of the Theravada school's cannon and it should be read by anyone wishing to call himself educated in the literature but it is a bad source of information on how to progress along the way and should be approached with a high degree of caution. <i>Appamāda!</i></p>

					This is a revised translation. I hope this one does what I think it will do which is to make this very important sutta clear. It is certainly better than my previous attempt which I have long felt was very poorly done.</p>

					<b>Vinaya Texts, Volume I</b><br />
					The first volume of this work formatted into individual html files in the style of this site. This volume and the other two volumes that comprise the complete <i>Vinaya Piṭaka</i> are currently available as PDF files from <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/index.htm#south"><i>Internet Sacred Text Archives</i></a> I have reformatted this volume into html so that it may more easily be referenced in discussion, linked to and searched.<br />
					The first volume is primarily of interest because it contains the <i>Patimokkha,</i> and I have linked that section to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and to Bhk. Thanissaro's translation.<br />
					This volume also contains the <i>Mahā-vagga</i> Parts I-IV.<br />
					Additinally I have added a page to the Indexes section of this site which provides links to these materials and page references to the PTS Norman translation of the <i>Patimokkha.</i><br />

					<b><a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm"><i>Jātaka</i> Stories</a></b><br />
					The entire collection of The <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society translation of the <i>Jātaka</i> Stories edited by Professor E.B. Cowell is now available on this site. This collection is in the Public Domain and has been previously made available in five PDF files from <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/index.htm#south">Internet Sacred Text Archives.</a> The collection here has been re-formatted and proofed correcting a few errors ... mostly problems with footnotes. The stories here are each on separate html files which will facilitate different organizations of collections of these stories for text-readers. Not all these stories are sutable or of interest to all audiences.<br />
					In the process of putting together this collection I have posted separately below links to stories of special interest.<br />
					The primary value of this collection is the vast volume of 'lore' that it contains. Fascinating descriptions of magic powers and potions, customs and rituals and the manner in which tasks of ordinary life at the time were conducted.<br />
					Another value, not to be under-estimated, is the inspiration these stories can give to both adults and children. There is here a treasure trove of stories that will instill values such as courage, perseverance, resourcefulness, honesty, generosity, wisdom, learning, self-sacrifice, performance of duty for those in rule and for all to their parents, and many other high values.<br />
					It should be remembered, however, that these stories, even where they are very likely genuinely uttered by Gotama, represent the values held by Gotama prior to his having become a Buddha. Most of the stories represent high values acceptable both in the world and for the Buddhist renunciate, but there are exceptions and it should be remembered that what is being suggested by these stories pertains to worldly existence. Doctrines held by characters in these stories should not be used to support arguments concerning what is taught in the <i>Dhamma</i> except where they are in accordance with the Suttas.</p>

					A greatly beloved and much written-about story. I find it excruciatingly boring drivel and embarasing for its values as well.<br />
					The <i>Jātaka</i> stories, or at least some of them, are held to be of very early origin. I see the collection as a mixed bag. In some cases stories emerge from stories that can be found in the suttas and I don't find even some very fantastic things that appear in them to be too hard to take. This story appears to me to be some poet gone mad with the sound of his own voice and the sway of his emotions and there is what looks to me like a confusion concerning just exactly who it is that is telling this story.<br />
					Still, if you are going to call yourself educated in the Buddhist literature, this is a story you need to have read at least once.</p>

					Note that included in the topics of talk called 'animal talk' which should be avoided is talk about existence and non-exisetence of things. This includes 'self' — the discussion of whether or not there is a self, the statement that 'There is no self', are not proper subjects for discussion. The topic suitable for discussion is that there is 'no thing there that is the self'. The former is an opinion, the latter is something that can be observed.</p>

					A long, convoluted story which contains a detailed description of the story of Gotama's effort to save the Sakkya clan from slaughter by King Viḍūḍabha, son of King Pasanadi. The story is sometimes used to justify Buddhists taking up political action. Reading the story itself shows that the only lesson to be taken from this event is exercise of compassion for all sides and abstention from futile action. This came up in a curious coinsidence in the old <b>BuddhaDust</b> site where I posted an essay on not taking revenge on September 10, 2001. On reflection it occurred to me that it was also curious that the person to whom I was responding had posted an essay advocating taking revenge and using violence in self-defense just at this time and seemingly out of the blue ... a person not heard from since.</p>

					<b>[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_51_iddhipadasamyutta.htm#p32">SN 5.51.32</a>]:</b> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.51.032.olds.bd.htm"><b><i>Tathāgata,</i></b></a> Olds translation.<br />
					SN 5.51.32: <b><a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.51.032.pali.bd.htm"><i>Tathāgata,</i></a></b> The <i>Pāḷi.</i><br />
					This ends the third sub-chapter of eight, or the first thirty-two of eighty-six suttas of the <i>Iddhi-pada Saṃyutta.</i> All but the first and last of the remaining suttas are completely abbreviated in all translations and in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and consist of similes or benefits of cultivating the <i>Iddhi-padas</i> as described to this point. The first and last suttas spell out only the formula for attaching the simile or benefit and only give indicative phrases and elipsis for placement of the details of the <i>Iddhi-padas.</i> These suttas consist of a standard ('stock') set used at the end of many collections of suttas relating to a topic under development which are, however, themselves subject to a rotating variation. One can imagine if these series were spelled out here and in all the other places they occur an image in the mind's eye something like what one might experience in the actual view of a vast desert of sand-dunes stretching out to the horizon as compared to the way the same desert might be thought of without the view or indicated image in mind. In the actual view the beauty of the scope is seen and felt where in the thoughts alone all the biases one has with regard to deserts interfere with the awe-inspiring direct perception. Or the sea. Or the vastness of outer space. Or a jungle. Or life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Things talk to us. What this says to me here is that I as well as the other translators and even the editors of the <i>Pāḷi</i> have not yet surpassed this limitation in vision, but here have come to a stop, short of the full scope of possibility. Let me not stop here, boss! If we're going to play 'translator', let's play it for all its worth!</p>

					<p class="f4">OK, I did two sets:<br />

Ta da! Who's on second?</p>

Notice here the use of broad general or generic terms for the various occupations thus rendering the list less subject to time. 'Swords' is to imply weapons. It could have been 'knives', but knives are sometimes not used as weapons. Trade in living beings implies more than the slave trade and includes trade in animals raised for slaughter. Trade in 'limbs' or 'members' (parts) points to the role of the butcher. The instruction is not to engage in the selling of meat; there is no prohibition against the eating of meat. This is the tactic used in all such issues. This is the tactic used in the case of the trade in maddening drugs. At the time alcohol was the only problem drug but the term points to the real issue: any substance which causes a person to loose good judgment. And again the prohibition is against selling, not use.</p>

					<b>[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_54_anapanasamyutta.htm#p13">SN 5.54.13</a>]: <i>Ānanda Suttaṃ,</i> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.013.olds.bd.htm">Ānanda,</a></b> Olds translation. Number 13 in the series on Minding the Breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this sutta Ānanda approaches The Buddha with what appears to have been a puzzle put to him or an inspiration that came to him. He asks about whether or not <i>Dhamma</i> taught one way might be the equivalent of <i>Dhamma</i> taught another way. The Buddha confirms and explains. This is a very important point that solves many of the issues troubling Buddhist students out there. It provides yet another tool for confirming whether or not a teaching or translation is consistent with the whole. If a teaching or translation renders another teaching or translation invalid, then there is a problem with one or the other or both. It explains how 'The One and Only Way' can be taught 84,000 different ways. It helps a person with a bias overcome that bias by presenting the approach in different ways. For the person with a bias, there is a paradox which must be resolved and resolving paradoxes is always mind-expanding. A very interesting sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">This translation is completely 'rolled out' which is not the case in any other translation, and in addition, I have rolled out the <i>Pāḷi</i> which otherwise is very confusing.</p>
