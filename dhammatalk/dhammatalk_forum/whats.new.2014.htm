					Mahā Cunda approaches the Buddha to ask how to eliminate ideas of 'I' and 'mine'. The Buddha's response is to give him fourty-four pairs of opposites to be resolved upon, thought of, used as guides to follow, things leading upward and which will scour out ideas of 'I' and 'Mine.'<br />
					The fourty-four things are each repeated in accordance with these six ways of dealing with them. This is definitely a 'scouring out' not an expunging! Ms. Horner has fallen victim to the challenge to the memory and changed her translation in mid-stream in this sutta which can lead to the misperception that there are a different fourty-four things being spoken of after the first two cycles. I have noted the change on her translation.</p>

					This sutta is a variation on the previous. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has it arranged such as to have the conclusion applied to each of the five initial statements. If this were the case it should be applied to the previous sutta as well. However if such an arragement were correct it would amount to saying that by correctly seeing any single one of the <i>khandhas,</i> one could attain arahantship. This is not to say that this is not a possibility, as there is some support for this notion in that it can be argued that for the thorough comprehension of one a thorough comprehension of them all is needed, thus it could be said that the goal was achieved through the one.<br />
					It might have been corrected in later versions, but my copy of the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> for this entire book contains a great number of errors of the copy and paste variety. It looks like it went through some sort of initial setup and then was forgotten.<br />

					Whoever holds opinions concerning the self does so with the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness in mind.

					The Buddha defines what he calls the stockpiles <i>(khandha)</i> and what he calls the fueled stockpiles <i>(upadana-k-khandha).</i><br />
					The stockpiles are one of the ways in which the Buddha has broken into smaller units everything in existence. The distinction between the stockpiles and the fueled stockpiles is that the fueled stockpiles are, as the name indicates, stockpiles fueled by the corrupting influences of lust, existence and blindness. In other words they have become the objects of the intent to experience sense-pleasures, existence, or the product of some point of view. The distinction is very clearly drawn in this sutta, but is it correct to draw the conclusion that it is saying that the <i>khandhas</i> exist separately from individuality? Identifying with the <i>khandhas,</i> or one of them, or holding opinions about the self (as per the previous sutta) they are <i>upadana-k-khandha;</i> seen externally, objectively, they are just <i>khandha.</i> When the <i>āsavas</i> have been destroyed in the living Arahant, the <i>khandhas</i> are seen to carry on for the remainder of the lifespan of the being who became arahant. Subsequent to the 'visible' death of the Arahant, the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness <i>dhatu</i> break apart, separate off and he makes no further <i>khandhas</i> the object of intent to experience sensory existence and <i>for him</i> without such intent, because he has destroyed the <i>asavas,</i> do not arise again. So from two perspectives (the living arahant, and the separation from body, etc. of the living being from the <i>khandhas</i> at death) we can see that there is a distinction between <i>khandhas</i> that are fueled and those that are no longer fueled, but we cannot say that there is any sustained or autonomous existence of the <i>khandhas</i> separate from individuality.<br />

					The Buddha advises Sona that making judgments about the superiority or inferiority or equality of the self with regard to others is just not seeing things as they are and then he leads him through the reasoning involved in seeing form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and sense-consciousness as not self because they are inconstant and that which is inconstant is painful and that so seeing one is free, and seeing freedom in freedom one knows rebirth has been left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing is done and there will be no more being any sort of an 'it' at any place of 'atness'.<br />

					The Buddha explains that form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness are, like the five means for the propagation of plants, the five means for the propagation of consciousness. Forms, sense-experience, perception, and own-making are like the earth. Delight is like water. By eliminating delight in forms, sense-experience, perception and own-making, consciousness is not propagated.<br />
					Woodward has made a catastrophic error speaking here of consciousness as 'caused'. What is spoken of in the <i>Pāḷi</i> is 'food'. If consciousness is caused by these things, then by their elimination, consciousness is eliminated. If consciousness is fed by these things, then unfed, it does not propagate, advance into further beings. It is not eliminated. The result is a generation that holds that there is no basis for the idea of consciousness separated from existence. Here the idea is clearly spelled out: by not taking delight in those things which <i>propagate</i> consciousness, consciousness is <i>freed.</i> Not extinguished, freed. We need to create in our way of thinking about this the understanding of 'existence' as being intimately tied up with the individual. That which has been 'own-made.' When all forms of consciousness associated with the concepts of individuality are extinguished, there remains consciousness free of those things. Today there are as a result of this idea of cause, people who will fight this idea tooth and nail. For the sake of your sanity, read this carefully!<br />

					These are all on one file. The <i>Vinaya</i> version of the First Sutta and the story from the Awakening to its delivery to the Group of Five that left the world with Gotama. In the <i>Vinaya</i> the point is to show the origin of the way in which people were accepted into the order. There are some differnces from the way the sutta is presented elsewhere. (See <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/idx_first_sutta_resources.htm">First Sutta Resources</a> and <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">SN 5.56.11</a>). Most importantly I believe is the way this rendition shows that what we have as the First Discourse was developed in detail 'off the books'. That is good because otherwise it is extremely difficult to show how from the bare bones that we are left with anyone could have reached Streamwinning or Arahantship given that none of the details of the <i>Magga</i> are explained.</p>

					The Buddha extolls the accomplishments of Mahā Kassapa by comparing him with his own accomplishments.<br />
					In every case Mahā Kassapa is said to be able to do whatever the Buddha claims he himself is able to do. What, then, is the difference between the two? And why does the Buddha make this declaration? The difference between a Buddha and a very powerful Arahant such as Mahā Kassapa is described as being in the fact that the Buddha was the first and has a greater scope (for example in the number of past lives he can perceive). This sutta was given apparently towards the end of Gotama's life and after the deaths of Sariputta and Moggallāna. It is possible that what we see here is Gotama's attempt to make it clear to the <i>bhikkhus</i> that Mahā Kassapa was worthy to lead the <i>Saṅgha</i> after Gotama's death. It is likely, because of his forest-dwelling and austere habits, that Mahā Kassapa was not well known and it might be questioned as to why he thought himself worthy to assume this leadership role. So a discourse such as this would serve to praise Kassapa and protect him from the discomfort of doubts of the younger <i>bhikkhus</i> and to protect the younger <i>bhikkhus</i> from making the mistake of questioning his authority.<br />

					This and the following nine suttas, which are all constructed using the same form, are not a series of variations, but a series which gets progressively deeper. Altough each sutta is here apparently independent, it is much more likely it was given as a whole, perhaps over several days. In any case, once completed it makes a whole and should be read as such.<br />
					Mrs. Rhys Davids translation here is misleading and spoils the message. She translates the terms 'eye, ear, nose, etc.' as 'sight, hearing, smelling, etc.' which is to speak of the sense experience when what is being spoken of is the sense organ. The idea is that when the sense organ is not stable, anything derived from that is going to be unstable. She gives the lesson no foundation in the concrete. Her abridgements in the following suttas are so severe as to allow multiple interpretations; I have chosen in expanding these suttas those possibilities I believe are most closely aligned with the <i>Pāḷi.</i><br />
					The lesson is:<br />
					Dependent on the eye and visual objects, eye-consciousness;<br />
					Dependent on the eye, visual objects and eye-consciousness, visual contact;<br />
					Dependent on the eye, visual objects, eye-consciousness and visual contact, eye-sense-experience;<br />
					Dependent on eye-sense-experience, eye-sense perception;<br />
					Dependent on eye-sense perception, intentions with regard to visual objects;<br />
					Dependent on intentions with regard to visual objects, thirst for visual objets;<br />
					Dependent on thirst for visual objects pain;<br />
					and this applies to all of the senses;<br />
					for anything derived from earth, water, fire, or wind<br />
					including forms, sense-experience, perception, own-making, or consciousness.<br />
					And this lesson amounts to what? The  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> .<br />

					The Buddha teaches that the five stockpiles (<i>khandha:</i> body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness) amount to a burden, that the asumption of individuality can be termed the grasping of the burden, that desire for experience through the senses, desire to be, and the desire for more being, un-being, or re-being is the lifting up of the burden, and that the laying down of the burden is the utter eradication of desire.<br />
					This sutta has sparked extra interest by the translators because of an assumption made by an early western commentator (as noted in a footnote on the Woodward translation) that where there is a grabing hold, taking up, and laying down, there must be a grabber, a take-holder, and a let-goer and that therefore this sutta proves that the Buddha taught the existence of a being outside the <i>khandhas.</i> This is the error of reading into what one reads what is not written into what one is reading. The Buddha did not teach the non-existence of the self, but neither did he teach the existence of the self. What he taught was the process that results in existence and that the problem with existence was the fact of its coming to an end, and this, and only this is what is taught in this sutta.<br />
					There is a problem for translators in translation of the term <i>'vibhava'. vi</i> = re, un, and 2: re-in the sense of doubling or increase; <i>bhava</i> = being, living, existing. Woodward assumes that any meaning other than 'un' for this word is a later development. I am not sure there is a good basis for that assumption. It is equally possible that Gotama chose that term precisely because of its multiple meanings.<br />

					Faith in the Buddha is faith that Gotama did in fact achieve the end of pain, faith in the <i>Dhamma</i> is faith that that is the way to do it, faith in the <i>Saṅgha</i> is faith that those in the various stages of awakening are following the path pointed out by Gotama, and that, as such, they are worthy of honor.

					Mrs. Rhys Davids has translated <i>'ariyo ñāyo'</i> (Aristocratic Method or Noble Method) 'Ariyan truth', which could lead to confusion of this with the 'Ariyan Truths', which would be confusing translation but correct <i>Dhamma</i> and that is actually the basis for her translation.

					Very similar to the previous sutta, the distinction to be drawn from the similes is that while <i>upādāna</i> is strictly 'fueling', the <i>saṇyojana</i> involves other maintenance tasks. One does not just add more oil, one must also trim the wick. That's the wiki-wacki-wiki.</p>

					<p class="f4">The contimplation of the pleasures to be found in sense experience is the fuel or underlying motivation,<br />
					the yokes to rebirth (viewpoints concerning self, doubts, trust in good works and ethical conduct, wanting pleasure, deviance, lust for material things, lust for immaterial things, pride, fear and blindness) are the mechanisms, the means of maintenance, the actions of fueling, that are used by the individual to keep the flame burning. One needs to eliminate both, but the elimination of one eliminates the other. An important distinction that is the explanation I was looking for to point out why ideas such as 'clinging' are not a good translation for <i>'upādāna'.</i> And if you will permit I will suggest also that this is the real meaning of <i>Dhamma</i> Research. Bear down on what is actually being said by Gotama, and even the sequences of the suttas, and it will be seen that the questions that arise in one's mind have been anticipated and answered by The Buddha. The <i>Dhamma</i> teaches the translator how to translate.<br />

					The Buddha likens the contimplation of that which yokes one to rebirth to the prospects of a young tree that is well tended and recommends in stead chopping that young tree down and destroying it completely.<br />
					Here Mrs. Rhys Davids confronts the clear indication that <i>upādāna</i> means fuel by stating that it means fuel and grasping equally. PED has 'grasping' and such as meaning #2. It looks to me as though in all cases 'fueled' would do and would be more clear. Does a fire 'cling' to the wood? I think the whole idea of grasping is encompassed by the idea of <i>taṇhā,</i> or thirst.<br />
					Why repeat the previous sutta for a young tree? Possibly because some young trees might not recognize themselves in the image of a great tree. Possibly some teaching <i>Dhamma</i> might think the idea applied only to great trees.<br />

					A variation of #55 above, but in this case in stead of saying that such contimplations lead to fueling rebirth, he states that they lead to a 'descent' of named-forms. In other words he has placed this thinking about such things in the position of blindness resulting in own-making resulting in consciousness resulting in named-forms. Again note that the idea is not 'cause' but 'a descent of' as though named-forms were a previously existing phenomena that attached themselves to own-making. I am not suggesting that there is any actual pre-existing nameed-shape, but only that it is 'like that'.

					The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self.

					A famous sutta because of the simile of the monkey for the mind.<br />
					It is interesting to note here that the Buddha speaks of 'heart' 'mind' and 'conscousness' <i>(cittam, mano, viññāṇaṃ)</i> more or less as synonyms much as we do here today [USA Friday, November 14, 2014 9:32 AM].

					This sutta begins as the previous, omits the simile of the monkey, and finishes with what is essentially a condensation of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> into four steps: contact, sense-experience, perception and consciousness.<br />

					This sutta poses some difficulties with regard to making the simile comport with the message. The words to understand here are <i>upaya</i> (PED: approach, undertaking, taking up; clinging to, attachment ... in an- (<i>anūpaya metri causa</i>) not going near, aloof, unattached) from <i>upa-upāya,</i> and <i>apaya</i> from <i>an-upāya</i> (I say), which would have the meaning here not of rise or fall, but of flow or impeded momentum.

					Susima enters the order to learn the secret of Gotama's ability to generate respect and donatives. There he hears about <i>bhikkhus</i> gaining Arahantship and quesions them about super-normal powers. These <i>bhikkhus</i> tell him they have no super-normal powers and have been awakened through wisdom. Questioning the Buddha about this he learns to appreciate the <i>Dhamma</i> and confesses his earlier bad intentions.<br />
					This sutta figures prominantly in the discussion of whether or not the <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for the attainment of Arahantship. Bhk. Bodhi deals with this in a footnote where he points out that the idea that these <i>bhikkhus</i> did not attain <i>jhāna</i> is a statement made by the commentator, not something found in the sutta.<br />
					What is interesting is to ask yourself what it is that Susima sees that has convinced him of the error of his ways and the superior nature of the Buddha's <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					What we have here is a number of <i>bhikkhus</i> that have declared arahantship who also say they do not have a number of supernormal powers usually associated with arahantship. Then Susima is lead by the Buddha through the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> step-by-step and he shows that he has full comprehension of this doctrine. Then Gotama makes a comparison between the knowledge of the <i>bhikkhus</i> with the knowledge of Susima which would indicate that the knowledge of Susima and the knowledge of the <i>bhikkhus</i> is the same. And both parties do not have supernormal powers. But the <i>Bhikkhus</i> are arahants and Susima is not. What is the difference? Two things: Susima has not asked about the third 'vision' of the Arahant: the perception that the corrupting influences <i>(āsavas)</i> are destroyed; and the <i>bhikkhus</i> say they are liberated 'through wisdom'. "First comes attaining knowledge of <i>Dhamma,</i> following that comes knowledge of <i>Nibbāna</i>." This is as much as to say: 'Forget about magic powers, what is important is to take knowledge of the <i>Dhamma</i> and using wisdom so reconstruct your behavior as to lead to <i>Nibbāna.</i> As for those supernormal powers: All the powers mentioned by Susima are relative to this world. For the Arahant they are 'optional,' or possibly 'later' developments. That is: what the Buddha is describing is that wisdom indicates a progression from attaining knowledge to attaining <i>Nibbāna</i> and that attaining supernormal powers or not, should come after. Susima sees the wisdom, recognizes that he has been pursuiing the worldly and that it has lead him into becoming a thief and to the danger of a very bad outcome.<br />
					In the middle of the <i>Pāḷi</i> for this sutta there is a huge or insignificant mistake which has led to Mrs. Rhys davids making a completely incomprehensible translation of a paragraph pretty much necessary for the understanding of the sutta. <i>Bhikkhus</i> Bodhi and Thanissaro come up with alternative, certainly more comprehensible translations. I have suggested in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.070.pali.bd.htm#what?">a note in the <i>Pāḷi</i></a> that the problem is what looks like a messed up abridgment. This book seems to have a number of unusual ways of abridging. This could mean it was early and a 'style' had not yet been worked out, or that it came later and represents an effort to change the usual style. I would go for the 'early' explanation as the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> is a topic that would have been high on any list of priorities for forming a collection based on topics.<br />

(Permission to reproduce occasional Bhk. Bodhi translations was obtained for early versions of this site. Some of Bhk.

					The Buddha enumerates <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualnidana.htm#ahara">the four foods</a> which sustain living and shows their connection to the chain of interdependent factors ( <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> ) that result in birth, old age, sickness, and death.<br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro points out that the foods occupy the position in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> of <i>upadana,</i> or 'support' (Mrs. Rhys davids 'grasping'; Bhk. Thanissaro's 'clinging/sustenance'). He also warns the reader not to fall into the trap of accepting just one of the several understandings of the mechanism of action of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda:</i> it is not just linear, and it is not just circular, and it is not just a description of the three-lives (past, future, present) involved in becoming an existing being: what it is is the most helpful description of the process of becoming an existing being from multiple perspectives simultaneously. As life itself, it needs to be 'seen' three-dimensionally. It applies to the millisecond-to-millisecond movement of an individual through life, it applies to the full extent of the single life, and it applies to the process of repeated rebirth of the individuality. It is equally helpful in the way it points out the places where the chain can be broken.<br />
					This sutta also shows how it can be said that by making the study of Food one's meditation theme, <i>dukkha,</i> or pain can be brought to an end, arahantship attained.<br />

					After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food. Gotama responds correcting his thinking from 'who feeds?' to 'what results from feeding on?', which leads into the chain of interdependent factors ( <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> ).<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.013.rhyc.pts.htm">Recluses and Brahmins 1,</a> the Mrs. Rhys Davids translation,<br />
					The Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> that any seeker or brahman who does not know and see the links in the chain of interdependent factors <i>(paṭicca samuppāda)</i> has not realized the benefits of being a seeker or Brahmin.<br />
					Note that in this version <i>'avijja'</i> or 'blindness' is not listed explicitly. Its place is taken by the statement concerning the seeker or brahman who does not see. The result is the definition of <i>avijja.</i><br />
					[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p14">SN 2.12.14</a>] <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.014.pali.bd.htm"><i>Samaṇa-Brāhmaṇa Suttaṃ,</i></a><br />

					This is a variation of the previous sutta. It is very awkwardly done in the translation (and that was not helped by the abridgment), but it would not be easy to find a way to do it that was not awkward in the written word. It is constructed using a retorical device where one begins with a statement that is unclear and unfinished which is only finished and made clear by a statement at the end. It works to hold the mind of the listener, but in writing just seems to have been badly constructed.<br />

					Kassapa, a naked ascetic, asks the Buddha a series of questions about the source of pain and to each of his questions receives the response, 'it is not such as that.' When Kassapa asks for an explanation, The Buddha teaches him the 'Doctrine Going Down the Middle': that is, the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> the chain of interdependent factors giving rise to the experience of individualized existence and the resulting pain.<br />
					An excellent sutta for sharpening your understanding of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> the idea of 'not-self, and the theories or views of eternalism and annihiliationism.' The idea that one and the same individual does a deed and experiences the consequence implies the continuity of that individual from the time of the doing of the deed to the time of the receiving of the consequences and can be seen to be in error because it can be seen that there is no thing there which is the self or which has existence which is continuous from the doing of a deed to the receiving of the consequences. The idea that one individuality does the deed and another indivituality experiences the consequence (both identified by that individuality as 'my self') implies the extinction of the self that does the deed without the experience of the consequences which is another way of saying that there is no experiencing of the consequences of intentionally done deeds and that the pain that one experiences is a matter of chance and that consequently there could be no escape from pain. Since it can be seen that pain is a result of identification with the doing of deeds done with the intent to create identified-with experience of the consequences, and that there is escape from pain by not doing such intentional deeds, that theory is seen to be incorrect. The resolution of the dilemma is to wake up to the fact that there is no thing there that can be called the 'self' and see the process: Blindness to the process results in own-making, own-making results in identified-with experience of old age, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair.<br />
					Note, while we are speaking about the 'Middle Way' that here that term refers to the  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> , where in the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">First Sutta,</a> it refers to the <i>Magga.</i> What does this tell us? It tells us that these two things are equivalants. See if you can see how this can be.<br />

					Timbaruka asks the Buddha a series of questions about the source of pain and pleasure and to each of his questions receives the response, 'it is not such as that.'

					The Buddha draws the distinction between the fool born identifying with body and pulled around by desires and the wise man born identifying with body and pulled around by desires: the wise man takes on the burden of the holy life and gives up his blindness and thirsts for pleasures of the senses where the fool does not.<br />
					I did a translation because Mrs. Rhys Davids construction does not make it clear that what is being talked about is how, though the wise man and the fool begin at the same point it is how they deal with the situation that makes the difference. Bhk. Thanissaro's translation is good enough. I have introduced some readings that are a little different, hopefully clearer.<br />

					the stableness of the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					the fixed course of the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					specific conditionality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Obviously the saying is famous not because there is any agreement as to what it means, but because of the statement that the phenomena of dependence is something that was discovered by the Buddha, not invented by him, and is, consequently, discoverable by others for themselves. An idea that is always appealing to the rational mind.<br />
					I have changed my attitude towards translating <i>'dhātu'</i> as 'element'. Thought of as 'aspect', as it could be here, it would be a useful translation. But note my use of 'fact' as a translation for <i>'dhātu'.</i> which works very well here. I have not seen this used before for <i>'dhātu'</i> and it seems to reasonably fit most cases.<br />
					I don't think translating <i>'dhamma'</i> here as <i>'Dhamma'</i> makes good sense. This is speaking about something that is possible to discover without the appearance of a Buddha. If 'the teaching' is intended by <i>'Dhamma'</i> that is out of the question in this case. It is possible that this refers to 'a law of nature' (such as the Tao) but that would throw the meaning of the sutta from the discussion of 'this resulting from that' to the nature of <i>Dhamma.</i> And it would do it for only this section, where, if it were a discussion of <i>Dhamma</i> as a law of nature, this idea should be present in the next two sections. I think the simpler explanation is that Gotama is explaining how things work whether or not Buddhas appear.<br />
					As for the obscurity of the last line, I believe that is answered by understanding that in many cases like this when the word 'this' is used, it is intended to mean 'this world' or 'this that has become' or 'this body' or 'this everything whatsoever'. See on this idea the use of 'this' in the definition of <i>'dukkha'</i> at <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.22.pali.bd.htm#p17">DN 22</a> and elsewhere, <i>'Idaṃ dukkhan.'</i> and in the next sutta in the condensed version of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda: Iti imasmiṃ sati idaṃ hoti.</i> The idea is basically as the other translators have it: [~ is the case] through this resulting in that. The idea seems to have been understood in the condensed formula something like I have given it.<br />

					It is very interesting! Although it is stated in a different way by Ānanda, what is being said is that it is because of deliberate intention resulting from ignorance that 'self' is projected into the contact of consciousness with named forms that is then experienced as "I am experiencing". Consequently it is a matter of eliminating the ignorance that propells this projecting of self into such contact that brings pain to an end.<br />

The idea described there is that it is intent (Bhk. Bodhi's 'volition') that is the basis for the arising of pleasant or painful consequences of deeds.

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.033.rhyc.pts.htm">The Bases of Knowledge (1),</a> the Mrs. Rhys Davids translation,<br />
					The Buddha casts the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> in terms of fourty-four basis of knowledge, explains of what that knowledge consists, and applies that knowledge to the future and the past.<br />
					Mrs. Rhys Davids calls the application of the knowledge to the future and the past 'retrospective knowledge'; Bhk. Bodhi calls it 'knowledge of entailment'. What it is is the drawing of inference. "I see that it is this way now, seeing that it is this way now and can be no other way, I understand that it will have been such in the past and I understand that in future it will entail a similar process.'<br />
					This sutta is virtually incomprehensible in abridged form and magical when unabridged. What we have here is the key to the three knowledges of the Arahant, the <i>'tivijja.'</i> Seeing the application of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> to the past is the key to seeing past lives; seeing how it applies to the future is the key to seeing the passing away and rising up again of beings according to their deeds, and seeing it as it is in the present is the way to ending the corrupting influences <i>āsavas.</i><br />
					Purification of each knowledge-base is done by way of seeing, in the mind's eye, actual cases in one's self and in others in terms of each of the bases, past, future, present. 'What is it that keeps me 'being?' What is it that supports that inability to let it go? Is it the desire for sense pleasures? Is it some viewpoint? Is it the belief in ethics and rituals? Is it some experience of self? Does this apply only to me or does it apply to all beings? Does this apply in all cases in the past? In the future?<br />
					This sutta gives us the tools to work through the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> in detail step-by-step. But it should not be done 'intellectually'! You need to 'see' in pictures exemplifying each step. That takes effort but will prove convincing knowledge.<br />

					In response to a series of questions concerning 'who' experiences the various stages of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> The Buddha explains that these questions assume the idea of an individual or experiencer, and a differentiation between the experience and the experiencer and that such an assumption falls into the trap of postulating an eternal self or a self that is annihilated and that with either of those two extreme views it is not possible to end pain and reach the goal of Arahantship and that this amounts to blindness, but by bringing this blindness to an end and seeing that the process is impersonal the end of pain is attainable and the goal of Arahantship can be reached.<br />
					This is a different set of questions than those which are referred to as 'not answered' by Gotama. Here he suggests the questions themselves are mis-phrased. Be sure to check out the Warren translation!<br />
					Working back from the Buddha's response, we have a problem with all translators translating the first part of the <i>bhikkhu's</i> questions as "What is X?" The question 'What is X?' is a valid one and is asked by The Buddha himself rhetorically in many of the previous suttas explaining the factors. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and the CSCD puts this as a compound question rather than two separate questions; the BJT puts it as two separate questions. As one question it can be heard as: 'What is, and what experiences X?' And the Buddha's response then makes sense when he says that to pose the question that way implies an experiencer and a distinction between the experience and the experiencer and that where such distinctions are being made this implies one or the other of the speculative viewpoints called eternalism or annihilationism, both of which can be shown to be in error and which, if held, bar living the sort of life that would lead to the end of pain and Arahantship.<br />

					Almost identical to the previous but without the questioner. Mrs. Rhys Davids abridges completely. Here the BJT is in conformity with the PTS and CSCD in having the question posed as a single compound question. I suspect the first BJT was made to conform to the Rhys Davids translation.</p>

					A group of <i>bhikkhus</i> has gathered around to discuss the appropriate time for visiting a <i>bhikkhu</i> who has become mind. Their suggestions all have to do with the convenience of the visit for the mind-become <i>bhikkhu.</i> Mahā Kaccana however heard the teaching of the Buddha himself on the subject when a <i>bhikkhu</i> asks the Buddha about the same issue. He then relates the sutta [<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p27">AN 6.27.</a>] in which the Buddha describes the six occasions when such a visit is called for: [1] at the time a <i>bhikkhu</i> is harassed by lust for sense pleasures, [2] the anger and hate resulting from deviance from the way, [3] sluggishness, [3] anxiety from remorse, [4] [5] uncertainty, and [6] not knowing what indicates what such as to terminate the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas.</i></a><br />
					Hare has translated <i>'mano-bhāvanīyhassa'</i> as 'a student of mind'; Bhk. Bodhi has 'an esteemed bhikkhu'; P.E.D.: 'of right mind-culture, self-composed'. The word means: 'mind-become-one', or 'one who has made mind-become', and that is how I suggest it should be translated. This is perfectly consistent with the context, which suggests, if it does not absolutely require, a <i>bhikkhu</i> who has realized arahantship. What isn't in this word is anything indicating 'student' or 'right' or 'esteemed' though such a one could be all of these. Who should one go to for help? The most advanced person available. How does one differentiate? Approach, observe their behavior, listen to their instructions, remember, ponder, test, evaluate the results of your testing against the arising and disappearing of states in accordance with <i>Dhamma</i> (<i>Sutta</i> and <i>Vinaya</i>), and don't get stuck on individuals.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.029.hare.pts.htm">Udāyin,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					The Buddha asks Udayi about the five establishments of memory and gets a wrong answer. Then he asks Ānanda the same question and gets a satisfactory response.<br />
					Compare this sutta with AN 6 <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.009.hare.pts.htm">9,</a> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.010.hare.pts.htm">10,</a> and <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.025.hare.pts.htm">25</a>. There were at least 2 Udāyis; this one was 'Foolish Udāyi.'<br />
					Note the similarity of several passages with those found in the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> suttas <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">MN 10;</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22.</a> One could definitely piece together the entire <i>satipaṭṭhana</i> verbatim from passages in the <i>Aṅguttara</i> and <i>Saṃyutta Nikāyas.</i> This, together with the understanding that the <i>satipaṭṭhanas</i> are called <i>'Suttanta',</i> or 'Collection of Suttas' would argue strongly against the conclusion that the <i>satipatthanas</i> were first created whole and then later raided for parts. The <i>satipatthanas</i> may well have been spoken as they are found as collections of earlier bits, but the disjointed 'feel', the lack of symmetry (<i>e.g.,</i> some parts have similes and some not), of the four divisions would suggest a compilation. Who knows? It is not important. The content is <i>True <i>Dhamma</i></i> no matter what. <i>True <i>Dhamma</i></i> is determined by the message, not the reported speaker or time it was delivered or language in which it was delivered. The problem with works such as the Mahayana suttas and some parts at least of the <i>Abhidhamma</i> is that they preach a message contradictory to the goal as found in the suttas while claiming to be the word of the Buddha. Then it is useful to point out that they were composed centuries after Gotama's death and that it is a contradiction of <i>Dhamma</i> to claim that he returned to deliver such messages when the entire point of the system is not returning. That is misleading. To point out the misleading nature of some doctrine is <i>True <i>Dhamma.</i></i> Otherwise one should not get wound up in such issues. One could spend lifetimes digging around in the suttas trying to determine the truth of such things and end up hardly moving ahead at all towards the goal.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/06_sixes/an06.035.olds.bd.htm">The Constituents of Vision</a> the Olds translation,<br />
					A <i>paticca-samuppada-</i>like progression leading to vision of a method to bring about <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					A little six-liner, about which I have written the following in a footnote:<br />
					[The sutta uses] the 'causitive' form. But I object on general principles to the whole idea of causation. Instability does not cause pain perception. One perceives instability; using that perception of instability one, of one's self, (not 'because of', but 'one is enabled by that to'), perceives pain or maybe not.<br />
					If instability caused pain-perception everyone would perceive pain; if pain caused not-self-perception everyone would perceive not-self. If eveyone perceived not-self everyone would let go of living, become dispassionate, and bring pain to an end, snap fingers everyone's an Arahant.<br />
					Both Hare's and Bhk. Bodhi's translations suggest the meaning: "the perception that pain is inherent in that which is unstable'; 'the perception that not-self is inherent in that which is painful'. These are both statements that are consistent with <i>Dhamma,</i> but neither of them are what is being said here in this sutta.<br />
					Hare's 'the idea of ill <i>in</i> impermanence' misleads in that the letter directs one to an intellectual understanding, not a direct perception. This is consistent with his translation of <i>'vijja'</i> as 'wisdom' and <i>'saññā'</i> as 'thought', but does not much help one attain the "perceptions" necessary to "see" a method for attaining freedom and does not accurately give the letter which should reflect the idea that the one perception is based on the other.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi has 'perception of suffering <i>in</i> the impermanent' at least points to the direct perception but it too ignores the letter.<br />
					The idea of the sutta is a mini-version of the <i>paṭicca-samuppāda:</i> the vision of a method for attaining utter detachment provided by the sequence of perceptions. A progression which insists on there being a relationship of dependence between the six items. Given this, that leads to this, this leads to that and this and this and this.<br />
					It is not the constituents of vision are: the perception of instability, and the perception of pain in instability, and the perception of not-self in instability, and the perception of letting go, and the perception of dispassion and the idea of ending;<br />
					it is<br />
					the constituents of vision are the perception that the perception of instability leads to the perception of pain which leads to the perception of not-self, the perception of letting go, the perception of dispassion, and the perception of ending.<br />
					Its being scatter-brained versus being focused. The one way leaves one saying "OK", the other way leaves one saying "I see!"<br />
					One of the original names for the Buddhsits was '<b>vibangh</b>ers', 'hair-splitters'; we need to respect that level of precision in our translations. I include me in this caution.<br />

					Hare's translation of the end of this sutta does not make sense. He has:<br />
					But when walking along the highway, Nāgita,<br />
					I see nothing whatever in front nor behind,<br />
					it suits me,<br />
					even over the calls of nature.'<br />
					The <i>Pāḷi:</i> <i>Yasmāhaṃ Nāgita samaye addhāna-magga-paṭipanno na kañci passāmi purato vā pacchato vā,||
					phāsu me Nāgita tasmiṃ samaye hoti antamaso uccāra-passāvakammāyā" ti.</i><br />
					MO: At such a time, Nāgita, as I am walking along the highway
					and there is no one whatsoever to be seen either ahead or behind,
					I am comfortable at such a time even in passing water and passing matter.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi also mis-reads the situation:
					"When, Nāgita I am traveling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind me, even if it is for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion I am at ease.<br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro has the sense of it:<br />
					But when I am traveling along a road and see no one in front or behind me, at that time I have my ease, even when urinating and defecating.<br />
					The sutta is about the advantages of solitude over the enjoyments of gains, favors and flattery and this is about as strong a statement as can be made concerning such. Put yourself in the position of a king, or famous person, constantly surrounded by a following, who finds himself needing to ... um ... answer the calls of nature.<br />

					Sivaka the wanderer asks Gotama to explain the idea of a <i>Dhamma</i> which is to be seen for one's self.<br />
					There are some significant differences of opinion concerning the meaning of a couple of terms in this sutta and this results also in a very different understanding between translators as to its meaning in general. My take is that it is a very skillfully handled answer to Sivaka's question that not only answers his question, but teaches him a <i>Dhamma</i> lesson that illustrates the answer. Check it out for yourself. Bhk. Bodhi does not get his say, because his translation cannot be posted because of copyright restrictions, but his translation of key terms is cited in the footnotes to my translation.<br />
					I have here suggested a significant change in the usual translation of 'moha' as 'delusion' (Hare's 'infatuation'). I am suggesting 'confusion'. In this sutta we can see that one is supposed to be able to recognize the presence or absense of <i>'moha'</i> within ourselves. People are able to recognize when they are confused, they are not able to recognize when they are deluded or infatuated as those ideas are defined by the fact of the self being deceived.<br />

					A brahman asks Gotama to explain the idea of a <i>Dhamma</i> which is to be seen for one's self.<br />
					A variation of the previous, likely adopted to the different temperments of the wanderer and the brahman. The lesson: explaining and giving an example of '<i>Dhamma</i> to be seen for one's self', is the same. The first term is changed from <i>'lobha'</i> (greed) to <i>'rāga'</i> (lust) and the last three terms are changed from <i>Dhammas</i> about <i>lobha, dosa</i> (hate) and <i>moha</i> (confusion), to bodily-, speech-, and mental-confusion. Hare has translated the last three as 'self-defilement in deed, word, and thought (so please note that it is acceptable here by one of the Oxford scholars to think of <i>'saṇ'</i> as 'self', which is equal to my 'own-' for <i>'saṅkhāra');</i> Bhk. Bodhi has bodily, verbal and mental fault, following commentary. This leaves us wondering how for Hare <i>'dosa'</i> becomes 'defilement' where it was previously 'infatuation', and for Bhk. Bodhi how it becomes 'fault' here where in the preceding paragraphs he has translated it 'delusion'. There seems to be some <i>confusion</i> here.<br />

					This should be seen as a description of the general run of the class of person being described. He isn't saying that all persons of a type are bound always to conform to these descriptions.

					A brahman asks the Buddha if there is one thing which if properly cultivated can lead to welfare in both this life and the life hereafter. He is told that there is one thing that can do this: <i>appamāda,</i> non-carelessness.<br />
					<i>a-p-pamāda</i> = not-carelessness; <i>appa mada:</i> little madness; <i>a p-pa mada:</i> don't sputter fat. Look it up.<br />
					See also for this term: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_03_kosalasamyutta.htm#p17">SN 1.3.17,</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_03_kosalasamyutta.htm#p18">SN 1.3.18,</a> Glossology: <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/appamada.htm"><i>Appamāda</i></a> and other references there.<br />
					There is no other single word in the <i>Suttas</i> given more reverance than this word. It far exceeds in importance the importance that could be given to any translation of it. The word carries the weight of the world. If you are really interested in the supernatural and want a thrill of a lifetime, take <i>Appamāda</i> as a mantra together with a study of the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p1"><i>Mūlapariyaya Sutta,</i></a> together with memorizing the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22"><i>Satipaṭṭhana Sutta</i></a> (in English will do).<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.054.hare.pts.htm">Dhammika,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					Dhammika, a short-tempered <i>bhikkhu</i> is making life so uncomfortable for other <i>bhikkhus</i> that they no longer wish to live with him. As a result the lay followers drive him away and goes to visit the Buddha. The Buddha, without chastizing him, leads him by parables to an understanding of the error of his ways.<br />
					Again the understanding of the nature of persons of the Buddha is amaizing. You can see that if this <i>bhikkhu</i> had simply been confronted with the fact that it was his own actions that brought about his banishment and the dislike of the other <i>bhikkhus,</i> he would never have been able to see or accept the fact. But hearing a story roughly paralling his behavior and seeing in that that there was forgiveness at the end, his fear and defenses must have left him and he could see his fault without losing face. He goes on to become an Arahant.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.056.hare.pts.htm">Phagguna,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					The Buddha describes six situations in which hearing <i>Dhamma</i> before dying can produce either non-returning or arahantship.<br />
					There is a <i>Bhikkhu</i> of some influence out there that has made two statements which are brought into question by this sutta (and by many others which I have mentioned here and there). The two statements are that there is no attaining Arahantship without the four <i>jhānas,</i> and that there is no thinking in <i>jhāna.</i><br />
					Here in this sutta it is clearly stated that thinking and pondering over <i>Dhamma</i> prior to death by one who has previously broken the five yokes to the lower rebirths can produce Arahantship (no mention of <i>jhāna</i>). In this case either there is attaining Arahantship without <i>jhāna,</i> or there is thinking in the first <i>jhāna</i> and Arahantship is attainable from the first <i>'jhāna'</i>.<br />
					I have previously stated that I believe the whole debate as to whether or not Arahantship is attainable with or without <i>jhāna,</i> is a matter of the name <i>'jhāna'</i> having been sometimes put on stages in the end process of letting go and sometimes not. If the case is, in fact, that the process is described here and there without the name <i>'jhāna,'</i> then it is not correct to say that the <i>jhānas</i> are required even though the process when described without that name, is identical with the <i>jhānas.</i><br />
					There is another reason this issue is important to clarify: today there is no way outside comparing one's experience with the literal definitions of the <i>jhānas</i> in the suttas to verify with certainty their attainment. This leaves either accepting the literal definitions of the <i>jhānas</i> or forgetting about them as precise stages and just judging progress by way of what one can see one has let go. One needs to have confidence that one or the other of these two ways of viewing the situation will not lead one off-track or bring one to harm. This is done by comparing what is said by teachers with what is said in the suttas. Without the Buddha present to confirm as true the statement of some person that he is an Arahant, there is no trusting an individual's statement that he is such nor is there any basis for trusting such a one's statement that one has attained such and such a <i>jhāna,</i> or that such and such is or is not a characteristic of <i>jhāna,</i> or arahantship. Comparing one's experience against the literal rendering of the <i>Dhamma,</i> one can at least trust that in so far as one trusts <i>Dhamma</i> at all, one has attained, or has yet to attain what is described. When one's experience matches what is described in the sutta, one can then judge for one's self its fruit or usefulness towards attaining the goal as one understands it. Conversely for one who has faith in the <i>Dhamma</i> the statements that are being made by individuals concerning what is stated in the <i>Suttas</i> must be examined and if found to be in contradiction with the <i>Suttas,</i> must be clearly understood to be so to overcome doubt and/or to avoid being mislead.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.057.hare.pts.htm">The Six Breeds,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					When Ānanda describes what a teacher of another sect calls 'the six classes of life', the Buddha responds with his own list.<br />
					It is very helpful to make conscious the difference in the two ways of thinking. Once you have it in front of you like this it seems obvious, but in fact the approach of the teacher of another sect is, even today, the more common, and almost always accepted without question. When the Buddha asks Ānanda if 'the whole world' approves of Purana Kassapa's list, what he is asking is: "Is this a teaching which is timeless, universally applicable, visible by the wise for themselves in this seen world?" Gotama's list conforms to this set of criteria. So what we get here, aside from the direct lession, is a concise way of seeing how the <i>Dhamma</i> is constructed. I say make this difference conscious because the tendency throughout is for people to read the <i>Dhamma</i> and say: "This is all just common sense," forgetting that this common sense has not previously been at the forefront of one's mind or used to guide one's thinking and behavior, and certainly has not been gathered together anywhere else in such mass. Making yourself aware of this will help to keep conscious the unique opportunity you have in access to <i>Dhamma,</i> and that will help you keep at it.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.060.hare.pts.htm">Citta Hatthisāriputta,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					Citta Hatthisariputta keeps interrupting the discourse of higher <i>Dhamma</i> by two elders and when told not to do so is defended by his friends who call him a wise <i>bhikkhu</i> capable of such a discussion. Mahā Kotthita gently explains to them that although this <i>bhikkhu</i> has attained certain very high states of <i>samadhi,</i> he is nevertheless still world-bound and will soon leave the order. This happens and the <i>bhikkhus</i> are impressed and tell the Buddha who then tells them that Citta will soon tire of the worldly life and again join the order. And this too happens and Citta becomes an arahant.<br />
					Here we have an example of the psychic power of 'mind-reading', but another interesting thing about this sutta is the way Mahā Kotthita approaches explaining the situation, that is in a highly indirect way. There is no mention of Citta, but only of 'some person' who may attain such and such a high state of mind, but because he is proud of this as a personal achievement and uses it to enhance his worldly situation this will result in the corruption of this achievement and his fall from the <i>Saṅgha.</i> The fact that Citta does not recognize himself in the description and therefore takes no measures to correct himself tells the other <i>bhikkhus</i> why it is that he is not up to the discussion of higher <i>Dhamma.</i><br />

					The subtle point arises to the curious mind as to why Gotama here makes the statement that this <i>bhikkhu</i> must have ben a beginner, or if an elder, a scatterbrain. Why should this be a conclusion he reached from this <i>bhikkhu</i> having made this statement? Because no <i>deva</i> could have this sharp a vision. He is talking about being able to see the redeemability of an individual who has but a tip-end of a hair rising above the dung-heap which one could use to pull him out.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.067.hare.pts.htm">Friends,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					The Buddha describes how having good or bad friends affects higher behavior, proper training, the perfection of ethical behavior, and the abandoning of lust for sense pleasures, lust for forms and lust for the formless.<br />
					Hare finds this sutta confusing. It doesn't help that he so constructs the first concept, <i>'ābhisamācārikaṃ <i>Dhamma</i>ṃ,'</i> (forms of higher-behavior) as 'the <i>Dhamma-</i>fore-course' thus making the series linear rather than circular. It is not that the first step is completed before the next step, but that as each step is partially developed it provides a foundation for advancement into the partial development of the next step. Aspiration and testing higher forms of behavior provides insight into the advantages of higher forms of behavior and the disadvantages of lower forms of behavior. Insight into higher forms of behavior provides motivation for further development of higher forms of behavior and the next step of taking up the recommended forms of training. Taking up the training results in insights into the advantages of training and the benefits of further developing higher forms of behavior and the advantages of further training and the taking on of the task of fully developing ethical behavior. Testing forms of ethical behavior leads to insights into the advantages of letting go of lust for sense-pleasures, forms, and the formless. With each step forward there is the recognition that a more fully developed foundation is an advantage, round and round. The end result is the fulfillment of each stage resulting in the fulfillment of the next stage, thusly: The fulfilment of higher behavior fulfills the training, the fulfillment of the training fulfills, ethical behavior, the fulfillment of ethical behavior fulfills the abandoning of lust for sense pleasures, lust for forms, and lust for the formless. As this is fulfilled, that is fulfilled, not when this is fulfilled go on to the next step and fullfill that, etc. Essentially this is saying that higher forms of behavior = training = ethical behavior = abandoning lust for sense pleasures, lust for forms and lust for the formless. I could probably figure out a fourth way of saying this if I worked at it. How about: "This being, that becomes; on the cessation of this, the cessation of that."<br />

					All the charm of this sutta is missing in the abridged form. Here we can also see the importance attached to repetition. This world has been created and re-enforced by exactly such sort of programming since the time of birth ... and throughout eternity in the past. It is hard to change: good advice needs to be continually refreshed in the mind and we can see the awareness of this issue in the minds of the teachers in this sutta.<br />

I object strongly to the translation of <i>'saññā'</i> as 'thought'. I have done a translation for comparison. Bhk. Bodhi's translation of the two terms is the same as mine; his usual understanding of <i>vitakka</i> is, however, the Commentarial idea of 'initial thought'. But what does it mean to 'give up perception of sense-pleasures, etc.?' There is thinking about a thing, and then there is allowing the idea of a thing to be understood as having the potential to provide sense-pleasures, etc. Its at an earlier stage than 'thinking about'. You see an individual of the opposite sex and going beyond the perception of form, you allow in the idea 'attractive', etc. That first 'allowing in' is perception and is a 'sign' of 'self'.

					Unless these six things are given up, there is no attaining Arahantship.<br />
					Hare: Conceit, underrating, overrating, complacency, stubbornness, instability<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: Conceit, an inferiority complex, arrogance, self-overestimation, obstinacy, and self-abasement. Bhk. Bodhi footnotes: "Conceit <i>(māna)</i> is conceiving oneself [to be better] based on birth, etc. The inferiority complex <i>(omāna)</i> is the conceit, 'I am inferior' <i>(bīnassa hīno'ham asmī ti māno).</i> Arrogance <i>(ati-māna)</i> is the conceit of self-elevation. Self-overestimation <i>(adhi-māna)</i> is imagining one-self to have attained [what one has not really attained]. Obstinacy <i>(thambha)</i> is due to anger and conceit. Self-abasement <i>(ati-nipāta)</i> is the conceit 'I am inferior' occurring in one who is actually inferior."<br />
					The translations of the last term seems to be open to doubt. Hare has the note "<i>Ati-nipāta</i> is 'excessive falling over.'" presumably from <i>ati = nipāt.</i> positioning it as a counter balance of <i>thambha,</i> the penultimate term, his 'stubbornness', Bhk. Bodhi's 'obstinacy'.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi's is, as it is defined by the commentary, (per this and C.P.D.) as <i>māno+omāma</i> conceit+inferiority complex. If this were an evaluation of the self as inferior in one who was inferior that would be a true evaluation, not a conceit, and the fact would bar Arahantship without it being a conceit. If we allow that being inferior is a thing which can be corrected, awareness of the fact would even be an advantage in attaining Arahantship.<br />
					If the etymology is as per the commentary, I would tend to think the meaning was more along the lines of taking pride in humbleness or fake humbleness, but the simpler solution is Hare's, where I would suggest not instability, but a word meaning yielding, excessive deference, pandering, grovveling even, how about falling over backwards to be nice?<br />
					All of these states relate to subtle lingering manifestations of the belief in self.<br />

It only says that states beyond are not to be got by such a one. It could well be that rebirth among men was not to be had either. It probably depends on what else the person has done. Mankind is a mixed bag.<br />

					Six guidlines for getting and keeping things.<br />
					A very obscure sutta! I read it as close to a riddle, a teaching of the <i>Dhamma</i> constructed from the hugely broad general idea of getting and keeping. <i>Dhamma</i> here can be read by those concerned with the goal as: <i>'Dhamma'</i> 'The Way'; by the ordinary person as <i>'dhamma'</i> 'thing', or 'good form'.<br />

					Six things that result in great achievement in things.<br />
					Another sutta which I believe must be understood as with the previous sutta, as multi-dimensional: having meaning for the general population hearing <i>'dhamma'</i> in one way, and having another meaning for the Buddhist, hearing <i>'Dhamma'</i> in another way. Hence the insertion of what is not in the <i>Pāḷi</i> by Hare of 'in right things' and of Bhk. Bodhi of '[wholesome] qualities' <i>[dhamma],</i> distorts the sutta.<br />
					The key phrase to understand is: <i>mahantattaṃ vepullattaṃ pāpuṇāti dhammesu</i> [pre-eminant-self-attainment] [bountiful-self-attainment] [fruition] in things. Pre-eminant, bountiful, fruition of things for the self. Hare: "greatness and growth in right things"; Bhk. Bodhi: "attain to greatness and vastness in [wholesome] qualities." Neither Hare nor Bhk. Bodhi give <i>'atta'</i> a double meaning here as 'attainment' and as 'self', but I think it is justified. Remember these suttas were delivered orally. I believe Gotama had such command of the language that he did not use words that could be misunderstood and used words which could be heard in multiple ways constructing his meaning to accommodate those multiple meanings.<br />

The idea is that both from the perspective of the current body and from that of the newly dead individual it is the desire to live in a body which is what makes all the trouble. It could be argued that there might be desire to live and act without a body in the <i>arūpa</i> worlds, but the idea of <i>'kāya'</i> would still apply to whatever it was that was identified as the individual by the individual.

					Six ways of managing things that prevent access to the cool, six which provide access to the cool.<br />
					Here we have the irresistable temptation to say this is a really cool sutta. OK. I give up. This is a really cool sutta. There is here a way of looking at the mind which frees one from the tendency to think that it must be just one way or another. In this sutta we can see that it is more like a horse that needs to be trained to do what we want, or a car that we must learn to drive properly. When you drop that piece of litter as you are walking along, the mind tells you instantly to pick it up. If you ignore that, you are not 'giving heed to the mind when it ought to be given heed to. When you slow down and come to a halt confronting some problem and give up and go on to the next thing, you are not exerting the mind when it ought to be exerted. When you see you are getting silly, going off in a wrong direction, the mind tells you right then that you should stop. If you do not heed the mind then and stop, you are not 'checking the mind when it ought to be checked. When you are getting discouraged and feel you are making no progress, and do not reflect on the progress that you have already made and on the magical way the <i>Dhamma</i> has of little-by-little inevitably irresistably eating away at the dullness of the mind, you are not gladdening the mind when it needs to be gladdened. And the converses: when you do, you are. Pay attention to that voice! It is not just that dreary moraliztic preacher known as the conscience. It is con-science: co-knower of your every action, and always has good advice if you listen when it has good advice and put a check on it when it is giving bad advice. (As long as there is the notion of self, it flips back and forth.)<br />

					Hare's translation of the last item: "one who has achieved right view cannot seek outside (the Order) for a gift-worthy" is misleading. In several places persons who have become streamwinners are urged to continue to give gifts to other teachers as previously, and we are told that even scraping the dinner scraps into the sewer with the idea of feeding the creatures living there will result in good <i>kamma.</i> The idea is 'to honor by way of a gift' with emphasis on the 'honoring'. In <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.175.hare.pts.htm">AN 5.175</a> referenced in a footnote here, where the same expression is used, it is preceded by the qualifier: 'first seeks,' which allows even honoring other teachers though not placing them in the highest position. This might even be translated 'placing in pre-eminance by honoring'. There is no reason not to honor good, knowledgable, wise people who are not on the path. It is just not wise, and is in fact dangerous relative to the goal, to place anyone above the Buddha. ... and this is just what is being done by those who propose a <i>Mahā yana.</i> How so? Someone made up that <i>Mahā yana</i> and by declaring it superior to what Gotama taught one is also saying that that someone is greater than the Buddha.<br />

					Without giving up six things it is not possible to master the four pastures of the masters of mind.<br />
					This is not worded as 'the settings-up of mindfulness', but it is the four variations of each of the four: body, sense-experience, heart, and <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					There is complete lack of agreement with regard to numbering of the suttas within and between the versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> text and within and between the versions of the translations. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> has this numbered as 117 and 118; the PTS translation has it as 117 and 118-130 and omits three suttas. The BJT has the complete set of suttas (it has a completely different way of numbering suttas which I have not used anywhere). Bhk. Bodhi has this as two suttas 117 and 118 but omits the same 3 suttas as are omitted in the PTS text, and the <i>Pāḷi</i> he follows has the same numbering and omition. The omitions must be incorrect although the <i>Pāḷi</i> in the two cases is unclear; without the omitted suttas the usual and expected symmetry is missing. All this has resulted in the necessity of having duplicate numbers for some suttas. There should be no confusion when linking to suttas as there is no duplication in file names.<br />
					Essentially, the difference in the arrangement I have made here is that the suttas are grouped for ease of reading: they should all be read together and so are all included in one file. They are really one sutta and should have one number. It is highly unlikely that they were originally delivered as separate suttas. To get to the traditional number of 84,000 suttas however, they need to be numbered separately and include all the suttas.<br />
					Hare has translated <i>'Dhamma'</i> here as 'thoughts,' which makes this, along with <i>'saññā'</i> and <i>'vitakka'</i> the third term he has translated as 'thought'. <i>'Dhammas'</i> in the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> suttas were originally thought to be 'objects of the mind,' (Walshe, <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.010.horn.pts.htm">Horner,</a> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/mn/mn.010.ntbb.wp.htm">Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi</a>) and translated 'ideas' (<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm#p14">Rhys Davids</a>) 'mental qualities' (<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.22.than.ati.htm#p13">Bhk. Thanissaro</a>) (creating its own confusion with the previous category of <i>'citta'</i> translated 'mind' rather than 'heart' and meaning 'states of mind' or 'states of the heart'); where it should be thought of as either 'The <i>Dhamma</i>', meaning the essential teachings, or, as I believe, 'the viewing of 'things' through 'these <i>Dhammas</i>'.<br />

					The key word is <i>anussati-ṭ-ṭhāna.

'Ever' means at all times. Further it is not the 'further-minding' that is being spoken of in this sutta but the things on which such further-minding stand <i>(ṭ-ṭhāna).</i> Bhk. Bodhi's 'subjects' is an interesting translation, but then he translates <i>'anu-sati'</i> as 'recollection' and this is not just the recollection of certain subjects, but the subjects/objects to be used for (on which to stand) a deeper, further development of the memory.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.010.hare.pts.htm">Mahānāma,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					Mahānāma asks the Buddha about the things that should be made a big thing of by the Streamwinner. He is told to establish recollection of the Buddha, <i>Dhamma,</i> <i>Saṅgha,</i> his own ethical conduct, his generosity, and to reflect on the fact that it is by these means that the various Gods have become such as they are.<br />
					The keyword here is, as with the previous sutta, <i>anussati,</i> and both Bhk. Bodhi (who has Mahānāma often dwelling recollecting) and Hare (who has him living abundantly ever-minding) have missed the idea that Mahānāma is asking about what further development of memory is to be done by the Streamwinner.<br />
					There is, in this sutta the quite rare use of the term <i>'dhamma-sota', 'Dhamma</i>-ear', a term for the Streamwinner. 20 times in all, six times, (most frequently) in AN 6, never in MN, DN, Vin.P., or <i>Abhidhamma P.</i> This is the ability to hear and understand <i>Dhamma</i> from the point of view of Pajapati after he has come to understand that he is not, after all, the creator of the world, that there is nothing that has come into existence that does not pass out of existence (and that consequently he is not responsible for that phenomena either), and that further, there is no thing there that can be called a self (of himself or of any other) onto whom to fix such responsibility. It is the understanding that beings individually subjectively experience the consequences of their deeds. This is also the ability to hear what is <i>Dhamma</i> whether found in a sutta or in ordinary conversation and to hear how any statement should be worded to make it conform to <i>Dhamma.</i> Its not: "A watched pot never boils;" it is: "A watched pot never boils over."<br />

					The Buddha points out that in his day the various trades of the butcher did not pay off in living in luxury, or possessing wealth and social acceptance and that those engaged in such trades could look forward to rebirth in Hell.<br />
					The sutta is so worded that we can say that it is speaking of the material results of those trades <i>in his day</i> which is good, because today we can see that there are at least some of those who engage in those trades on a grand scale who have in fact become wealthy, though I am not sure how well accepted they are in society. How is this explained by <i>kamma?</i> Without claiming that I know precisely, I would speculate that it was a combination of some good <i>kamma</i> having been done in the past together with the mental focus not on the butchery but on the marketing and possibly even on the benefits of feeding people. There is also the fact, however grim, that one engaging in the mass marketing of animal flesh is also intentionally giving life (however short) to, sheltering, feeding, and medicating large numbers of animals. <i>Kamma,</i> according to the Buddhist understanding, would still entail experiencing the eventual consequences of the intent to kill or the intent to have another kill, that is necessarily bound up in this trade at any level.<br />
					There was, at one point in the recent past, an owner of a chicken ranch that distributed chickens throughout the eastern U.S. who personally appeared in television advertisements for his chickens. Anyone with vision, and children, could see his physical resemblance to a chicken and from there imagine a progression from chicken to king of the chickens to ruthless emperor chicken=human of millions of chickens while on their road to the slaughter-house while on his road to Hell for a very long ... um ... it is a pecularity of the Devil that he gives some really bad men 'enough rope to hang themselves' ... stretch. Not so different from being king, emporor, president of a bunch of humans on their way to the slaughter-house. There is some reward for managing the process.<br />

					The Buddha urges the <i>bhikkhus</i> to practice rememberance of death and a number of them come forward with the way they put this instruction into practice. The Buddha praises only those who practice such rememberance in the immediate present.<br />
					This sutta is difficult to get clearly into focus because the worst of the practices can easily be thought to be the best because it appears to be more comprehensive. But what is being pointed out here is the need to bear down on the present moment to really see the possibility that death can happen at any time. To be aware of the possibility that death can happen during the current day, half-day, or meal-time, and that therefore one should behave according to <i>Dhamma</i> is not much more focused on the problem than is the ordinary person's vague awareness that at some point in the future death is inevitable — it allows too much leeway for diversion.<br />

					An odd little sutta on the power of serenity or getting high. A person with these skills could break up Mount Everest but harder to do than that would be piercing the body of ignorance. Bhk. Bodhi and Hare have both translated <i>'samādhi'</i> as 'concentration.' For sure to work the magic power of breaking up a mountain or piercing ignorance the thing that is needed is a high degree of focus or concentration, but the art of working a deed of magic is culminated by the act of letting go, so concentration in and of itself is not sufficient. Similarly to pierce ignorance it is not sufficient to have focused or concentrated insight, that insight must be acted upon, and that act is also letting go. The result in both cases is serenity based on detachment. Concentration or focus is the fulcrum that is used to lever the mind to where letting go results in serenity. So say I.<br />

					About <i>Dhamma</i>-Recitation in Sing-song or Plain-song or chanting. I have a personal bias against chanting <i>Dhamma</i> which tends to make me understand this as a rule against chanting as it is commonly practiced today throughout Asian Buddhist countries. The <i>Pāḷi</i> is confusing or is clear and being misunderstood. On the one hand there was this rule made against <i>āyatakena gīta-s-sarena <i>Dhamma</i>ṃ gāyanti.</i> [long, extended, prolonged, kept up, lasting] [sung, recited, solemnly proclaimed, enunciated]-[sounding, voicing, intoning, accentuating] <i>dhamma</i> [singing]. Then, when some <i>bhikkhus</i> asked about <i>sarabhañña.</i> [sounding, voicing, intoning, accentuating]+[color] they were told that voicing with color was permissable. My persuasion is that this means giving life (a certain amount of appropriate emphasis to occasional phrases) to ordinary recitation, not the rhythmic chanting as it exists today. Going to the reasons makes my case even more dramatically. Both the <i>Bhikkhus</i> and the listeners are obviously being carried away by the sound. The chants are listened to like pop-music. The delivery is too fast and the words are not distinct. And there is in fact no color discernable where color would clarify meaning and this evidences the fact that this method of remembering is carrying forward the word without the spirit. I know this is a losing issue, but I think the practice needs to be questioned. See also here: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p209">AN 5.209</a><br />

					<p class="in2">Life is short, death sweeps out one generation to make way for another, and measured by what went before you and what comes after you life is but an eyeblink of time ... Death reigns in all the portions of our time. The autumn with its fruits provides disorders for us, and the winter's cold turns them into sharp diseases, and the spring brings flowers to strew our hearse, and the summer gives green turf and brambles to bind upon our graves. Deliriums and surfeit, cold and ague, are the four quarters of the year, and all ministers to death; you can go no whither but you tread upon a dead man's bones."</p>

					The exact similarity in the outward form of the practices of a group of ascetics with one method of instruction used by The Buddha leads to the question of what is the difference between the two sects. The Buddha reveals an interpretation of the doctrine unique to the understanding of the awakened mind, inaccesable through any other source.<br />
					A very rich, complex sutta. A lesson in how a complete path to the goal can be constructed in unlimited ways by the fitting together of various individual components of the <i>Dhamma:</i> in this sutta the Diversions <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">[nivāraṇa]</a> and the Dimensions of Awakening <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">[sambojjhangā]</a>. Then the further flexibility of the system is shown by splitting in two the individual components of these <b>Dhammas</b> in various instructive ways.</p>

					Five things which lead to losing release that is attained and five things that lead to preserving release that is attained.<br />
					The term to understand in this sutta is <i>'samaya,'</i> <i>sam</i> = 'On' or 'With' time, age, while. The 'Once upon a Time' or 'at one time' or 'once' of Nidana's. Once in a while. The contemporary Indian English: 'Once in a way.' Vimutti = Freedom. The thing itself is not a mystery: having let go of some attachment, after the unpleasant withdrawl symptoms have passed off, reflecting on the bondage one had to a past habit one experiences a sense of freedom. This is often a matter of a profound sense of freedom accompanied by a 'sigh of releaf.' If this is carefully examined, it is seen to be the whole process of attaining Arahantship in a nutshell. This has lead to problems. There are those who experiencing the more profound variety of these releases come to the conclusion they are Arahants. This leads to a second conclusion: that Arahants can fall back. This, according to <i>Points of Controverys</i> 2. Of Falling Away, (which I am not going to post here as it is a long argument concerning a special situation that is easily summarised as I am doing here) was a position taken at one point by the <i>Sammitiyas,</i> the <i>Vajjiputtiyas,</i> the <i>Sabbatthivādans,</i> and some of the <i>Mahāsanghikas.</i> The most likely explanation of the controversy is that there were, at the time, multiple definitions of the term Arahant. It was a term sometimes used as an honorific for ordinary persons of distinction. It was commonly used of any wandering ascetic. We see this here and there in the suttas in the terms used by outsiders. However in Gotama's system as defined in the <i>Suttas</i> the Arahant is an individual who has attained <i>Nibbāna</i> in this life in such a way as eliminates any possibility of sliding back. This term then is to be applied to and is a valuable instruction for those who have not yet attained Arahantship.<br />

					These last three suttas strike me as being very unusual. The idea is simple enough and belongs to the Gotama of the rest of the suttas, but the vocabulary and syntax seem very different. The reader will note that there is considerable difference between my translation and that of Hare or Bhk. Bodhi. The key word to understand is <i>'Sammatta'</i> This is one of those words that I say comes down from the oldest forms of <i>Pāḷi</i> and is a <i>manta,</i> or magic charm. PED has it broken into two forms, one as <i>saṁ+matta,</i> meaning 'with madness' or intoxicated, delighted, etc., but also (unmentioned) 'with measure'; and the other as abstracted from sammā meaning 'correctness,' 'righteousness' (I say 'High' or 'Consummate') and then defining that as the <i>Magga.</i> I suggest the meaning is derived from an earlier form incorporating all those meanings: extatic (ecstatic) intoxication: "A High Measure of Madness," "Devine madness." The thing is that this word here stands alone and is otherwise undefined in the suttas and the method I have found to be most productive of insight when trying to understand suttas is to take them at face value. To insert, without justification the idea that this word means (rather than is something that results from) the Eightfold Path, seems to me to be going too far. We have too many suttas {e.g. <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.46.052.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.46.52</a>) which teach methods for attaining arahantship which do not rely on the formal Eightfold Path. I see no problem with the idea that what is being spoken of is religious extasy (ecstasy) or, if you would prefer a measured enthusiasm.<br />

					This is an expansion on the previous. Elsewhere termed 'the five-fold guilty dread' [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.092.wood.pts.htm">AN 10 92</a>], 'the five-fold dread and hatred' [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/09_nines/an09.027.hare.pts.htm">AN 9.27</a>]. So far no one's translation makes good sense. The five actions are not the five guilty dreads, they are the sources of the guilty dreads. For the obvious case: The man who 'goes to another man's wife' is the source of the hatred directed at him by the husband, going to another man's wife is not itself hatred. ... though there will be those practitioners of modern psychology who will say that going to another man's wife is subconscious hatred of the other man. So who knows? Bhk. Bodhi translates: 'five perils and enmities' which comes closer. The idea is 'fearful hate-makers'.<br />
					Since the end of World War II, the whole world has more or less abandoned belief in Heaven and Hell and the importance of ethical behavior as the means whereby these states are arrived at. People profess, go through the motions, but their behavior reveals their real lack of belief. How could it be otherwise in the face of the attrocities on both sides of that war, re-inforced by the atrocities of a dozzen smaller wars thereafter. What Creator God could withstand the cross-questioning of a high-school sophomore on this issue? Who would follow the dictates of a God that would allow such things? The key piece of thinking missing has been the idea of <i>kamma.</i> Individual responsibility for one's own destiny. With individual responsibility we can understand that the perpetuation of atrocities is the fearful hate-making deed of those directly involved in the making of the atrocities and the suffering of the victims is a matter of the repercussion of their past deeds. What sort of deeds could millions of people have in common that would result in the carnage they experienced? Since the beginning of history, millions of people have entered armies with the intent to kill, have killed and maimed, and have encouraged hate and actively supported ideas and actions that resulted in depriving others of life. Those intentions and acts come home.<br />
					In the face of such things as the holocaust, the dropping of the atom bomb, the bombing of Dresden, putting responsibility and blame off onto a Creator God destroyed its own usefulness (the idea just breaks down under its obvious absurdity at such magnitude; such deeds require small, blind minds, not the omnicience of a God). But much of the world was left without an alternative. The result is certainly a world led by a nation bereft of ethical practices, whole-heartedly devoted to making a buck and indulgence in sense-gratification. God is dead, there is no heavenly retribution. Even the Golden Rule (which is a corrolary of the idea of <i>kamma</i>) no longer makes sense because it was presented not as a matter of the impersonal workings of nature, but as the rule used in the judgments of this no-longer-believed-in God. Justice now is not a matter of punishing criminals for their deeds but is a matter of inflicting punishment arbitrarily on the basis of cost-benefit analysis. The result of that is life deprived of meaning beyond stimulation of the senses in the immediate here and now. Without the idea of Judgment by God and without the idea of <i>kamma</i> there is no thinking in ethical terms. Life has become a mere matter of amoebic-like reaction to pleasureable and painful stimulus.<br />
					Somehow, my friends, you have got to wake yourselves up to this issue. The alternative, without even considering heaven and hell, is lack of awareness of this stiflingly narrow atomatonic drugery we have here today and the blind following of blind leaders blindly following in their pursuit of votes polls telling them of the preferences of the blind as to the ways they wish to be lead into ever deeper degradation of life in the future.<br />
					You, who have a peripheral interest in Buddhism because it is the fad of the day need to overcome your resistance to understanding the fundamental importance of ethical behavior to access to the higher ideas found in this system. Buddhism here has hardly got into the practice of Loving Kindness. There is no practice of Loving Kindness where there is no understanding of ethical behavior. Without an understanding of ethical behavior Loving Kindness is the practice of Self-love. Whatever makes you feel good is 'loving kindness' and therefore 'right' and everything else is 'wrong'. That is the extent of your system of ethics and that is the limit of your ethical thinking. What is not seen is that this is the path of the psychopath where the most depraved behavior gives pleasure to the self and is, because of that, judged to be 'righteous'. Every experience of sense-pleasure deadens the ability to enjoy it at the same intensity in the future and that results in seeking ever more intense pleasures. The process inevitably leads to every sort of misbehavior and eventually to intentional cruelty. Is that the direction you really want to go?<br />
					What is stopping people from accepting <i>kamma?</i> Partly it is because a misunderstood idea of <i>karma</i> came along with the fruitless appearance of religious revival during the 60s. It was abandoned along with the spiritual revival when it became more interesting to make money, take advantage of the sexual revolution, and reach for power. What is needed for <i>kamma</i> to make sense is seeing the fact of rebirth and how rebirth is affected by <i>kamma,</i>  or short of seeing, an intellectual consideration of the 'likelyhood' or 'probability' of rebirth, and how, logically, it would be affected by <i>kamma.</i><br />
					If you do not 'see' rebirth, and you wish to at least see the rationality of belief in rebirth, start by asking yourself if you really believe your life is going to end at the death of your body. If you are honest with yourself you will see that no matter how much you are told differently, you believe you will live forever.<br />
					Look at your behavior. It is slow to change, as though you had 'all the time in the world.' Take a look! You act as though you are going to live forever. There is hardly any effort there to make every minute count as would be the logical thing to do if there were only this one life.<br />
					But deeper than that, think about consciousness. The study of psychology has focused on the phenomena as a matter of its curious appearance in living beings. Consciousness as a physical phenomena is otherwise totally ignored by modern science. That is not the case with Buddhism. Consider that while you have been taught and can easily see that there are such things in the world, independent of yourself, that are 'solid', 'liquid', have heat and motion, there is also this thing there called 'consciousness.' In this system, that is an attribute of the world. Impersonal. External to the self. It attaches to or arises upon the conjunction of a will to live projected onto named forms.<br />
					You can test this. Sit still. In a short time you will decide to do something and get up and do it. What has happened? Will to be has attached itself to named forms and consciousness of named-forms has arisen.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>Where will to be has attached itself to named forms and consciousness of named-forms has arisen, the results of previous deeds are given passageways to manifestation in that 'circumstance'. What is largely out of your control is the precise named forms that are the result of your intentional actions. That is the danger. Stuff coming back to you in ways you can't control. The only escape is to make sure nothing you intend to do is anything you would not like to experience, the burning off of old bad <i>kamma</i> by understanding, patient acceptance, and non-reaction to consequences out of your control, and the establishment by your intentions of such a mass of deeds done with good intentions that whatever bad thing may return is experienced as insignificant. What is required for that is thinking in ethical terms. What is required for that is a system of ethics based on <i>kamma.</i> That is what you get in this system.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next ask yourself if, at the time of death, you will have had enough of 'doing'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is enough to say that there is a 'likelihood', 'probability', 'possibility' of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is enough to give you a basis for understanding that that rebirth will be in accordance with your intents.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the point of the <i>Dhamma:</i> To educate you, to clarify your thinking concerning your intents as they relate to ethical behavior and <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The resistance to these ideas is coming from a resistance to the idea of morality as being imposed on one from the outside. It has been seen that morality has been imposed on the people by those in power for the personal benefit of those in power. The danger is that in giving up ethical behavior for the sake of self-indulgence one becomes addicted to self-indulgence and ethical behavior then appears to be in conflict with one's own interests. This must be overcome through clearly perceiving the danger and taking deliberate action.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here you will find the tools you need to help you do that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here you find the idea of <i>kamma</i> and ethical conduct in its pure state, a matter of personal welfare having nothing to do with anyone but yourself. Deliberately adopting ethical behavior as described here as a matter of trial and error will in a very short time break the hold of self-indulgence and allow real vision of the freedom from the dangers of fearful hate-making.<br />

					Five things which result in a lay follower being dispised by other lay followers, and five things which result in his being cherished by other lay followers.<br />
					It should be noted that this sutta is directed to lay followers, not, as Hare, to laymen in general. Without keeping that in mind the last item, which deals with whether or not a person seeks 'outside' for recipients of gifts is unclear. Then, making it clear with '(the Order)' bracked to indicate 'implied', the statement, as applied to any layman, becomes untrue.<br />

					The Buddha and Sariputta team up to teach Anāthapiṇḍika and his retinue of 500 lay disciples the advantages of seclusion.<br />
					This sutta is interesting in that it points to the key factor that identifies the first <i>jhāna:</i> the appreciation <i>(pīti)</i> or enjoyment or zest for solitude. <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro has translated <i>(pīti)</i> as 'rapture'. This is not technically an incorrect translation in that the term covers a spectrum of meanings from 'mild interest' through 'excitement, enthusiasm, zest, love, passionate interest and 'rapture.' However as this is an instruction being given to laymen, and apparently being given to them for the first time, to suggest that such should 'from time to time' just, snap-fingers, enter rapture over being in solitude is not realistic and is unlikely to have been the intent. The practice of this system is going to be the most difficult thing anyone has ever attempted, there is no good served by making it appear more difficult than it is.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.178.hare.pts.htm">Rajahs,</a> the E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					The Buddha teaches the value of ethical conduct by asking the <i>bhikkhus</i> if they had ever heard of or seen the punishment of persons who had given up unethical conduct being punished because of their having given up unethical conduct. Then he asks if they had ever heard of or seen the punishment of persons who had engaged in unethical conduct being puhished because of their having engaged in unethical conduct.<br />
					This sutta is valuable because it throws some light on what is meant by the five basic rules of ethical conduct. For example, the harm of lying is shown to be a matter of the lie having caused material damage. There is considerable controversy concerning the meaning of the prohibition of 'drinks fermented and distilled'. This is clearly alcohols, but others today, concerned with 'the drug problem' argue that the drug which they are particularly against should be included. Here we see that the important factor to consider is not the substance but the behavior of one using the substance. If, under the influence of such and such a thing, one kills, steals, lies, or engages in misconduct in the pursuit of pleasure, then that thing should be given up. Probably we should include 'in the pursuit of obtaining, where it is illegal' — for some drugs, like heroin, inspire such fear of withdrawl that where the drug is not freely available the addict will engage in unethical behavior that is not evident when the drug is easily available — witness the 6% of Medical Doctors addicted to morphine whose behavior, because their drug of choice is easily available to them, is exemplary. From the Buddhist perspective this choice of behaviors, these 'rules' are a personal matter, 'good advice', not a matter of judging others or making laws.<br />
					Note that this advice is being directed to laymen. It is here a matter of living while evading the gross danger of worldly punishment. It does not yet reach up to the advantages of ethical conduct in avoiding rebirth in disagreeable states, avoiding unpleasant company, securing solitude, entering the <i>jhānas,</i> or attaining liberation. Anyone, whatever their beliefs, ought to be able to see the sense of these rules.<br />

					Brahman Dona comes to Gotama intending to criticize him for not rising up for Brahmins and is given an education as to various sorts of Brahmins.<br />
					In different places in the Suttas, Brahmins approach Gotama telling him that they have heard that he does not rise up for elder brahmins. They, being old brahmins, see that he does not rise up for them, criticize him for his lack of courtesy and are usually given a lecture on what constitutes an 'elder' or the person who should be shown such veneration. That is, their criticism is answered directly. Here Dona, who is apparently not an old brahman, but simply Brahmin born and educated, observes that Gotama does not rise up for him and concludes that what he has heard is correct and launches into his criticism. But here Gotama's response is very subtle. He speaks to Dona of the doctrines laid out by Dona's own authorities concering what constitutes Brahmin worthy of veneration. Dona recognizes that he does not fit the description of the worthy sorts of Brahmins and he is so impressed with Gotama's subtlty and knowledge that he is converted. Another wonderful example of Gotama's skill as a teacher.<br />
					A very interesting fact revealed in this sutta is that the seer's of old mentioned by Gotama were apparently fully cognizant of all four <i>jhānas</i> in precisely the terms found in the suttas.
					There is also found in this sutta two statements which will strike the modern reader as belief in superstition: The statement that having intercourse with a pregnant woman will 'foul' the child; and having intercourse with a woman giving suck will in some way mess up the milk. In order to cut off the knee-jerk reaction likly on the part of some: read carefully: these statements are not of Gotama's beliefs, but of the seer's of old and the Brahmins of Gotama's time. On the other hand this would be no easy thing to prove one way or the other, and the fact these beliefs are now held to be false seems to me to be just as doubtful a position as to hold that they are true. Of course the one view serves those greatly attached to indulging in sense-pleasures and the other serves to help control that appetite, but I suppose that had nothing to do with the change in point of view.<br />

					Five reasons for draught not seen with the eye.<br />
					Hare has translated <i>'cakkhu,'</i> the eye, here as 'seers' and has by that completely reversed the meaning of this sutta for surely it is by being a 'seer' that Gotama has seen what he is revealing in this sutta. This is another sutta with ideas similar to those found in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/04_fours/an04.070.olds.bd.htm">AN 4.70</a> which will be dismissed without thought by most people. First, examining what is said in the sutta closely one can see that the first three explanations are now found in our science as unusual solar activity, the jet-stream, and water-spouts. The ideas that the rain-cloud gods being lazy and that men not following <i>Dhamma</i> are also reasons for drought are more difficult to explain, but I suggest that the prudent course is to allow for the possibility that there are things in this world that are beyond the knowledge of modern science. Somehow during the period of great re-thinking that was going on around 1600-1800 everything that came even close to the idea of superstition, with the exception of what was found in the Bible, was dismissed outright, with scorn and prejudice such that even venturing to suggest that there were things in this world which did not yield to 'scientific method' was a career-ender ... sometimes at the stake with a fire burning under one's feet, or on the rack with a kindly gentleman, with only the salvation of one's soul in mind, urging one to come to reason. The whole world is energy and all energy is inter-connected. That a deviation in the behavior of one sort of energy, say, human behavior/consciousness, would have an effect on other sorts of energy seems to be entirely within the realm of possibility to my eye. For those unable to accept even these arguments and the suggested possibilities, and yet who do not dismiss the Buddha entirely, the suggestion is, in stead of outright rejecting this sutta, simply put it to one side as a matter of personal doubt. At a later time you may come to a reconsideration.<br />

					Five things that characterize what is well said.<br />
					This is so important in recognizing true <i>Dhamma</i> from false, distinguishing a speaker who understands what he is saying from one who does not understand, and in dealing intelligently with people during an ordinary conversation. Our biases tend to override our ears. Life is much more interesting and informative when we are able to listen and recognize what is well said as well said and what is not well said as not well said.<br />
					This is the thing: Both the con man and and the false prophet and the one who speaks truth say the same things. The con-man and the false prophet say the same things as the one who speaks truth because they recognize that those things exert a very powrful influence over the listener. It is because the con man or false prophet says the same things that the man who speaks the truth says, but says them to a person who is not able to distinguish what is well said from what is not, that the con man profits, that the false prophet cons a following and leads them to their doom. To automatically dismiss something which one has heard a million con men say, just because the words are the same (Trust me! This is for your own good!), is to guarantee that you will miss the time when it is said by the one who speaks the truth. Keeping in mind the five things said in this sutta about what is well said you will be easily able to distinguish between the true and false even when both consist of the same words.

					The Buddha teaches a method for escape from a heart of lust, anger, cruelty, and obsession with shape and individuality.<br />
					This is a sutta that deals with a method we come across here and there but not very often: the idea of escaping one set of ideas by intentionally focusing on another set. Bhk Thanissaro has done a translation which is more readable than Hare's but which does not forcefully make the point that it is switching from one set of ideas to another set of ideas that is the way to 'set right' the heart. Bhk. Bodhi has also missed this point apparently misunderstanding the Commentary. One departs thoughts of lust by placing the mind on thoughts of giving up. It is not that one has thoughts of lust that do not satisfy <i>and</i> one has thoughts of giving up that do satisfy <i>and</i> when his mind departs from lust it is freed; it is noticing that when one has thoughts of lust they do not satisfy and when one has thoughts of giving up they satisfy and when thoughts of lust arise one escapes them by departing from the thoughts of lust <i>by</i> focusing on the thoughts of giving up.<br />

					Don Juan deals with sleep and dreaming from within, making the effort of his practice becoming conscious from within the dream; the Buddhist practice is to bring sleep down to the absolute minimum and to completely ignore dreaming with the result that waking life assumes at will the plasticity of dreams and in sleep one remains fully conscious. In the middle is the exercise of command over the sleeping mind through pre-sleep programming. "Let me retain full consciousness while sleeping and dreaming." "Let there be no erotic content, anxiety-provoking content, or evil thoughts in my dreams." "Let me waken at the first appearance of erotic content ... ." etc.<br />

					Five disadvantages for a <i>bhikkhu</i> that visits with families.<br />
					Hare has rendered his translation understanding that the <i>bhikkhu</i> is offending the family by various things; Bhk. Bodhi seems to have the more reasonable translation indicating that these are offences against the rules for <i>bhikkhus.</i><br />
					The offense of teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six <i>'vācāhi'</i> [voicings] is interesting. First of all, Bhk. Bodhi translates <i>'vācāhi'</i> as sentences whereas Hare has 'words'. Elsewhere I recall this being translated 'verses'. Neither translator explains or cites the <i>Vinaya.</i> The idea is, I believe, found in the phenomena we can observe at talks where the enrapturing power of eloquent speech acts as an aphrodisiac with certain women and where, consequently, the <i>bhikkhu</i> without great self-control might find himself in danger, or, as Hare might understand it, greatly upset a husband or father. The Buddha himself was exempt from the rule and the <i>bhikkhus</i> regularly taught the <i>bhikkhunis,</i> so perhaps this rule applies only to <i>bhikkhus</i> speaking to lay women. I wonder how this rule applies today when a <i>bhikkhu</i> speaks to a group that may include persons of both sexes.<br />

In my grandmother's day and in the first part of my mother's day (@1850 - 1940), in the U.S. in the upper classes or in those who immitated the English upper classes with adaptation for the working husband, the first meal was often very heavy, with porrage with butter and milk and sugar, bacon and eggs and chops and toast, and coffee; there was Elevenzes, a tea-break at 11:00 with cheese, small sandwitches, pastries and tea; Lunch which was soup and a sandwitch and fruit; Afternoon tea at 4:00PM, tea and crackers and cheese; and Dinner, a heavy meal of one or several courses of meat, potatoes, deserts, cheese, fruit, wines or beer, coffee and cigars; a cup of chocolate before bedtime; and a 'Midnight Snack' munching on whatever looked good in the 'ice-box' ... and wonder at indigestion, constipation, nightmares and bed-wetting not to mention the health problems resulting from obesity.

					The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has these arranged such that the suttas on the <i>jhānas</i> are followed by the 'anothers' on the <i>jhānas</i> and the suttas on the paths are followed by the 'anothers' on the paths, and it ends the <i>Upasampada-Vagga</i> here. I have followed the PTS arrangement which is also followed by Bhk. Bodhi. Bhk. Bodhi's version calls what follows to the end of the Fives "Discourses Extra to the Chapter, and divides the materials into three 'Repetition Series'; the PTS just continues as if all the remaining suttas belonged to the <i>Upasampada-Vagga.</i> I have inserted the headings used by Bhk.

					All in one file. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> omits this group, but Hare has included it in his translation. It is included in the Bhk. Bodhi translation and in the <i>Pāḷi</i> he uses.<br />
					Five things which characterize an incompetant receiver of quarters and five things which characterize a competant receiver of quarters.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi and apparently also Bhk. Thanissaro question the meaning of this group as compared to the previous. Hare has no explanation for his translation which does not make sense unless he was thinking of lodgings as being received from the lay community ... so and so many <i>bhikkhus</i> may reside in the kiln-shed of the layman so-and-so.<br />

					All in one file. Five behaviors and land one in Hell, five that land one in heaven.
					Hare has abridged nearly the whole of this sutta, including the initial pattern referencing <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.145.hare.pts.htm">§ 145,</a> but there, in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> the third item is <i>"Kāmesu micchācārī hoti"</i> (and for the opposite <i>"kāmesu micchācārā paṭivirato hoti"</i> where as the <i>Pāḷi</i> for this sutta has <i>"abrahmacārī hoti,"</i> and <i>"abrahmacariyā paṭivirato hoti".</i> Hare translates <i>"brahmacāriya"</i> as "Godly life." This is the difference between 'misbehavior in pursuit of sense pleasures' versus 'not leading the holy life' or not 'behaving like God', or, as it is most frequently (though I believe erroneously) translated elsewhere 'being celebate'. There is a wide spectrum of religious sects included in this set of suttas and one is tempted to think that this pretty much includes anyone who follows these behaviors. But it must be born in mind that what would rule out any person of any belief would be to hold the doctrine '[What I believe} is the truth and everyone else is wrong.' You see? You cannot believe the truth of this statement concerning so wide a spectrum of beliefs if you believe only your view is correct so you cannot claim the safety that this sutta offers holding that belief.<br />

There is no way the beauty of this creation can be appreciated without seeing something like this. Nobody could possibly say that the suttas are repetitious reading this. There are 1000 suttas they are all saying the same thing and not one of them is an exact duplicate of any of the others.) Every sutta is linked to its <i>Pāḷi</i> text and wherever possible to other translations. Both the translation and <i>Pāḷi</i> have been formatted keeping ease of reading and comprehension in mind. The <i>Pāḷi</i> text was read through once by me, comparing it to the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and adjusting the text in most cases to that of the PTS <i>Pāḷi.</i> It should all be proofed again.

					The second discourse given by Gotama, the Buddha, to his first five disciples, on the subject of not-self. This discourse resulted in the five attaining arahantship.<br />
					This is the basic reasoning behind the idea of not-self and follows logically from the doctrines laid out in the first sutta on the idea that the seeker should not go down either the path of self-indulgence or the path of self denial; seeing that that which has become is subject to ending; seeing that ending is a word for Pain; seeing that the source of this pain is thirst; that the way to end the pain is to end the thirst; and the way to end the thirst is to understand, to conform one's behavior, and to make real the peramaters outlined by the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<div class="inner">
					<h4 class="ctr">Vicara</h4>
					<p><b>The word for <i>Vicara</i> has been found!</b> No one can deny this! It is 'Reverie' (<b>'Revery'</b>). The fact, state, or condition of being lost in thought or engaged in musing (<span class="f1">Oxford Shorter</span>). From Middle French <i>rever,</i> to wander as in delirium, related to French <i>réver,</i> to dream. More commonly known in English as 'day-dreaming'. Thanks to:</p>

					<p><i>A certin amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses. It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimes severe, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there, binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas. But too much dreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery! He thinks that he can re-ascend with equal ease, and he tells himself that, after all, it is the same thing. Error!<br />
					Thought is the toil of the intelligence, revery is the volupuousness. To replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food.</i></p>

					<p class="f1">— Les Misérables, Volume II, by Vicor Hugo, translated by Isabel F. Hapgood</p>

					<p>The only problem with this word is it is often narrowly understood as meaning exclusively a sentimental wishy-washy state of mind. The word includes this but is not exclusive to that meaning. There is exalted reverie. Without outside influence predominantly from the commentary and secondarily from intelectual speculation, all it takes to see the reasonablness of this translation is to sit down to meditate for an hour. There it will be seen that to 'think about' a specific subject requires effort. This is <i>'vitakka'.</i> This is modern psychology's 'effortful thinking' as opposed to 'intuitive thoughts' which arise without effort (and usually are, but should never be taken for infallable) which is not accounted for in the <i>'vitakka/vicara'</i> classification of thought.</p>

					<p>There can be <i>Vitakka</i> with <i>Vicara, Vitakka</i> without <i>Vicara,</i> and<i> Vicara</i> without <i>Vitakka,</i> and awareness without either.</p>

					<p>What happens when an effortful train of thought runs out of threads (exhosts the energy which initiated it; has run the limits of its scope) is daydreaming. As common experience shows, one can apparently enter daydreaming directly but this will be seen to be the result of effortful thinking which has been going on with minimal awareness. Daydreams take off from what one has been thinking. Daydreaming requires only paying attention. When effortful thinking has lead to the <i>'yoni,'</i> 'womb' or taproot of some issue which arouses a high degree of interest the result is a daydreaming of a higher order: the cruising over, or <i>'cara',</i> 'carring-on' of the thought in the form of the various implications of perception from that recovered perspective.</p>

					<p>This I believe is the intended meaning of the commentarial description of '<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>' translated, 'initial thought and sustained thought' which was interpreted (originally by the PTS translators) on the one hand in too exclusively rigorous (idealized) a fashion and which, on the other hand, must be understood to have <i>both</i> a lax <i>and</i> a rigorous aspect. When daydreaming is of the higher sort it has the appearance of being self sustained, but this is more in the nature of coasting down-hill on a bicycle. It reaches a limit and to be sustained must be fueled with further effortful thinking or the arising of intuitive thought. The trick at this point, to enter the second <i>jhāna,</i> is to bring one's self to conscious awareness of the fact that thinking, of either form, however thrilling, is transient, does at least require the effort of attention, and is interfering with the pacification of the body and heart, and to let it go.</p>

							<p>God delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations of it; translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, and of nonsense. Very few minds comprehend the devine language. The most sagacious, the calmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they arrive with their text, the task has long been completed; there are alredy twenty translations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party, and from each misinterpretation a faction; and each party thinks that it alone has the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses the light.</p>

					The verses of Angulimala, a fierce bandit/murderer who was converted by Gotama.<br />
					There is one very interesting point to be found in these verses, that is the statement (Mrs. Rhys Davids translation):</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2"><a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.255.rhyc.pts.htm#v882"><span class="f3 c"><b>[882.]</b></span></a> Me who had wrought such direful deeds,<br />
							Fast going to my place of doom,<br />
							Me all that doing's aftermath,<br />
							Hath touched e'en here  — and freed from debt<br />
							Now take I my allotted share.</p>

					<p class="f4">We hear throughout the suttas the statement being made by newly-become Arahants that their debt is paid or that they are debtless. This is a statement that they have become Arahant, and also that they have brought <i>kamma</i> to an end for themselves  — that is, insofar as identified-with personal experience is concerned. Sometimes this happens very quickly, as within half a day. Here we get a tiny glympse of what process has brought about this debtlessness. It is by way of bringing the mind into contact with that debt, so openeing the mind, so refusing to allow evasion and rationalization of badly done deeds that the experience of the consequences of former deeds are allowed to come forward and vent their full weight and thus expire. Seen in the inverse, what is preventing the freedom of <i>Nibbāna</i> is maintaining a guard against experiencing the consequences of former deeds by evasion and rationalization. In other words, "all" it requires, to attain <i>Nibbāna</i> is to let that stuff go and ride out whatever storm is the result. It is also interesting to see in this episode the statement by Gotama to Angulimala that he should 'bear-up'. Does this tell us that there is still, while the body remains some chance of not bearing up? Elsewhere we are told that the distinction between the still-living <i>arahant</i> and the ordinary person is that while pain occurs to both, for the <i>arahant</i> there is no anguishing over the pain, no mental suffering.<br />
					There is another interesting thing that goes on in this sutta when the Buddha suggests that Angulimala do an 'act of truth' for a woman experiencing difficult labor. He tells Angulimala to say that from the time he was born he was not aware of having done any harm to any living being. Angulimala responds by questioning Gotama about how it would be possible for him to say this given his history. The Buddha then tells him to say that from the time he was born as an Ariyan (Aristocrat) he was not aware of having done any harm to any living being. One wonders if this were a test of Angulimala. He was not yet Arahant at this point.<br />

He went right at it. He had managed to kill 999 people, (stringing their right thumbs on a garland for the record,) before Gotama was able to intervene and convert him. He became arahant. It is remarkable to compare the justice system of the time with that of ours today [Friday, July 25, 2014 9:04 AM]. After having murdered 999 people, because he had been converted by Gotama, on Gotama's word, no legal action was taken against him.</p>

					If a person can develop and make a big thing of the idea of their being nothing attractive in the body, the disgusting nature of food, the thought of distaste for the world, the perception of impermanance in everything that has been own-made, and has established in his mind the thought of death, he may expect Arahantship even in this life.<br />
					The final phrase: <i>marana-sanna kho pan'assa ajjhattam supa-ṭ-ṭhita hoti,</i> translated by Hare: "...and the thought of death is by him inwardly well established," accords with the usual understanding. My interpretation is that this term "ajjhattam" is used to avoid the term "his own" or "own" "personal". But here it may have lead to a misunderstanding of the intent, which I believe is the fact that one has come to see that "My own body" too will die, has not risen above that state, is subject to such an end as that.

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.071.hare.pts.htm">The Fruits of Mind-Emancipation (a)</a> The E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					The Buddha describes how the development and making a big thing of the idea of their being nothing attractive in the body, the disgusting nature of food, the thought of distaste for the world, the perception of impermanance in everything that has been own-made, and the establishment in mind of the thought of death has its fruition in freedom of heart and the advantages of freedom of heart and freedom of wisdom and the advantages of freedom of wisdom.<br />
					In this sutta similes are given for such fruit and advantages: lifting the barrier (for letting go blindness), filling the moat (for ending rebirth; you need to see this from the point of view of a conqueror), pulling up the piller (for getting rid of thirst; the piller that supports the structure), withdrawing the bolts (for having broken the five fetters that bind one to the lower births; the bolts that lock the door of escape), being an Aristocrat that "lowered his standard" (dipped his battle flag as a sign of surrender) and dropped the burden (an image that goes against the grain but here standing for giving up the battle to asert a self, for he has let go of the mental derangement: 'I am!').<br />
					An interesting thing to note about this sutta is that these are all things which are to be <i>'pahīnā',</i> 'let go'. Letting go is a thing that is accomplished by no longer keeping a grip on. It just requires stopping. Not-doing. Hold an egg in your hand and then relax all the muscles of your arm and hand. What struggle is involved is not a matter of acquiring something, it is a matter of dealing with one's reluctance to stop indulging in participation. The implication is virtually identical to the Buddha-nature of the Zen Buddhists and Mahayanists, that is, that awakening occurs at the point when one is rid of obstructions, but with the all-important difference that in the Zen/Mahayanist way of thinking this is a state that is achieved, and by an individual, rather than a state revealed by abandoning individuality, and consequently it is a state that has become and therefore it is a state which will come to an end. Said another way the pure mind is held to be a possession of the individual by the Zen/Mahayanist, whereas here the pure mind is obstructed by individuality. One can see the difference in the thinking of the two if one looks at the behavior of the individuals. The Zen/Mahayanist sees no conflict with Awakening in breaches of morality, self-control or holding on to ideas of existence and non-existence whereas Gotama's emphasis on training in these areas reflects the fact that it is with breaches of morality and self control that points of view manifest themselves as individualities.<br />

					The Buddha explains the meaning of 'living in the <i>Dhamma'.</i><br />
					It is not enough to study the suttas, teach the <i>Dhamma,</i> repeat the suttas, think about the <i>Dhamma,</i> but one must also have the wisdom to grasp the attainment of the goal itself.<br />
					My version of this incorporates the idea of going-apart found in the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/05_fives/an05.074.pali.bd.htm">AN 5.73</a> variation on this sutta and summarizes including all the steps. This appears to me to be the way it was intended to have been presented because of the way the final paragraph is worded in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> which looks like an incomplete unabridgment. I have therefore called this, and my version of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/05_fives/an05.073.olds.bd.htm">AN 5.73</a> 'retellings'.<br />
					A significant feature of this sutta is the fact that the attainment of the goal is through the application of wisdom <i>(paññā).</i> Wisdom is a matter of taking known knowledge and experience and coming up with a solution to a problem, answer to a question, method for attaining a goal; knowing what to do. It isn't really the discovery of anything new, such as with insight. It is more a matter of having the heart for the attainment. The use of will-power and resolution to overcome reluctance to attain what one already knows can be attained and how it can be attained. Here we have an explanation for the idea of 'sudden awakening' for which we have an example in Ānanda's awakening at the last minute before he is called upon to recite <i>Dhamma</i> at the first council where he thinks to himself that he himself ought to become Arahant before joining this auspicious assembly of arahants, and he becomes <i>arahant</i> there and then.<br />

					The Buddha likens the struggle to awaken to a battle, and enumerates five sorts of warriors and their parallels in the community of <i>bhikkhus.</i><br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro notes that this discourse is directed at the <i>bhikkhus</i> and speculates that the image of the warrior was designed to appeal to masculine pride and that perhaps some other approach would have been taken with the <i>bhikknuni's.</i> I would point to the way the members of Don Juan's group, so closely aligned with the ancient tradition of the warrior, male and female alike all took pride in the warrior image. History, from ancient times down to gang warfare in New York City in the early 1900s, gives us plenty of examples of women warriors. Here this struggle for awakening is as much a battle for women as for men. The appeal, in the use of the warrior image, is to the courage of the warrior, not his masculinity. The appeal to feminists as well as to male chauvenists is to put sexual identification to the side. Both sexes are the devil to the other.<br />

Hare translates the Lion's reason for his care no matter what the prey by 'Let not my skill fail me!' but it would be better as 'Let not my skill deteriorate!'. The lesson is that the important thing is the skill with which one acts, not the circumstances in which one acts. Lazy habits infect one's entire practice. This world is like a vast swiftly-flowing river; a slight change in a small object may not appear to have an immediate effect, but in a short time it will have exerted some influence on every molecule of that on-going flow. Beings are the inheritors of their deeds.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.100.hare.pts.htm">Kakudha,</a> The E.M. Hare translation.<br />
					Mahā Moggallāna is visited by a <i>deva</i> who tells him of Devadatta's secret ambition to rule the <i>Saṅgha.</i> When he relates this to the Buddha, the Buddha discourses on the various sorts of teachers that need the protection of their disciples and he declares himself not to need such protections.<br />
					This is a deep sutta. First Mahā Moggallāna is told to guard his words; that is to say to not reveal this episode further. How come? And what is the relationship between what Mahā Moggallāna reveals and the dissertation on the various sorts of teachers who are guarded by their disciples?<br />
					What the <i>Deva</i> has revealed to Mahā Moggallāna is likely the very first formation of Devadatta's deviation. At such a point it is possible for a person to give up his corrupt idea. Should his inner thinking become widely known the tendency would be to stick to it rather than give it up. Thus the compassionate thing to do under these circumstances would be to keep quite and hope for the best. The sutta is deeper than this. The second half explains Gotama's warning in the first. It is a masterpiece in the art of the extremely subtle message. Such art is very handy in the case of a group of people whose skill set includes that of mind-reading. Such teachers as are incomplete have tempers. They may get angry at having their flaws exposed. They have benefactors and their disciples guard them. Those benefactors may be powerful and become instruments of revenge. Alternatively, no matter the feebleness of the <i>kamma,</i> they are doing good by giving and they might stop. Further, the disciples count on gifts from their teacher. There is the danger that a pre-mature revelation of a flaw could be seen as a false accusation. And who is who to damage the reputation of another? The true nature of a person will out through his behavior without need of any external prompting. For some of the devices of the evil <i>bhikkhu,</i> see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.103.hare.pts.htm">AN 5.103.</a> There will be those who find this construction impossible to accept. I welcome their understanding of this sutta.<br />

					Five devices of the great robber compared to five devices of the evil <i>bhikkhu.</i><br />
					Nit: Hare translates <i>'Mahā Cora'</i> as 'Robber Chief' in the text. This is not a description of the ways a robber becomes chief of the robbers, but of the ways a robber makes himself powerful. The simile needs to parallel the thing it is illuminating. Also it is misleading to beginning students of the <i>Pāḷi</i> to translate <i>'mahā'</i> 'Chief' where this is not the meaning anywhere else.<br />

					The Buddha lists five things which make a <i>bhikkhu</i> one who is a garland for <i>bhikkhus.</i><br />
					In this sutta Gotama uses himself as an example of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who embodies various qualities which make a <i>bhikkhu</i> a garland for <i>bhikkhus.</i> Self-praise is not a quality which is held in high esteem, so how do we excuse this in the Buddha? By understnding the realization of not-self as having been truly accomplished in him, hence it is not self-praise, it is the praise of the phenomena of <i>'buddha',</i> awakening. He speaks of himself as though of another person. A sutta like this should be used to inspire faith in the reader. Think of how difficult, stupid and transparently phoney (uninspiring) it would be for one to make statements like this if this were not the case of an individual speaking of himself like this without being completely without ego. This is also a good example of how naturally 'conventional speech' is to be used.<br />

					I don't think this is, as Hare would have it, not needing to train; this is the situation of one who has already mastered the training. Contrasted to the previous the idea is that the <i>bhikkhu</i> that is earnestly studying is worthy as here one who is an adept is worthy. Being in the condition of beggars, the <i>bhikkhus</i> are constantly being reminded by Gotama to be worthy of accepting their sustanance from those who labor for their living. There is a huge respect for the weight, that is to say, difficulty, of sustaining life, which is to say, the bearing of pain for life's sake. It is enough to do it for one's self and family; to do it for an unworthy stranger is heroic. 'Worthy' meaning that the <i>kammic</i> rebound should greatly exceed that of an ordinary person; a thing which is effected by detachment, which is the result of virtue, etc. For the unworthy, bumming off the labors of others is a swift road to hell and is especially so for the <i>bhikkhus</i> of Gotama's <i>Saṅgha</i> because in this case there is a high expectation of bountiful return (one gets to see and experience the pain and disappointment one has allowed another to suffer for one ... multiplied a few hundred thousand fold).<br />

					Five characteristics recommended for <i>bhikkhus</i> who would walk behind their teacher on his begging round.<br />
					Presumably this serves at least two functions: the popularity of the teacher inspires the giving of more and better food, and the disciple becomes known as a follower of the popular teacher. I am not familiar with all the details of this practice and would welcome more information. The requirement to take the laden bowl looks as though there was some routine for collecting food for the group. How did that work? Is it a requirement for going on the begging round to walk in such a line? We hear of elders going on their rounds alone, at what point can a <i>bhikkhu</i> elect to go alone? Note the hair on these <i>bhikkhus</i> heads. The <i>Bhikkhu</i> is to shave his head only when the hair has grown two finger-widths in length.<br />

					One who would get high needs to be able to overcome his reactions to the impact of stimuli on the five senses.<br />
					The key word here is <i>'khama'.</i> PED: (a) patient, forgiving. (b) enduring, bearing, hardened to. To have patience with, etc. For example it is not conducive to getting high to be imagining machine-gunning a dog which has been barking for the past hour non-stop. One needs to overcome one's reactions to the sight of an attractive person of the opposite sex. The scent of food cooking on the bar-b-que next door. We need to be calm, cool, collected, impassive. Note that this list does not include stimulation of the mind. Why would this not be a problem? Because that which does not pertain to reactions to stimulus of the five senses is not a barrior to high serenity. As usual I object to the translation of <i>'samādhi'</i> as 'concentration.' Here the discussion is of High <i>Samādhi (Sammā Samadhi)</i> where what is being spoken of is the serenity that <i>is a result</i> of concentration among other things.<br />

					I object to Hare's (and most other translators') 'right' for <i>'sammā'</i> because its meaning as 'upright' or 'straight' is misunderstood to be 'the only correct thing' whereas the meaning is 'the best' or 'highest' or 'consummate' thing. The opposite of that <i>'micchā'</i> is misguided, low, contrary. Hare's use of 'wrong' shows exactly that his thinking is 'this is the right and all else is wrong'. And that is the problem, for it is that idea which has plagued mankind and especially religious freedom since forever. <i>'Sammā'</i> and <i>'micchā'</i> are concepts of efficacy relative to the Buddhist goal. There is no claim to absolute truth being made by the <i>Magga.</i> See the wording of the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.011.olds.bd.htm">First Sutta:</a> "...are ends not to be gone after <i>by one embarking on the seeker's life.</i>" <i>Dve me bhikkhave, antā pabbajitena na sevitabbā.</i> See: <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/samma_miccha~.htm">discussion</a> and <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samma.htm">Glossology: <i>Sammā.</i></a> Its not a small irrelevant issue, it has to do with orientation. You can't get there going the wrong direction. (That's a statement relative to the goal!) If you believe 'this Way' is right and all other ways are wrong, you are attached to both the wrong and the consummate and misunderstand both and unless you let that position go you cannot achieve the detachment needed for freedom and the goal. Period. Words have power. The pen is mightier than the sward. Etc. "Right" and "Wrong" as absolutes have dealt nothing but grief to this world. Their use in Buddhist translations is out of place and entirely a consequence of the Early Christian-biased translations of the PTS such as this. Correcting the error is a matter of overcoming misplaced fear of and respect for the authority of the Oxford scholars. The Oxford scholars themselves would be the first to say they were fumbling in the dark and 2. we have evidence enough right here to see that they were all too human, not arahants, and subject to human error. The other hindrance to getting this ... um ... going in the optimal direction is that translators wish to avoid controversy and to find acceptance but this is nothing but pandering to the low minded and is no way to 'guide the flock'. We need to let these terms go!<br />

					The Buddha compares the rule of a monarch and the Teacher to the rolling of wheels. The factors that make for the lasting rule of a monarch are similar to those that made for the lasting of the <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					Hare has both the monarch and the <i>Tathāgata</i> knowing <i>Dhamma</i> with a capital 'D'. This is probably the way this should be done throughout. We capitalize 'Tao.' Both the King and the <i>Tathāgata</i> follow 'good form', which was known as 'the <i>Dhamma</i>'. What Gotama taught was that <i>Dhamma</i> as he saw it hence it came to be known as 'the <i>Dhamma</i>'. We should probably say 'The <i>Dhamma</i> according to Gotama' when speaking specifically of the teachings, but reverence for Gotama as well as appreciation for the perfect conformity of the Teachings with Good Form have blurred the difference. Otherwise when the meaning of the term is an ordinary thing, we should use lower case.<br />
					Hare cites the commentary when explaining the understanding of what 'knowing times' means. This needs to be understood in the case of the Monarch as knowing the appropriate time to speek or maintain silence (when an idea will best be received), knowing the time for military or diplomatic action or when to remain inactive, when to bestow gifts and honours, and so forth.<br />

					The Buddha describes how if one teaches even only one link in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> one may be called a <i>Dhamma</i> Teacher; if one practices only one link one may be called one who lives the <i>Dhamma</i> of the <i>Dhamma;</i> if one experiences freedom as a consequence of the experience of only one link one may be said to have won <i>Nibbāna</i> in this life.

					Mahā-Koṭṭhita puts questions about the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> to Sāriputta. He frames his questions in the form of the four basic propositions about existence put into questions about whether or not the links in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> are created by the self or other or both or neither.<br />
					Sāriputta's responses are followed by the 36 statements made in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p16">SN 2.16.</a><br />
					Rather than dispute with the other translations item by item, I have taken Mrs. Rhys Davids' translation and completely reworked it closely following the <i>Pāḷi.</i> It amounts to almost a completely new translation but taking less than half the time of doing a complete new translation. This confirms to me the thought that with careful use of search and replace a complete collection of the suttas using a uniform 'best translation' vocabulary is within the realm of possibility.<br />
					The interesting and important thing in this sutta is the simile, which if given careful thought clears up any doubt as to what it is that the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> is really saying. It is important to understand that this is not a simile about the coming into existence of the sheaves of reeds. In the simile the sheaves of reeds already exist. The simile is about the ability of the two sheaves of reeds to stand upright only insofar as they are supported by one another. We are here given insight into the meaning of the term <a id="paccaya">'paccaya',</a> that is, that it means to lean on, support, or to be depended on. (Also, Bhk. Thanissaro's 'requisite condition') Here: 'supported by birth is aging and death' or 'depending on birth is aging and death'. This pretty much fundamentally changes all previous translations of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> that ... support the idea of creation or cause. I have used dependence, but also 'result' which is not quite correct and which I will as time and opportunity allows alter throughout this site to conform with this more precise understanding. Some persons are brought to understanding through similes.<br />

					Venerable Savittha questions the Venerable Musila about whether or not apart from belief, inclination, hearsay, argument as to method, reflection on and approval of an opinion, he has, as his very own, the knowledge of the various steps of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> and of the knowledge that the ending of becoming is <i>Nibbāna.</i> In all cases he states that he has such knowldge. And when the Venerable Savittha declares him an <i>arahant</i> he remains silent. Then the Venerable Narada, who has overheard this dialogue asks that the same questions be asked of him and when asked he responds in the same way. But when Savittha pronounces him too an arahant, Narada explains that while he has personal knowledge of these things, he has not attained them. And he gives the simile of the thirsty man who comes across a well with no means to retrieve the water.<br />
					It is an interesting mystery here as to what exactly Narada has accomplished. Has he just made the fact known that it is possible to know and see the goal without having achieved it, or is he making some statement concerning Musila's attainment and Savittha's understanding of what constitutes arahantship? Ānanda, who is present during this dialogue makes a statement which seems to point to the latter case.<br />
					Mrs. Rhys Davids translates <i>'bhava'</i> as 'becoming' which is not incorrect, but in its place in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> it has more to do with the potential for being such and such a sort of so and so in some place of being, rather than the process of becoming such. Elsewhere she objects strenuously to the statement that the ending of becoming is <i>Nibbāna</i> as her whole position is that the Buddha's doctrine is the teaching of an on-going becoming. But this misses the point of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> which defines being as a matter of blindness to the fact that personal identification with acts intended to create the experience of being result in Pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">H: <i>"Isn't the Buddha-Dhamma an attempt to explain the nature of existence — If the Buddhadhamma is doing this "background" stuff, why shouldn't we do the same?"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is a simile for the attitude that one must know the nature of existence before attempting to solve the problem of the pain associated with existence: The simile of the man shot with a poison arrow who demands to know who shot the arrow, what sort of poison was used, the wood used for the shaft, etc. before he will allow the doctor to treat the wound.</p>

					<p class="f4">For most people, death, whether one's own or experienced in reaction to the deaths of others does not really seem to strike home as a sufficient reason to fear life. Further there is at work in this a disbelief (as contrasted to an open mind) in rebirth and without that the full impact of <i>Dukkha</i> cannot be comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the reality in this case is that without this awareness of <i>'dukkha'</i> as it really is one has no motivation to understand the reasons for the Buddha's practices beyond those that yield beneficial results in terms of worldly life (giving, the respect of men for ethical behavior and self-control). In other words, no one can <i>make</i> you understand the doctrine. There is no logical reasoning that will bring about what must be a gut feeling in reaction to seeing pain as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Buddhism can only be understood as a solution to this problem of <i>dukkha.</i> If one does not even acknowledge the problem of <i>dukkha</i> as the underlying reason people seek God or answers to the issues of existence and non-existence, there is nothing further to be done until this issue ripens into this perspective.</p>

					<p class="f4">To say: "Isn't the Buddha-Dhamma an attempt to explain the nature of existence"; and then: "If the Buddhadhamma is doing this "background" stuff, why shouldn't we do the same?" is to ignore the fact that again and again this issue has come up and been explained in exactly the opposite way:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the past and now I teach <i>Dhamma</i> only for the ending of pain."</p>

					<p class="f4">And all the thousands of words concerning the so-called questions that Gotama would not answer are all this very issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">All those questions are the questions of people who want to know the nature of existence: 'Is it?', 'Is it not?' 'Is one conscious after death?' 'Does one have form after death?' and all the rest of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.01.3.olds.bd_dhamma_1.htm">the 64 generic ways</a> people struggle to pin down the nature of existence in the past, in the future and here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked about the nature of existence, Gotama either states that he has no opinion on the matter, or if the question is put properly:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, then, Good Gotama, does the Good Gotama hold?"</p>

					<p class="f4">he responds with the <i>paṭicca samuppāda:</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Avijja.</i> Blindness. Existence depends on ignorance of pain, the way pain arises, the way pain is brought to an end and the way to do it which is the <a href="../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">path of intentional not-doings;</a> (The problem is to recognize one's self in this and see that one who insists on understanding the nature of existence before tackling the solution to the problem of pain has a completely upside down misunderstanding of what Gotama taught and why he taught it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the least this must suggest that one should abstain from declarations of what the Buddha taught and then using what is in fact one's own speculative opinion as the basis for further conclusions about what the Buddha suggests.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Saṅkhāra:</i> Ignorance results in identifying with acts of thought, word and body intended to create personal existence</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā/nāma-rūpa:</i> identification with acts of thought, word and body intended to create personal existence results in identification with consciousness of named forms;<br />
					identification with consciousness of named forms is the conscious awareness of existence identified with the six senses;<br />
					the sensations that arise from the contact of the six senses with their sense-objects;<br />
					<i>Taṇhā:</i> the hunger and thirst for re-experience of existence that arise from the sensations arising from sense experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fuel feeding the impulse to act identifying with thoughts, words and deeds intended to create personal existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Acting in this way re-creates the personal world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This <i>is</i> the 'nature of existence'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is as far as it can be explained without going into error.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has nothing to do with 'it is' or 'it is not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as one tries to push it into that construction one has split the totality of it into opposing factions none of which can possibly be the whole truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even when one tries to put the both sides together as with: 'it both is and is not' what one has done is to speak of two separate non-coexistent incompatible points of view as one unified point of view which is just to put that point of view into opposition with the two points of view from which it was formed and also into opposition with the opposite of that which is that it neither exists nor does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is a futile endeavor and is hanging on to the belief that one or another of these ways of seeing things is the "Truth", that is at the root of all the evil in the world. And that, that is, the force of evil, is what one becomes, insisting on adherence to a point of view.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is for that reason that one tackles the problem of pain in existence before trying to understand the nature of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Look at the Four Truths: Is there anything there that says: "First we determine the nature of existence and then we tackle the problem of pain? No. The first truth is recognition that 'This' (whatever) is Pain. This, the ultimate doctrine of Buddhism begins and ends with the issue of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Look at <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">the first sutta</a> where Gotama's very first instruction to his very first disciples is: avoiding the path of self indulgence and avoiding the path of self-mortification go up the path that is the four truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">The path of self-indulgence is the path defined by those who hold that the self does not exist (eat drink and make Mary for tomorrow we die). The path of self-mortification has its origin in the view that the self does exist (and its evil impulses inspired by the devil must be suppressed).</p>

					<p class="f4">These two forms of behavior are the ultimate expressions of those points of view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither of these two points of view end Pain, hence they are said to be pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is no taking one side or the other without setting rolling the impulse which eventually takes one to the ultimate expression of a point of view. Its the nature of mind. It pursues every idea to its conclusion. This is why the Buddha says that holding wrong view ends in one of two results: in rebirth in hell or in one or another of the sub-human states such as as a daemon or as a ghost or as an animal. You either recognize this with your mind and struggle to escape or you go with the flow. The escape is what Gotama teaches.</p>

					<p class="f4">To say that knowing this (settling in one's mind on some one or another speculative conclusion), which one in fact does not 'know' (it has no more substance than the faith in God), and which one cannot know because it is not a real thing and does not describe things the way they are, allows one to let go of concerns about 'self' and focus on concerns relating to the problem of pain is just deceiving one's self. Look at that argument.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since one has not actually achieved the former how could one know that the latter is the result of such knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">The problem of pain is the problem of concerns about one's self. This <i>Dhamma</i> is reality based. We do not concern ourselves with pain as an abstract concept. It is a matter of personal concern. It is a matter of the pain of sickness and death in this life and re-birth leading to sickness and death in the next. Personal Pain. It is personal pain even in the case of these pains occurring to others. Compassion and sympathy and empathy are all based on the awareness of the (selfish) pain experienced by the self at the sufferings of others. Until one is free from the self altogether, its all about the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting the order of priorities the other way around is having to know all about the arrow and its maker before treating the poison and its effects: you never get there. The nature of existence (seeing the  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> ) cannot be seen before the solution to the problem of pain is seen. Intellectual understanding does not produce motivation to actually accomplish the fact of ending pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This mental attitude is understandable. We all take this position initially. But it is insane. The difference for the Buddhist is in the ability to recognize that the position is a result of fear of annihilation and to a lesser extent the fear of punishment for the guilt of existing and causing existence. The Buddhist recognizes that he is insane and takes steps to become sane.</p>

					<p class="f4">Opening the eyes what first greets the eye is the impersonality of not existing in the world. It appears to be unbearable. But it is not the impersonality of not existing in the world that is unbearable. That fear is just a reflection of the intuitive knowledge that this world itself is of that same impersonal nature. The comradery of man is an illusion. What is unbearable is to see that having adopted sense-existence as a solution to impersonality has resulted in endless pain back to the beginning of Time and will result in endless pain down through Endless Time in the future and is a moan <i>[om]</i> of pain in the present and on top of all that has not resulted in the comradery of man that one wished for.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one can recognize that the struggle to confirm existence in some form or another is a matter of personal fear of non-existence, then one can view this as a personal weakness. Then, with what may be no better than desperate hope that there is some escape, one can adopt Gotama's system on a try-it-and-see basis rather than both pretending that you understand it and arguing with it tooth and nail.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thing is to try it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This means, for example, with the understanding that ethical behavior is a matter of not-doing,<br />
					that you notice when you are tempted to say what you do not know,<br />
					and you do not say what you do not know;<br />
					or injure a living thing,<br />
					and you do not injure that living thing;<br />
					or take some thing that has not been given to you,<br />
					and you do not take that thing that has not been given to you;<br />
					or engage in a sensual indulgence at the expense of some aspect of your ethical standards,<br />
					and you do not engage in that sensual indulgence;<br />
					that you notice and make conscious to yourself the fact that you are aware that you will not experience the consequence of that breach of your ethical standards.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have noted and made conscious to yourself the fact that you will not experience the consequence of what would have been a breach of your ethical standards,<br />
					you then need to recognize that this is a freedom from pain,<br />
					and that that freedom from pain is not dependent on sense-experience,<br />
					that it is, in fact, dependent on not indulging in sense-experience,<br />
					and that that state of being free<br />
					is the state of impersonality you previously feared<br />
					and that it is not fearful at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is also the knowledge that the pain you have avoided is of the same nature as the pain associated with all sense-existence and that it is that that is the real fear you feel when you contemplate annihilation.</p>

					<p class="f4">This freedom from that fear is the freedom promised by Gotama that you have been seeking.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is one proof to you that Gotama's system works.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having that one proof you can argue with your fearful self that a second trial is in order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enough trials will form the basis for a stronger faith and greater effort and you will have set rolling a benevolent cycle which leads inevitably to ultimate freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">H: <i>I don't think that knowing (seeing) that the self both exists and does not exist is necessarily a theory. The distinction, it seems to me, is whether one "sees," in which case it is not a theory, or whether one is only aware of this conceptually.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">OBO: To see that it is not possible to see that a thing exists or does not exist and that therefore any belief or statement that one knows and sees that a thing exists or does not exist is self-deception based on a theory or conclusion one has reached with regard to what one has perceived at the senses:</p>

					<p class="f4">First acknowledge that to see the nature of a thing one must first see that thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then look at the process of perception through the senses: An object comes into contact with an organ of sense and sense-consciousness arises. Visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, consciousness of smell, taste, touch and ideas are the sense-objects of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind takes sense-consciousnesses and forms an image in the mind of an object. This image is then woven into the individual's world of existing things and it is mistakenly believed to be being directly perceived in that world. It is not being directly perceived. What the individual sees is an imaginary construction. And it may or may not have anything to do with a real object in the world. There are demonstrations galore in the world of psychology that show that perception is highly selective and often completely erroneous.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the first thing to realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then examining a thing as perceived, note that there is no point in time or space where that thing is static. Down to the atomic level and below things are in constant flux; sensations, mental states, and ideas are in constant flux. A thing is a thing in the world strictly as a matter of a consensual acceptance of a name placed on a moving target.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for these reasons that one is not able to state, based on perception or reason, that a thing has any real existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other side, Gotama refused to state that the self does not exist because in the consensual reality a thing is said to exist. There is no denying the consensual reality, the subjective reality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further it cannot be said that a thing both exists and does not exist because the basic requirement of that statement is that the thing exists. We have shown, and it can be seen, that this is not a valid conclusion about what is there: from either side of the statement the other side is incorrect. To say that it is both things simultaneously is to claim to be able to see what one cannot see or to admit that one is not able to directly perceive the existence or non-existence of a thing and that what one is saying is valid only as a consensus name.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again it cannot be said that a thing neither exists nor does not exist because the basic requirement of that statement is that the thing does not exist. And again we have shown, and it can be seen, that this is not a valid conclusion about what is there: from either side of the statement the other side is incorrect. To say that it is both things simultaneously is to claim to be able to see what one cannot see or is to admit that one is not able to directly perceive the existence or non-existence of a thing and that what one is saying is valid only as a consensus name.</p>

					<p class="f4">The claim that one has directly perceived the reality of any statement concerning existence or non-existence of things is mistaking consensus name with direct seeing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="in2 g">OBO: The result, when the last of an individual's already-set-rolling sense-experiences are used up or abandoned, is sensation, perception, and consciousness outside of the senses. The sensation is the sensation that arises from not-doing existence, or sensation that is neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Perception and consciousness are entirely devoid of ideas of self or ownership.</p>

					<p class="f4">H: <i>For me, as you have explained It above, the not-doing existence which results from "seeing" directly, when the nature of the ego self is seen as a fiction, does one come [Edit: amounts to?] to a not-doing existence. Resting there, one can deal with the existence of pain, by asking "existence questions" like What is pain, how is it caused, how is it stopped, and how to go about stopping it. Dealing with the existence of pain successfully seems to require a host of other questions which delve into the nature of pain. The Buddha has done this for us, but without following his thinking here (thinking about existence questions) we would be unable to successfully deal with the existence of pain as he understood it.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">OBO: This is the problem with tackling understanding strictly through the intellect. There is no attaining the final result of not-doing existence, or <i>Nibbāna</i> without first having solved the problem of pain by abandoning (not just knowing and seeing) all that which is related to self.</p>

					<p class="f4">The construction of your statement shows the fact that you conceive this state as being one which is attained by a self thus rendering your argument 'self'-contradictory. And it is in fact not a correct perception of the method.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not necessary to solve the problem of pain by delving into the nature of pain. It is necessary only to see that ending is built into the idea of existence and it is not the intent of the individual seeking existence to be experiencing endings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In fact, it is not even necessary to have seen this much if one has an adventurous enough spirit to tackle the problem blindly. All that is needed is a willingness to experiment. As described earlier in the thread, one trial with not-doing, carefully examined for the results, will show the nature of the whole process. Insight is a result. Wisdom is a result of numerous insights. One does not pursue insight and wisdom by directly pursuing insight and wisdom. One pursues insight and wisdom by engaging in trial and error based on a thesis aimed at solving a problem.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the thesis, or working hypothesis, is the Four Truths. The nature of the Four Truths, as a thesis, is not the same as the thesis: 'It is'. The Four Truths do not engage in the discussion of existence and non-existence. The Four Truths is a thesis that is aimed at a specific problem which, when solved, results in the abandoning of the thesis.</p>

					<p class="f4">The difference is that theories of existence and non-existence do not allow of abandoning; whereas the Four Truths is the use of theory to abandon theorizing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">H: <i>I see no contradiction in having ideas of self, which are seen as false, and having a consciousness which is devoid of these ideas of self.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Exactly. You see no contradiction there. This is a result of living in the intellect. What you are saying is that there is no difference between a man sitting down to a meal and one imagining sitting down to a meal. That second man, if he does not give up that idea that there is no difference will soon enough starve to death.</p>

					The problem with Woodward's translation/conception of <i>jhāna</i> is his use of the term 'trance'. The <i>jhānas,</i> at a certain point definitely resemble or might as well be called trances, but the implication of the word distorts the reality. What these states are is wide-awake, fully conscious awareness of higher than ordinary states of reality. The word <i>'jhāna'</i> is the root of our word 'knowing' and it would be best to emphasize that aspect of <i>jhāna</i> over the fact that from the outside the individual highly concentrated in <i>jhāna</i> seems to be in a trance state. In later translations he uses the term 'musing' which is somewhat closer to what is happening.<br />
					I have pointed out in notes in and through my translation where I believe commentarial explanations have distorted the understanding of the first <i>jhāna.</i> The importance of this sutta is that it is being related by a master of the subject about the very beginning of his practice where he is, in theory at least, no more knowledgable about the subject than any beginner then or now. That this is an instruction for very beginners is the whole point of this sutta. So I think it is not unreasonable to state that the teaching should be taken at face value. In addition, supporting the idea that this is an instruction that if followed brings the promised result (the getting a grip on the first <i>jhāna</i>) the Buddha's private instruction to Moggallāna is also brought to bear on the subject. What is needed to be understood about the subject is said, no more, no less.<br />
					Because there is doubt surrounding the idea that the <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for full practice of Gotama's system, and where it is also clear that, push come to shove, the first <i>jhāna</i> will do, it is essential that any serious practitioner come to grips with what is required for this attainment. Here is the rulebook. There is the <i>Pāḷi</i> and three translations. Dig in!<br />
					Speaking of which, there are those out there that have gone out on a limb and dug himself into a pit stating in no undertain terms that it is impossible, and ridiculing the idea, that there is thinking in the first <i>jhāna.</i> Take a look at the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Just before Moggallāna recalls the formula for the first <i>jhāna,</i> — <i>before</i> he has entered the first <i>jhāna,</i> — in which is found the terms <i>'sa-vitakka'</i> and <i>'sa-vicāra'</i> (my 'with thinking, with pondering', Woodward's 'accompanied by thought directed and sustained', Bhk. Bodhi's 'accompanied by thought and examination') he states that he has been <i>'pari-vitakka'</i>-ing about the meaning of the term 'The First Knowing'. <i>Pari-vitakka:</i> 'Thinking about.' If these terms meant something other than the ordinary understanding of them, to avoid confusion here some distinction would need to be made concering their use in the one case and their use in the other. But in stead we have what is actually an emphasis on the idea that these terms are to be understood in the ordinary way by the use of the prefix: <i>'sa-',</i> 'with.'<br />
					The <i>jhānas</i> are a progression of detachments. "The attaining of one state by the letting go of another." (Sāriputta). One begins by letting go of the rough worldly-bound diversions known as the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">Nivaranas.</a> That does not include all thinking. We need some stepping stone to the point of even greater detachment wherein there is no thinking (the second knowing): a place where we are able to clearly think and ponder over the <i>Dhamma.</i> That is the first knowing. This is something the layman is frequently described as being able to attain without a great deal of labor. You can do it! Do not listen to those who say it cannot be done!<br />

					Most of the remarks regarding the previous sutta apply also to this one. With regard specifically to the second <i>jhāna</i> is my objection to translating the word <i>'samādhi'</i> as concentration. <i>Samādhi</i> is not just concentration, it is the serene state of one who has developed the whole spectrum of attainments from giving to ethical conduct to self-control to development of mind and the factors as described within the <i>jhānas,</i> and characterized by the individual having no ambitions, having no sign of lust, hate or ignorance, and being empty of lust, hate and ignorance. In the first and second <i>jhāna samādhi</i> is only just beginning its higher development.<br />

					Woodward has for <i>Upekkhā-sati-pārisuddhiṃ.</i> <i>"a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity,"</i> which either ignores <i>'sati'</i> or (unlikely) translates it as 'balance.' I argue that <i>'upekkhā',</i> usually translated 'equanimity' should be translated 'detachment'. PED: "looking on", hedonic neutrality or indifference, zero point between joy and sorrow ... disinterestedness, neutral feeling, equanimity. Sometimes equivalent to <i>adukkha-m-asukha-vedanā</i> "feeling which is neither pain nor pleasure". (Which is the <i>'vedanā'</i> of the Arahant, or the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna.</i> — <i>'Upekkhā'</i> is also the equivalent of <i>'vimutti',</i> 'freedom,' which is also the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna.</i>) I except "equanimity". Equanimity is a state of impassivity which is a precurser to detachment (see the Sixth <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">Sambojjhanga</a>) and is a state which is still involved with the world.

					Moggallāna, one of the two most powerful of the Buddha's followers, and the one whose strong point was magic power, describes his first attempts to master the the level of meditation practice called Signless Serenity of Heart.<br />
					Still another term translated 'conditioned'. So when you see this word you need to look up the <i>Pāḷi.</i> If it is <i>'Nidāna'</i> it means 'tied to' 'bound up with'; if it is <i>'paṭicca'</i> it means 'depending on', if it is <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> it means 'own-made or constructed' if it is <i>'nimitta'</i> it means 'signs, signatures, marks'. 'The Unconditioned' is also the mistranslation used to describe <i>Nibbāna,</i> and the Signless is not yet <i>Nibbāna.</i> Bhk. Bodhi: 'signless concentration of mind'. What signs does one not dwell on? Pleasant or unpleasant features of things. The idea is not non-perception of objects, it is the state arrived at when not dwelling on the pleasant or unpleasant features of objects to the extent that lust, hate, or delusion arises. Lust, Hate and Delusion leave signs so the state arrived at is one in which no signs of these things are left. And that doesn't mean one covers one's tracks well, it means one leaves no track because those things do not exist in one there!)<br />

					As far as I am concerned there is no longer any doubt that these long repetititititive suttas at the conclusion of chapters are genuine hypnotic spells constructed to be delivered in full and which result in transporting the mind of the listener into higher dimensions.

					This should probably be 5 different Suttas, each identical to SN 4.40.10 with only the name of the <i>deva</i> changed. This is represented in the <i>Pāḷi</i> only by the names of the <i>devas</i> and an indication that the previous sutta should be repeated with changes.

					<p class="f4">For the accomplishment of knowledge and insight it is necessary to be energetic. Right on up to the point of achieving Arahantship there will be an energy-consuming effort to end bad habits that are present in one, prevent bad habits that are not yet present, acquire good habits that are not yet present and retain good habits that are present. Even the <i>jhānas,</i> which in theory require less energy than sleep, will require an enormous struggle with bad habits of body and mind before any lasting success at entering them can be expected. Energy is not acquired by eating more energy-producing food. Energy is acquired by the expenditure of energy in ending bad energy wasting habits that are present in one, preventing bad energy wasting habits that are not yet present, acquiring good energy-conserving habits that are not yet present and retaining good energy-conserving habits that are present. This is a way of saying that what is required is a re-organization of one's energy allocations. Two areas where energy is commonly mis-deployed and can be usefully re-allocated are food consumption and sleep.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you notice you are putting on weight in the form of fat, you are eating more than your body needs to produce the energy required to accomplish what needs to be accomplished by the body during the day: you are wasting energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Energy is being wasted on the expense of the wasted food. Energy is being expended in the digestion of the surplus food. Energy is being expended in the storage and management of the extra nutrients (fat). The body is expending extra energy in carrying around the extra weight. Consuming more food than the body needs to produce the energy required to accomplish what needs to be accomplished by the body during the day results in fatigue. Feeling fatigue one sleeps or dozes or passes time in a daze. This is not helpful in attaining knowledge and insight. Sleep, beyond what the body needs to restore the alertness of the mind to accomplish what needs to be accomplished by the body during the day is a waste of valuable time that could be used for ending bad habits that are present in one, preventing bad habits that are not yet present, acquiring good habits that are not yet present and retaining good habits that are present. At the onset of fatigue, before stored energy is used, the body indicates a need for extra energy in the form of desire to eat. Acting on that desire is the fueling of the activities of the body that result from consuming more food than your body needs to produce the energy required to accomplish what needs to be accomplished by the body during the day, and not only does not consume previously stored nutrients, but adds to the storage burden. Noticing the burden (you see you are getting fat) and resorting to exercise is the addition of extra energy consuming activity to the daily routine, results in additional demands for nutrients to support that new activity which creates a completely useless energy-consuming cycle and does nothing to add to the energy supply or time needed to develop knowledge and insight. If unnecessary exercise does result in a healthy-appearing body, it will also result in the need to maintain that level of activity (and thereby reduce by that much time over time the time one could be using to develop knowledge and insight) and the result of that will be a habit of consumption of food based on that higher level of activity and should there come a time when that exercise is no longer possible or desirable, the consequence will be energy-consuming and mentally disturbing fatty flab. To bring the consumption of food down to the non-useless-exercise level is the same task as would be required to cut down on the original level of over-consumption that resulted in the overweight that resulted in the exercise in the first place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consumption of energy stimulants (herbs, pills, powders, caffeinated drinks) work by combining a draw-down on emergency energy supplies (by stimulating adrenalin production) and the suppression of the appetite that results in consuming more food than your body needs to produce the energy required to accomplish what needs to be accomplished by the body during the day and the result of that in fatigue. This is the left hand stealing from the right hand. What goes up must come down. If this artificial energy boost is used productively, the knowledge and insight gained will be that the habit of using energy stimulants is a hindrance to further knowledge and insight and will need to be eliminated. Back to square one.</p>

					<p class="f4">We say nothing here about the danger to the quest for knowledge and insight that the danger that extra weight poses to the health of the body creates, including the time, energy and expense (and the time and energy expended in acquiring the funds to meet those expenses) consumed in battling disease caused by being overweight and of slothful habits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Part of knowledge and insight is recognizing where we are behaving like a fool and eliminating those behaviors.</p>

					Gotama instructs a group of ascetics on the way to bring the ascetic practice to its highest perfection.<br />
					This is a rare case where the Buddha, even after making an heroic effort fails utterly. This is also a sutta which shows the absolutely vital role repetition plays in the suttas. This was a spell which was designed to bring a group of committed ascetics step-by-step to the topmost peak of <i>their</i> discipline with the intent of bringing them, <i>from that point, over to Gotama's system.</i> It worked as far as bringing the group to their highest development, but failed to bring them across. If you even just read this sutta and wake up at those points where you want to skip the repetition and make yourself conscious that it is exactly at these points where the sutta takes one into a higher dimension, then this sutta has the potential to deliver one a view of infinity. I would love to hear this one given by an old-time black broad-brim hat, fire and brimstone preacher man, circa 1770s (or even of today in some places in the S.E. USA). A real masterpiece.<br />

					The challenge for the reader is to see how the venerable Sāriputta's defense is reasonable.

					The Buddha gives the <i>bhikkhus</i> a full curriculum for the realization of <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					This sutta presents the descriptions of the <i>jhānas</i> together with similes for each. [see also for these: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p28">AN 5.28,</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2,</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77">MN 77</a>] These similes are very helpful when it comes to the subjective judgment as to one's attainment of the <i>jhāna.</i> You should be able to see in what is happening in your own body the exact parallel with the simile.<br />
					It is significant that the terms used to indicate the way the <i>jhāna</i> is to be cultivated change at the fourth <i>jhāna.</i> There is an internal parallel within these terms between them and the similes which should be reflected in their degree and order. Again, the idea is of a progression in degree of wetness. Here from wetting dry soapflakes to the total immersion of the flowering lotus. These 'wettings' apply with regard to pleasant sensations from the first to the third <i>jhāna.</i> Entering the fourth <i>jhāna</i> requires that these sensations be let go, and the simile is a dry image characterized by the idea of purity, cleanliness, and a stationary posture.<br />
					PED's definitions vaguely hint at the idea of progressive saturation.<br />
					So for the similes, the progression is: first a wetting, second a penetrating injection, third a flowering in total immersion, and fourth a dry image which suggests a view detached from the completely encompassed body which in turn suggests that the idea may be more of an objective view of what is happening to the body than the subjective view being implied by the terms indicating how the first three <i>jhāna</i> are to be cultivated.<br />
					Done properly the result should be a dual progression from the point of first attaining to the first <i>jhāna</i> to the point where it can be abandoned, to the point of first attaining the third <i>jhāna</i> to the point where it can be abandoned, to the point where by abandoning the third <i>jhāna</i> one emerges from the wetness by abandoning the totally encompassed body altogether. Or stated another way: from <i>jhāna</i> to deeper into the <i>jhāna</i> and from <i>jhāna</i> to <i>jhāna.</i> To the end of making this more evident in the terms, the following new translations are suggested here:</p>

Recollect down to the smallest details all the surroundings (follow the instructions for <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#body">minding the body</a> in the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i>), all the <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#body">sensations</a> experienced, the <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#heart">mental/emotional states</a> that occurred reviewing all through the lens of <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#dhamma">the <i>Dhamma</i> as found at the end of the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.</i></a> As you call this person to mind, <i><b>breath in penetrating knowledge (comprehension and awareness of the details) and breath out release from any tension you notice connected with the recollection.</b></i> Do this again and again with each person on the list to the point of <i>satisfaction:</i> where there is no content in your memory of this person that is a mystery or which arouses pleasant or unpleasant sensations or mental states reflecting anything other than complete objective detachment. To the point where there is no wishing or wanting whatsoever connected with this person. You will know when this has been accomplished by attention to the breathing. Initially there will be a deep exhalation which will be clearly seen as a release of tension ("a sigh of relief") followed by smoothness of breathing. When the breath is completely free of disturbance you have liberated the energy locked up in the memory of this person.</p>

					<p>This will be a life-long exercise. The practice is expanded by adding new categories to be recapitulated: <i>e.g.,</i> dwellings, cities, countries, jobs, illnesses, clothing, food, books, movies and any other thing that may have trapped one's attention.</p>

					<p>This practice is completely encompassed by the four settings-up of mind <i>[satipaṭṭhāna].</i> This presentation in specific terms is not a statement that this is the entire scope of the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice. It is just one exercise within it which I have personally used and found very helpful with results that are both swift and are easily seen to strenthen the memory, release energy and bring progress towards the goal of objective detachment.</p>

					<p>The same non-carelessness holds for the Recapitulation practice of Don Juan. This is only the beginning practice in a very complex system.</p>

					<p>Don Juan's breathing practice is different than that used in the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> technique. In his practice one synchronizes the in-breath with a smooth movement of the head from right to left, inhaling, as with the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> technique, penetrating knowledge of what has been visualized; and again synchronizing the out-breath with a smooth movement of the head from left to right expelling all attachment to the visualized object. At the point where the breath is smooth and detachment is clear, the head is moved rapidly but smoothly to the right and left without breathing in a jesture of closure and dismissal of any futher attachment to the object in the future. This involves intentional movements of the body which are not consistent with the later developments in the Buddhist Practice, but in that the technique is effective, it might be adopted in the interum with the intent that as practice becomes perfected the 'sweeping' movements of the head and the jesture of closure will be done mentally.</p>

					<p>Note that there is an important distinction between the ordinary way we reminisce about the past and and 'remembering or recapitulting a episode from the past'. Reminiscing is recalling the events of the past and re-living them with the mind-set of the present. The job of recapitulation, the task that will free-up energy tied up in past situations, is to recollect the sensations and perceptions that were present and being experienced by one in the past situation.</p>

					<p>Further, it is my experience that there are multiple levels of perception which will come to bear on the various objects of examanation. A person who may have been seen as having been of little importance at one level will, at a later time be seen as pivotal to very important later developments. Therefore in the act of dismissal one should not incororporate the intent that this object will never be revisited again. Attachment at a certain level is dismissed while alowing that one might not yet have seen the whole picture.</p>

					The Buddha outlines the progressive interdependence of ethical behavior, serenity, knowing and seeing, disenchantment and dispassion, and knowing and seeing freedom. Hare who previously used 'insight' for '<i>paññā,'</i> 'wisdom' here uses 'insight' for <i>'dassana,'</i> seeing, so it is necessary to discover which he is referring to when you encounter this term in his translations. He has translated the final step, <i>'vimutti-ñāṇa-dassana'</i> 'emancipated knowledge and insight.' Bhk. Bodhi (I believe more correctly) here has: 'knowledge and vision of liberation.' Where having known and seen freedom as freedom does result in emancipated knowledge and freedom, what is being spoken of in this sutta is the consequence of having dispassion and disenchantment. The immediate result of that is knowing and seeing freedom. It is not sufficient to attain freedom. One must know that one is free and know that this freedom is the freedom one has been seeking. Otherwise there will be nothing to prevent recrudescence of existence and birth. The earlier 'knowing and seeing' is the knowing and seeing of the Four Truths or the seeing of and approval of the theory, an achievement of the Streamwinner.<br />

					Consummate <i>Samādhi</i> described as consisting of five dimensions (the four usual <i>jhānas</i> and observation of the sign) and yielding skill in the higher knowledges.<br />
					This description of the <i>jhānas</i> has with it the similes which are very helpful in visualizing the progression of the <i>jhānas.</i>
					[see also for these: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2,</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p39">MN 39,</a><a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77">MN 77</a>]
					However this translation reflects neither vision nor a close adherence to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and messes up the imagry to the point of uselessness. Hare has especially botched up the simile for the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> and to complicate that either he has translated it backwards or there was an editorial error which reverses the meaning. The descriptions of the <i>jhānas</i> and the similes that accompany them are not simply descriptions or recipes, they are also hypnotic suggestions which draw one into the <i>jhāna.</i> All their magic is lost if the repeated phrases are not repeated exactly and if the ordering of the words does not reflect the progressive deepening of the experience. See <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#first_burning">'The First Burning'</a> and following for my version.<br />
					In this sutta the fifth item (observing the sign) is one that is not seen elsewhere connected with <i>sammā samādhi</i> or the mastery of higher powers and its meaning here is subject to question. There is no support in the sutta itself for the idea that this is paying attention to a concentration device, or the so called 'reflex image,' or to the subject of one's meditation. I believe the key is in the simile which is of a man observing another man while standing, observing while standing another man who is sitting, and sitting observing another man who is lying down. I believe what is being observed is the body and its state of serenity and that there is, in the idea of 'a man', a symbolic imagry for mnemonic purposes which is humorous. Note that the final, always the highest state, is supine.<br />
					[Edit: at a much later point I have come to the conclusion that what 'signs' refer to is anything that happens to one as one enters <i>samādhi</i> such that it can be used for later recognition that one is entering such. Commentary would have the sign be perception of the skeleton, and that is open to the question of whether this is perception in the mind's eye (a vision), or the perception had during contemplation of the foul as in the cemetery contemplations where one concludes that one's own body has not overcome that state of things. Take your pick or use them all.]

					The Buddha explains to his attendant Nāgita why he will not accept the food-gifts of a large number of people who have gathered together to do him homage on hearing of his arival in their town.<br />
					It is interesting to try and understand the reasoning here as elsewhere the Buddha goes to great lengths to encourage giving. The distinction appears to be that these people have not arrived to hear <i>Dhamma,</i> but only to 'see' the Buddha and make merit by giving their gifts.<br />
					The key word to understand in this sutta is <i>samāgama.</i> Hare: 'homage'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'honor'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'fame', PED: 'intercourse. <i>saṇ</i> = own, with, con; <i>āgama</i> = to cause to come. In the text Gotama indicates that it is a word for gains, honors, and fame. I think 'homage' covers more of this territory than 'honor' or 'fame.' Gotama apparently perceives the motives of the group as consisting of empty homage.<br />
					We know from the fact that Nāgita was at this time Gotama's attendant, that this is an early event, so this supports the idea that in the early stages of the Buddha's career the meditation practice of choice was apparently the contemplation of the unpleasant and the disadvantages of existence rather than minding the breathing.<br />
					We don't know much about Nāgita except that he was supposed to have been fat and lazy. See also: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p42">AN 6.42</a> and <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p86">AN 8.86</a><br />

					Uggaha invites the Buddha to a meal to instruct his daughters in the behavior that will profit them in this life and the life hereafter.<br />
					This is one all women should read and take to heart. I suggest reading it keeping in mind its framework: There was a general belief in <i>kamma</i> at the time and where there is a belief in <i>kamma</i> the emphasis is on one's behavior, not on where in the pecking order one is located. However it came about there was a belief at the time that women belonged in the kitchen and were subserviant to their husbands. Consequently the Buddha's advice to these girls would be such as would, if followed, result in the best outcome in terms of <i>kamma.</i> Believing in <i>kamma,</i> fighting for equality rather than directing one's energies to the perfecting of one's role as fated by one's <i>kamma</i> and making good <i>kamma,</i> results in bad <i>kamma.</i> Take a look. Its fighting. Complaining. Resisting. Argument and contention. Angry emotions and hateful thoughts, words, and deeds.<br />
					Everyone who believes they believe in the teachings of the Buddha would be well to think about their reactions to this issue. The difference is in seeing injustice versus fighting for justice. Fighting for justice in any other way than by being a good example and by explaining matters with compassion for all is an indication that one does not understand/believe in <i>kamma.</i> If one does not understand <i>kamma,</i>  one does not understand the point of the Buddha's teachings. Not understanding one will hold opinions about suttas like this which will amount to thinking that the Buddha did not know what he was talking about or doing. Holding such opinions one will make statements to that effect and the result of that will not only be bad <i>kamma</i> for one's self but will also be leading other people astray.<br />

					Hare quotes the Commentary: living a generous, ethical life guided by wisdom. Elsewhere in the suttas themselves long life is said to be got through harmlessness, beauty through being good tempered, honor through non-envy and respect of others, and rebirth in heaven through giving and mental culture. Generosity alone is also mentioned as yielding all these results. And wisdom would guide one to doing all these things if for no other reason than covering one's bets.<br />

					Pasenadi, king of Kosala is visiting the Buddha when he is told of the death of his chief Queen, Mallika. He is very upset and Gotama instructs him with the distinction between the disciples of Gotama and the commoner in facing aging, sickness and death, passing away, and dissapearance.<br />
					The instruction is identical with the previous sutta. It is very difficult for us in the West to see how this sort of response to a person in grief could be understood as compassion. I have personally faced the situation and not been able to respond as directly as in this example. The best I could come up with was to say that "In the ancient system of the Buddha the response to a person in grief was to say something like 'It is the destiny of all personal things to come to an end.' And then explain that however much grief might be being felt, what it came down to was that this was not grief for the dead person, but grief for the self missing the companionship of the dead person, and that by letting go of this display of grief he would be saving himself useless and embarassing display of self-pity. The idea that the display of grief is a joy to one's enemies and a pain to one's friends is also a strong argument in this situation.<br />

					The Buddha likens a person mastered by wishing for sense pleasure, hate, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling, and doubt and vacillation (<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">the Nivaranas</a> — diversions) to a stream which has been diverted and no longer has its original strength or free will. Then he likens a person who has mastered desire for sense pleasures, hatred, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling and doubt and vacillation to a stream whose diversions have been closed off and which has regained its strength and free will.<br />
					Once again the simile points the way to the correct translation of <i>'nivarana',</i> that is, 'diversion' or that which diverts. The majority of translators use 'hindrance', but it can be seen from the simile that what is being spoken of is not an obstruction (another translation that has been used) but something that is syphoning off the forward momentum of the stream. I think we can see here a difference in the mentality of this day and age [USA, Sunday, July 13, 2014 11:47 AM A.D.] from that of the followers of Gotama in his day and age [c.500 B.C.], that is the tendency to put off our problems onto the world or others. That which obstructs does not involve the will of the individual or necessarily reduce his strength and freedom, whereas diversions are by their nature participated in by the individual and to whatever degree that is so weaken his strength and diminish his individual willpower.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.054.hare.pts.htm">Times for Striving,</a> the Hare translation,<br />
					The Buddha describes features of the seasonable and unseasonable time for making effort.<br />
					This is a discouraging sutta for these times and this old man. What can it mean that Gotama who is always so encouraging is here saying that there are times which are just no good for making effort? I believe what is being spoken of is better thought of as 'all-out effort' directed at attaining nothing less than arahantship as opposed to the home life where realistically the highest one can hope to attain is non-returning (arahantship for the layman is possible, but extraordinarily difficult to manage). For all out effort what is needed is a the complete, virtually unretrievable renunciation of one's worldly goods and the total dependence on one's <i>kamma.</i> Complete abandoning of every tie to the world. This is not going on retreat for two weeks on one's vacation. This is not even retiring into a monestary as they are set up today where one can count on one's food, cloting, medicine and shelter and the politics of monestary management. Think about what 'total renunciation' would mean here today. [USA, Tuesday, July 15, 2014 3:24 AM]. Step out into this land without money with only one set of cloths and a bowl and in all likelihood one would be in jail before nightfall. It isn't that people are not generous. I have seen people survive on the streets of New York for five years and more with the assistance of the antifreeze alcohol. But their's is a life of misery and endless fear and harassment. The people here are the most generous in the world, but there are also very many that are so intollerant or fearful of poverty that they are easily persuaded to act violently towards any person projecting an image of what can happen to them too should their flimsy supports dry up. To voluntarily jump into that fire would be to risk everything for a situation that would not be conduscive to serenity, methinks. And I think that it is this degree of commitment that is intended in this sutta, not the abandoning altogether of the quest. Again the seeker who begins the journey in old age is not only faced with the disagreeable effects that result from the giving up of old habits, but he must also face the continual unpleasantness of a body in decay. There are a number of cases in the suttas where those who have just started in old age have even attained arahantship, but the case with the better prognosis would be the one where in youth one got a running start so as to establish control over the mind before the onset of the painful decay of the body. So again I think in this case the ideas is the encouragement of the young to take advantage of their youth when that is possible more than the idea of discouraging the elderly from any idea of effort. Again, imagine attempting the life in places in Mexico where there are violent drug gangs kidnapping anyone with the least prospect of bringing in a ransom and murdering seemingly at random, a peaceful people in fear and suspicious of any abnormal behavior, and violent and corrupt vigilantes and police. Or think about becoming a beggar in one of those African countries continually plagued by famine. Do you have enough personal power to be able to assure yourself that food given to you is of more benifit to the giver than eating it himself? There are things that one faces in the highly sensitive state of one near starvation and without the assurance of conventional resources that can drive one mad. I think the advice given in this sutta can be seen not as discouragement but as a warning to those whose faith might lead them into taking useless action.</p>

					<p>[Florinda Donner is speaking with Isidoro Baltazar:] "Sorcerers," he went on, "make one see that the whole nature of reality is different from what we believe it to be; that is, from what we have been taught it to be. Intellectually, we are willing to tease ourselves with the idea that culture predetermines who we are, how we behave, what we are willing to know, what we are able to feel. But we are not willing to embody this idea, to accept it as a concrete, practical proposition. And the reason for that is that we are not willing to accept that culture also predetermines what we are able to perceive.</p>

					<p>"Sorcery makes us aware of different realities, different possibilities, not only about the world but also about ourselves, to the extent that we no longer are able to believe in even the most solid assumptions about ourselves and our surroundings."</p>

					<p>I was surprised that I could absorb his words so easily, when I didn't really understand them.</p>

					<p>"A sorcerer is not only aware of different realities," he went on, "but he uses that knowledge in practicalities. Sorcerers know — not only intellectually but also practically — that reality, or the world as we know it, consists only of an agreement extracted out of every one of us. That agreement could be made to collapse, since its only a social phenomenon. And when it collapses, the whole world collapses with it."</p>

					<p>Seeing that I couldn't follow his argument, he tried to present it from another angle. He said that the social world defines perception to us in proportion to its usefulness in guiding us through the complexity of experience in everyday life. The social world sets limits to what we perceive, sets limits to what we are capable of perceiving. "To a sorcerer, perception can go beyond these agreed-upon parameters," he stressed. "These parameters are constructed and buttressed by words, by language, by thoughts. That is, by agreement."</p>

					<p>"And sorcerers don't agree?" I asked tentatively, in an effort to understand his premise.</p>

					<p>"They do agree," he said, beaming at me, "but their agreement is different. Sorcerers break the normal agreement, not only intellectually but also physically or practically or whatever one wants to call it. Sorcerers collapse the parameters of socially determined perception, and to understand what sorcerers mean by that, one has to become a pracitioner. That is, one has to be committed; one has to lend the mind as well as the body. It has to be a conscious, fearless surrender."</p>

					An important sutta for underscoring the idea that the Buddha is not teaching by this doctrine ineffectivness of <i>kamma.</i> Many in a certain <i>dhamma</i> study group on the internet would benefit greatly in seeing this sutta and understanding its point. Many others would benefit greatly in understanding how easily very dangerous ideas can arise from not paying careful attention to what Gotama is actually teaching. The view that <i>kamma</i> is ineffectual was taught by a contemporary of Gotama named <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/makkhali_gosala.htm">Mikkhali,</a> and was called the most pernicious of man-traps. (PS: anyone who recognizes this group and would bring benefit to its members by showing them this sutta should do so with heightened wariness, careful crafting of his words, conscious compassion, complete suppression of any tendency to anger, and preparedness for a swift but dignified termination of the discussion when attacked. One can but give them the information, they must arrive at understanding on their own. They are heavily invested in their point of view.)<br />

					A variation on AN 4.232 above using <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">the Seven Dimensions of Awakening</a> for the <i>kamma</i> that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither dark nor bright, <i>kamma</i> that ends <i>kamma.</i><br />
					Note that this sutta (and similarly for the previous sutta the Eight Dimensional Way) is saying that the Seven Dimensions of Awakening is constructed of <i>intentional not-doings.</i> That includes <i>'Sati'</i> (recollection, memory, attention) and <i>'Samādhi'</i> (serenity). It is not too difficult to see that <i>'Samādhi'</i> is constructed of a series of abandonings, each higher state being attained not by 'getting' but by 'letting go of the previous state,' but how do we understand <i>'Sati'</i> to be intentional not-doing? Sati in this case is recollection of body, sensation, mental-states and things seen through the lens of <i>Dhamma</i> with the idea of observing how they come to be, are maintained, and come to an end with the further idea of becoming thoroughly objectively detached from them. The intentional not-doing is the not becomming attached or identified with such things as they come into awareness (or are recollected). Woodward and Mrs. Rhys Davids have both remarked how it must be a distortion of the system originally taught by Gotama that all virtues are negative ones (i.e., 'abstaining from'). This is the fact and it is an essential orientation required by anyone who would understand this system. The entire point of this series of suttas is that there is <i>kamma</i> which perpetuates <i>kamma</i> and living in the world and there is a sort of <i>kamma</i> which is the key to escaping <i>kamma</i> and that is intentionally not doing the sort of <i>kamma</i> that perpetuates <i>kamma</i> and living in the world. The Buddha's Methods always result in a good outcome, and on occasion and when asked Gotama does directly teach <i>kamma</i> that has positive worldly results (attaining beauty, wealth, health, long life, heavenly rebirth), but when the result is worldly gain, this is to be seen as a sort of failure in terms of the goal of his system ... a falling short of that which is higher and better.<br />

					The Buddha extols the benefits of fear of punishment using a comparison between the fear of worldly persons of the punishments of evil-doers in the world with the awareness of <i>bhikkhus</i> and <i>bhikkhunis</i> of the punishments of recalcitrant members of the Order.<br />
					An interesting view is given in this sutta of the behavior of at least a portion of the society with regard to guilty deeds. That is that the guilty volunteer themselves for punishment. There was a similar practice in ancient China. There was apparently no expectation of leniancy because of volunteering in this way, nor was leniancy given. The issue was considered to be that by this behavior the honor of the individual was redeemed. Consider the state of affairs here today (USA Wednesday, June 04, 2014 5:48 AM) where the guilty are always advised to plead "not guilty" and to fight to evade punishment to the end. After all, why should the common criminal behave differently than the king and the ministers of state? After all, why plead guilty to having broken unjust and irrational laws? Perhaps following the example of the Japanese politician and high-ranking business executive, in the past few years there has been a tendency for persons of note to publicly apologize for misbehavior after being caught. That's not quite the same thing, and the motive is always seen to be self-serving rather than honor-redeeming.<br />

					The Buddha lists four topics which are imponderable, whose scope is so vast as to cause madness in anyone who allowed them to obsess the mind. A good sutta to read alongside this one is <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.041.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.56.41</a> where pondering the world is defined and contrasted with pondering the four truths and where it becomes clear that when the Buddha does not respond to requests for opinions on these subjects it is not a case of keeping things a mystery, but a matter of retaining one's sanity or at least not giving others good reason to doubt of it. The important phrase to understand in this sutta is <i>'na cintetabbāni.'</i> Woodward's 'unthinkable', Bhk. Thanissaro: 'unconjecturables'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'inconceivable. Childers: 'regard'. <i>Cinteti</i> is the idea of thinking when the mind is conceived of as 'the heart'. "You see?" + <i>abbāni,</i> meaning ? to draw out. To draw out from the heart? That is actually what one does when one does this. You sit down with the intent to see the full scope of a topic and drag out first one train of thought then another.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.078.wood.pts.htm">Gifts,</a> Woodward translation.<br />
					The four states of purity of gifts. The idea here is that the returning good <i>kamma</i> from a gift depends not only on the character of the giver and the nature of the gift, but also on the character of the receiver. Think of the difference between the result of a wet rag thrown by a weak man against a hanging blanket versus a rubber ball thrown by a strong man against a smooth hard wall. 'Purity' is fundamentally a matter of detachment. 'Virtue' is the not-doing of unvirtuous deeds. Detachment allows the force of the deed to be fully discharged on the part of the giver and returned with amplified force to the giver by the receiver.<br />

					The explanation in terms of <i>Kamma</i> of why the enterprises of some individuals fail, while others turn out differently than expected, others turn out as expected and still others turn out beyond their expectations. In the <i>Pāḷi,</i> Sariputta asks <i>"Ko nu kho bhante hetu ko paccayo ~"</i> Woodward translates <i>"what is the reason what is the cause"</i> (usually <i>'hetu'</i> is translated 'cause'; when you read 'cause' in translations, look up the <i>Pāḷi,</i> if the <i>Pāḷi</i> is <i>'hetu'</i> think 'driving force' 'engine'; if it is <i>'nidana'</i> think 'bound up with' or 'bound down by'; if it is <i>'paccaya'</i> think [Edit, see <a href="#paccaya">paccaya</a> above] 'dependence', 'condition'.); Bhk. Bodhi just has "why", or "the reason why". A translation more helpful in understanding the meaning would be "What is the driving force, what results in these various experiences?" Of the many factors that go into success and failure in one's occupation, what is the one which is most determinant of the outcome? The Buddha uses a gift to a shaman or Brahmin as the example, but the same dynamics are at work with any person. Be careful of what you promise! Don't make promises you cannot keep. Make every effort to fulfill promises you have made and if you can see you will be unable to do so, get back to the person to whom the promise was made and make an explanation. Take a care for your future happiness! The feelings of the person expecting the fulfillment of a promise you have made are your feelings later. Woodward footnotes <i>Points of Controversy</i> where an objection is made to the whole proposition that there is such a tie between the giver and receiver based on the notion that since the individual is continuously changing, he cannot be said to be the same person from one minute to the next so that for him there is no return on a gift. A sort of madness that comes from getting high understanding only half the picture. In this case the person has understood the idea that there is no thing there that can be called the self and has come to the conclusion (formed the opinion, arrived at the point of view) that there is no self. It is vital to understand the Buddha's position with regard to subjective experience in order to understand why it is not correct to say that there is no self. There is the subjective experience of a continuing self. Until liberated from that by the understanding that it is not a true perception, that it is only identification with a point of view, that subjective self experiences suffering. If that were not the case, what would be the point of Buddhas or their <i>Dhamma?!</i> The Buddha's teaching is for the relief of that subjective suffering as well as for the complete liberation from it. Gotama's teaching is for the liberation from Pain. All Pain. Real or imagined.<br />

					Four reasons women do not occupy stations of importance, engage in commerse or trade. Both Woodward's and Bhk. Bodhi's translations have problems which will put women's backs up. I have done my translation hoping to show an alternative way the sutta can be read. The common problem is the categorical statement "Women are ... x,y,z bad trait. Which is why they do not do x,y,z, manly things." The <i>Pāḷi</i> must be 'heard' without the implication that these are absolute states. The construction is: "Wrath Ānanda womenfolk" etc. To translate: "Women are wrathful" must be heard as 'women being ~' or 'if a woman be', or 'are for the most part', 'are generally', 'some women are' etc. Bhk. Bodhi has attempted to mitigate the issue by inserting the words 'are prone,' but 'prone' is not in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and his translation still comes across as an irrational statement on the part of the Buddha. Separately, Woodward has changed the statement 'go to Kamboja' to 'reach the essence of the deed' reading <i>'kamm'ojaṃ'</i> for 'Kambojam'. The original PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> (since changed), the BJT and the CSCD, the commentary and whatever <i>Pāḷi</i> is being used by Bhk. Bodhi all have 'Kamboja.' Woodward has footnoted the commentary statement that this is to be understood as an idiom standing for 'foreign trade,' but he cannot see the sense of that. But there are too many examples in the suttas of women who have become Arahant to think that the meaning could be that women do not penetrate through to the essence of the deed. The bias of his translation has blinded Woodward to this contradiction in his understanding. As it stands to defend these translations would be to say that Gotama did not forsee the state of women in future time, or even outside the local area at that time and, additionally, or, to put it another way, this would be to say that this sutta was not 'timeless'. I believe my translation overcomes these drawbacks.<br />

					If the four suttas were intended to be taken together as a puzzle, there seem to be errors in Blue-Lotus 1 and White-Lotus 1. Both should have been that 'he weakened the <i>āsavas',</i> not destroyed them. I recollect that the releases are attainable by even the Streamwinner but still there is a distinction there that would make the relationship rational. Then all four groups would have the structure: Streamwinner, Once Returner, Non-returner, Arahant. Blue Lotus 3 could be experiencing temporary release. Otherwise perhaps Woodward's speculation that the first group only was original and the others made up (carelessly) to form the usual group of four pairs of men (those on the four paths). Or there is also the (doubtful) possibility that there was no intention of making the four sets parallel each other.<br />
					Then there is the problem with the translation of <i>'appattamānaso' (appatta-mānaso)</i> in the situation in Immovable Shaman 4. Woodward translates:  'has not made up his mind', Bhk. Bodhi: 'has not attained his mind's ideal'. Both of these appear to me at least as highly shakable. I sugest taking the word back a step: <i>appa pa atta māmaso</i> 'a little past mastering his mind'. Or 'mastering the mind' could be understood as a higher state than the certainty of attaining the goal of the Streamwinner. To be 'unshakable' he mist have got at least this far.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi argues from an assumption that Blue-Lotus 1 and White-Lotus 1 are correct that there appears to be a weakening of the standards for Arahantship involved. It could be that or it could be an error in the understanding of the situation on the part of the commentator or as I suggest, an error in the recollection of the sutta.</p>

Calm of heart is not exclusively the <i>jhānas.</i> Consummate <i>'samādhi'</i> is the <i>jhānas,</i> but along the way a serene calm should be the goal throughout the day in every activity. If one's practice is to create insight over here and practice creating serenity over there between the hours of x and y, or while a candle burns down one inch, or during the time a stick of incense burns down, or the effects of a joint wear off, by the sole technique of <i>jhāna,</i> it is likely that the whole practice will suffer.

Bodhi's translation which is clear. The very interesting thing in this sutta (once it is unabridged and straigtened up) is the visibility here of the way in which at least one style of dialog was conducted (there are many examples of this style in the suttas). Gotama lays out four cases and asks Potaliya to say which he thinks is best. Potaliya chooses one which is not the one which Gotama thinks is best. Gotama states that of the choices, a certain one is best. (No "you are wrong, I am right", but no waffling either. He makes the statement "This is the best, and for such and such a reason." In response Pataliya does not say "you are right, I am wrong," but indicates his acceptance of Gotama's case by stating it as Gotama has stated it explaining it as Gotama has explained it. This is the combat of two ideas without bringing in the personalities. Potalia might have disagreed up to three times and Gotama repeated the case up to a third time before Potaliya's head split into seven pieces.<br />

					Gotama likens four sorts of persons to four sorts of rain-clouds: one that thunders but doesn't rain, one that rains but doesn't thunder, one that neither rains nor thunders, one that both rains and thunders. He defines mastery of <i>Dhamma</i> as thundering, understanding the Four Truths as raining.<br />
					[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p103">AN 4.103</a>] <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.103.pali.bd.htm"><i>Kumbha Suttaṃ,</i></a> the <i>Pāḷi,</i><br />
					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.103.wood.pts.htm">The Pot,</a> Woodward translation.<br />
					In this sutta Gotama compares four sorts of persons to the conditions of four waterpots: one that is covered and empty, one that is uncovered and full; one that is both uncovered and empty; and one that is covered and full. He defines 'covered' as charming comportment, 'full' as knowledge of the Four Truths.<br />
					The <i>Pāḷi</i> has:<br />
					<i>Tuccho pihito,||<br />
					pūro vivaṭo,||<br />
					tuccho vivaṭo,||<br />
					pūro pihito.|| ||</i><br />
					empty and covered<br />
					full and uncovered<br />
					empty and uncovered<br />
					full and covered,<br />
					which is followed by Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi:<br />
					In the first case the person is charming but has no knowledge,<br />
					in the second case he is not charming but has knowledge,<br />
					in the third case he has neither charm nor knowledge<br />
					and in the fourth case he has both charm and knowledge.<br />
					The two good qualities are (according to the order of the details as we find them in the <i>Pāḷi</i>): 'full' of water which stands for charming comportment; and 'covered' which stands for comprehension of the Four Truths.<br />
					In the case of water-pots, 'empty' and 'uncovered' are not good things.<br />
					So following the details as they are presented, the order should have been:<br />
					<i>Pūro vivaṭo,||<br />
					tuccho pihito,||<br />
					tuccho vivaṭo,||<br />
					puro pihito,</i>||<br />
					full and uncovered,<br />
					empty and covered,<br />
					empty and uncovered,<br />
					and full and covered.<br />
					If we take it that the headings as they are found are correct and the details have been reversed, we would have comportment standing for 'covered' and knowledge standing for 'full'. This would more closely parallel the thinking in the previous two suttas where 'thunder' stands for speech in the one case and superficial book knowledge in the second, and rain (which, do I need to point out? is water) stands for understanding. This would also better satisfy the mind as indicating that 'full' points to the more significant aspect and 'covered' to the more superficial aspect.<br />
					But there is a further complication: The pattern in the previous suttas is that the first person's first quality is a positive one. The second person has the deeper quality but lacks the quality of lesser importance. And considering that, we cannot put understanding of the Four Truths in the place of the second place.<br />
					One way or the other the <i>Pāḷi</i> is incorrect and Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi follow and to make the sutta make sense either the headings need to change or the order of the details needs to change. What to do? I have chosen to change the order in the headings from first full, second covered, to first covered and second full (using Woodwards terms 'closed' and 'open', 'full' and 'empty'.)<br />
					<i>Pihito tuccho,||<br />
					vivaṭo pūro,||<br />
					vivaṭo tuccho,||<br />
					pihito pūro.|| ||</i><br />
					covered and empty<br />
					uncovered and full<br />
					uncovered and empty<br />
					covered and full,<br />
					This allows the details to remain in their current order and puts The Four Truths in the position given most respect.<br />
					Long explanation for a simple change, but in this case the <i>Pāḷi</i> and all the translations agree but all are in error and in such as case I need to present all the reasoning in back of a change. I have not changed the <i>Pāḷi.</i><br />

					These two should be one sutta as in the previous and the following; the first is incorporated in the second. Otherwise we have The Buddha teaching people about pools of water. The Buddha compares four sorts of persons to the conditions of four pools of water: one that is shallow but looks deep, one that is deep but looks shallow, one that is shallow and looks shallow, and one that is deep and looks deep. This sutta is a twist on the use of the two sets of terms. Here deepness is a matter of understanding the Four Truths or not, appearing deep or not is a matter of having charming comportment or not.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.106.wood.pts.htm">Mangoes,</a> Woodward translation.<br />
					The Buddha compares four sorts of persons to conditions of mangoes: one that is unripe and looks ripe, one that is ripe and looks unripe, one that is unripe and looks unripe, and one that is ripe and looks ripe. Bhk. Bodhi's version of the <i>Pāḷi</i> has two of these suttas on Mangoes one of which is in brief as per the "Pools of Water" suttas above where his text has only one of those. Both probems seem to arise from the summary index at the end of the chapter <i>(uddāna)</i> and are likely the result of an attempt to make the chapter have the usual ten suttas. But there is no sense to the brief versions of either of these suttas. When the Buddha teaches in brief, the brief teaching still makes good <i>Dhamma.</i><br />

					I tend to think this is another sutta where the headings should be reversed and inverted as per 103 above, but a case can be made either way, so I have left it as it is.<br />

					The Buddha likkens persons to snakes in the matter of their possession of venom and the potency of that venom. This one appears to rely on word-play similar to our double meaning for venom: poison and poisonous temperment. But the word for poisonous temperment means 'terribly-poisonous', which leaves us with the best case being 'not terribly poisonous' which is still poisonous. Bhk. Bodhi probably has the best solution to this one: 'one who'se venom is quick to come up but not virulent', etc. where the best case becomes 'neither quick to come up nor virulent.' But we still end up with a sutta that deals with sorts of people with anger.<br />

					<p>*One complete evolution and devolution of the World-system.</p>

					<p>†There is no specification as to the nature of the 'hearer' (<i>Bhagavato sāvaka</i>), but presumably this would at least require the individual to have unshakable faith or to have conceived the yearning to bring rebirth to an end or the idea of Arahantship would not occur to him ... and it would not happen unawares.</p>

					</div>

					<p class="f4">Except for the cases of the non-believer, all of these are Non-Returner paths. Note that except where the practice of <i>jhāna</i> leads directly to the Pure Abodes, the implication is that the full lifespan of the destination is to be lived. There is a definate progression with regard to rebirth of each succeeding devine abiding, with that of <i>upekha,</i> rebirth in the <i>Vehapphala</i>-world being the most pleasant and long lasting, but that if the time it takes to achieve Arahantship is considered, the hierarchy is reversed. This accords with a theme that runs throughout the suttas that it is better to 'take one's medicine' here — that though the life in lower worlds may be more unpleasant, it is also more conducive to achieving the goal. A note of non-carelessness not to take this to extremes! The situation again reverses at the point below human birth where each succeeding lower rebirth is more difficult to escape.

					A Wonderous light appears when a Buddha descends into his mother's womb, at his birth, at his awakening and upon his first setting to roll the wheel of <i>Dhamma.</i> I wonder if this is not a distortion of what Gotama actually said, maybe a subtle wording misunderstood. At other points he is said to have spoken metaphorically of his appearance as being a light brought into the world, which it certainly was, and that was certainly marvel enough. Also, this light that he brought is said to make it possible for beings living in darkness to see that there are other beings there. This is a remark very frequently made by those who have become converts. I suggest this is a reference to the breaking of <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's problem</a> which unbroken makes it impossible to prove to one's self that there are other beings there. The breaking of this problem does release a sort of vision which could be understood as light making visible other being here.<br />

					The Buddha points out the marvelous way nobles, brahmins, householders and ascetics take delight when a Wheel-turning King approaches and speaks and then he compares this phenomena with the similar thing that happens when Ānanda approaches and teaches <i>bhikkhus, bhikkhunis,</i> laymen and lay-women.<br />
					With this sutta one can see the nature of seeing into the future. At another point Gotama says of Ānanda that if he did not attain to Arahantship, he would become a Wheel-turning King. Although for most of us the memory of the last wheel-turning King will be somewhat faint, the mechanism is the same for seeing into the future by way of comparison with past events that are more easily called to mind. This is not the same thing as predicting the future from past events as it is practiced by the weatherman or the general or the political scientist. That is an intellectual exercise which is frequently incorrect. This is 'seeing' in a moment of intuition, the correspondence of two events and 'knowing' the significance. So after three suttas giving us marvels, we have a fourth telling us how to see such things for ourselves. That is, if you have an open mind and a ready ear. Otherwise you are, of course, free to think 'he is just talking through his hat.'</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.131.wood.pts.htm">Fetters,</a> Woodward translation.<br />
					The Buddha describes four sorts of persons in relationship to the sorts of yokes to rebirth <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>[saṇyogana]</i></a> they have or have not yet got rid of.<br />
					This sutta raises important issues. First is an unusual breakdown of the <i>saṇyoganas:</i><br />
					<b>1.</b> those yoking one to rebirth in the lower worlds Woodward translates 'this World' and then, for the Once Returner translates in a way that can be misunderstood as indicating that he has not broken any of the first five fetters (this, apparently, an opinion derived from commentary). But these are yokes to any <i>'kama-loka'</i> which includes the <i>deva-</i>worlds up to the <i>Tusita</i> Realm — see the Buddhist cosmology <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#realms">here</a> — These first five yokes are: 1. The One-truth (own-body) view, 2. Doubt about <i>kamma,</i>  the Awakening of the Buddha, etc., 3. Belief that good deeds, ethical conduct or rituals can bring an end to Pain, 4. Wishing for pleasure, 5. Deviant thinking. When the first three of these are broken by the Streamwinner, he is no longer subject to rebirth lower than the world of humans. He is able to see when he is hanging on to a way of viewing his individuality that will lead him to hell or some other low state and is able to let that go without having the strength to let go of every sort of being. The Once-returner is also a Streamwinner, so he will have at least broken the first three yokes. The Buddha is in this case speaking of the category as a whole, not its individual components. He does not say 'has not broken any fetters' he says 'has not broken the <i>'orambhāgiyāni saṇyojanāni.'</i> All five.<br />
					<b>2.</b> those yoking one to rebirth<br />
					<b>3.</b> those yoking one to existence.<br />
					Bhkkhu Bodhi cites the commentary for definition of the last two and the result is a restatement of the terms with nothing informative added.<br />
					You are welcome to disagree, but I suggest we do not need to go off into bizarre speculations relying on the commentary to understand these last two categories. It is sufficient to carefully examine the nature of the 10 <i>saṇyojanāni</i> that we are given.<br />
					First, to understand the latter two categories, one must understand fetter #1: <i>sa-k-kāya-ditthi.</i> The usual understanding is that this means 'view of self' understanding that to mean the idea one has that one has an eternal self, etc. Actually the usual understanding is to flip to the view that there is no self which is why this yoke must be understood in broader terms than 'own-self'. The emphasis should be on the 'view' part of the compound. The holding onto points of view concerning individuality with the idea: 'This alone is the truth, all other views are stupidity.' The Streamwinner who has freed himself from this yoke will have understood that the problem of pain arises as a result of the holding on to a view concerning his having an eternal self, but he will not necessarily have actually abandoned the identification, thoughts, and so forth that arise from having had that point of view in the past. It's like the phantom limb phenomena. He is likened to the person who has come across a well without a bucket to retrieve the water. [see <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p68">SN 2.12.68</a>] He can see the solution (as it were) but has not got the means to drink.<br />
					In a similar way all the first five fetters have to do with orienting the intellect to the goal and focusing the individual's behavior on elimination of various gross obstructions to perception of his inner workings. These first five do not constitute having uprooted the underlying drive to be. The next two fetters are lust for form and lust for immaterial existence: the underlying drives to be, aka: yokes to actual rebirth.<br />
					The final three yokes are pride, a fear-ridden-anxiety, and being subject to misunderstanding (aka blindness). Here we have the case of the person who has sufficient experience to prevent him from behavior that would result in rebirth in any realm of being, but for whatever reason (long habit, experience, difficult circumstances) there remain these subtle states of mind. This is the case of the Non-Returner who no longer own-makes <i>(saṅkhārams)</i> and who obtains final release at some point after the death of the body but before assuming any rebirth.<br />
					There is much discussion back and forth concerning the precise state this individual is in caused by trying to imagine a state of existence which does not require rebirth. A between-births. But this is not necessary if one examines <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_11_ekadasakanipata.htm#p7">AN 11.7</a> and similar suttas where it is stated that there is the possibility of perception without perception of 'being' in any realm of 'being'. 'Existence' is a matter of perception, rebirth is a matter of having acted upon perception to the effect of having set rolling identification with form or the formless. The <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> differentiates between <i>bhava</i> and <i>jāti:</i> existence and rebirth. This person is percipient of these subtle mental states. That is what remains for him of existence. That is what he gets rid of, without assuming rebirth, to become Arahant.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/04_fours/an04.132.olds.bd.htm">Orators,</a> Olds, translation.<br />
					A little four-liner about the facility and precision with which persons utter speech or engage in banter or repartee.<br />
					The three terms to understand are: <i>paṭibhāna, yutta-paṭibhāno</i> and <i>mutta-paṭibhāno.</i> <i>Yutta</i> = yoked; <i>mutta</i> = free; <i>paṭibhāna = paṭi + bhāna</i> = re(flect back on) + <i>bhāna.</i><br />
					The trouble starts with the meaning of <i>'bhāna'.</i> PED does not list this term. Points of Controversy has it coming from <i>'bhā'</i> 'to become apparent'; possibly it comes from <i>'bhāṇaka'</i> reciting, or <i>'bhaṇati,</i> to speak, say, tell, recite, preach.<br />
					Woodward translates <i>paṭibhāna</i> 'reply'. Bhk. Bodhi translates 'discernment'. In their discussion of terms in <i>Points of Controversy</i> pg. 377, Shwe Zan Ang and Mrs. Rhys Davids describe the meaning as being 'that by which things knowable become represented, are present'. (Which requires some <i>paṭibhāna</i> to understand.) Or 'analytic insight'. A footnote there translates the term 'rhetorical gift'. My reading says this term refers to the product of discernment in speach, not the thinking processes that precede speech. Also it looks to go beyond mere reply and include spontaneous recitation. So I would settle on re-citation. That would result in the 'literal' translation:<br />
					One has yoked-recitation not free-recitation;<br />
					one has free-recitation not yoked-recitation;<br />
					one has yoked-recitation <i>and</i> free-recitation;<br />
					and one has neither yoked-recitation nor free-recitation.<br />
					Now is that 'yoked to the topic,' 'speaking precisely,' or yoked in the sense of restrained, constrained; or is that 'speaking concisely'? Is 'free recitation' unrestrained recitation or easily flowing recitation and in either case is the negative 'constrained recitation' and does that mean 'constrained to the topic' or 'speaking concisely'? <img src="../../resources/images/obo_vry_sm.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="Obo say!" title="hoya hoya hoya" /><br />
					Both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi appear to be following their understanding of the commentary. Woodward has 'to the point' and 'diffuse'. He has abridged person #3 to: 'he who does both'. Unabridged this becomes 'to the point and diffuse'. At best, this needs to be heard as 'on point and in detail.' Person 4, who is neither, would be one who was 'neither to the point nor difuse' for which we might be thankful at least for the brevity.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi has translated 'incisive and 'free-flowing'. Incisive, in meaning number 2, (not as in #1, cuttingly): precisely and with exactitude. Yoked to the topic, free in terms of readiness of wit. Bhk. Bodhi's translation of <i>'paṭibhāno'</i> as 'discernment' makes these aspects of 'discernment'. But reciting or discerning, it is at least possible to be both precise and have free-flowing thoughts or speech or to be neither precise nor have free-flowing thoughts or speech.<br />
					Woodward complicates the issue noting the commentary on the <i>Puggalapaññatti</i> as suggesting the meaning for 'yutta' as 'succinct'; 'mutta' as 'rambling'. This would alter the meaning to:<br />
					One has succinct speech/discernment not rambling speech/discernment;<br />
					one has rambling speech/discernment not succinct speech/discernment;<br />
					one has succinct speech/discernment and rambling speech/discernment;<br />
					one has neither succinct speech/discernment nor rambling speech/discernment.<br />
					Between Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi, Bhk. Bodhi's solution works the best if read without discernment. (Sorry, couldn't help myself. To be precise, I was feeling unconstrained.)<br />
					I dipped my oar in with my own solution which takes a little from here and a little from there.<br />

					Four sorts of persons sorted out according to their having mastered their body or their mind or neither or both.<br />
					It is interesting to note that mastering the body is put only in terms of living alone in the forest. This makes it probable that this was an early sutta. Later control of the body would have been phrased in broader terms of living in solitude. Bhk. Bodhi translates the term <i>'nikaṭṭha,'</i> rendered by Woodward as 'subdued,' as 'retreat'. "gone on retreat by" PED: brought down, debased, low. <i>ni</i> = down; <i>kaṭṭha</i> = plowed. Plowed under.<br />

					one that says much and that is off point with a following that is incompetent to judge and so considers him a <i>Dhamma-</i>talker;<br />

					Four persons: one able to convey the intent but not the letter; one able to convey the letter but not the intent; one able to do neither and one able to do both.<br />
					The Buddha concludes this sutta with the statement that one who has the four <i>paṭisambhidā</i> could not falter in both the conveyance of the intent <i>and</i> the conveyance of the letter. <i>Paṭisambhidā</i> <i>paṭi:</i> (reflect back on) + <i>sam</i> = co, con, with; + <i>bhida</i> break apart, analyze. That which is reflected back upon analysis ... in this case of the intent, the form, the roots, and the manner of rethorical exposistion of a teaching.  (Woodward: the Four Analytical Powers; Bhk. Bodhi: The Four Analytical Knowledges) These are: <i>attha,</i> the spirit or intent or aim or goal of word, phrase or complete exposition; <i>dhamma,</i> one authority (U. Pandi, pg. 377 <i>Points of Controversy</i>) says this is understanding the word, another (the <i>Abhidhamma</i>) understanding the logic behind an expression — it is possible to merge these two sets of ideas ('this is said this way (the word) because people hear this expression thus (the reason)', 'this is said in this order (the word) because in this way it has such and such an effect on the mind (the reason)' 'this is said this way (the word) because this is the order in which the idea expresses its evolution and logical basis (the reason); etc.), but this may be a confusion of this term with the next, and the meaning of <i>'dhamma'</i> is 'thing', 'form' or 'the Word' and the <i>Abhidhamma</i> always tries to make things appear more obscure than they are and in this case they are trying to make this into knowledge <i>of</i> <i>Dhamma.</i> But that would make this not a universal set of tools of analysis, but one directed at this <i>Dhamma</i> only and usually when Gotama is speaking about his <i>Dhamma</i> he makes it clear that that is what he is doing; <i>nirutti,</i> the knowledge and intuitive knowledge of the roots of both word and phrase and the proper grammatical construction thereof (for example, etymology, or understanding the origin and meaning of an idiomatic expression); <i>(to digress: in what I have called 'Old <i>Pāḷi</i>' where the letter is a syllable, a syllable is a word, and a word is a sentence, the explanation of the word in the science of <i>Nirutti</i> is more along the lines of the explanation of the origins and meaning of the idiomatic expression than the construction of a 'word' from the meaning of its 'syllables'.</i> A <i>Pāḷi</i> 'word' is something like a Chinese pictogram. And like such, a <i>Pāḷi</i> word can be read forwards and backwards and assumes different meanings with different inflections (rather than being a separate word with 'different' spelling, long <i>ā,</i> etc.) and is to be understood in multiple ways — that is, not in many separate ways but in many ways simultaneously. (The same thing happens in English even today, but the phenomena goes mostly unnoticed ... except in certain cases of madness.<img src="../../resources/images/obo_vry_sm.jpg" width="32" height="40" alt="Obo say!" title="hoya hoya hoya" /> What we have in the dictionaries is a selection from the possibilities, not the entire scope. Not understanding this is the source of many misunderstandings made by modern linguistic analysis. It is a form of linguistic imprisonment constraining us to one reality. ... and it is always breaking down.) and <i>paṭibhāna</i> (see <a href="#an132">discussion at 132</a> above), the knowledge of (and inspired access to) retorical expression, enrapturing turn of phrase, tactics in the conveyance of an idea.

					Four paths to the eradication of the corrupting influences: the unpleasant slow path to higer knowledge; the unpleasant fast path to higher knowledge, the pleasant slow path to higher knowledge, and the pleasant swift path to higher knowledge.<br />
					A variation on the previous, with this sutta providing the methods of practice used by those following each path. Of note here is something that could be used to support the idea of arahantship without the <i>jhānas.</i> The first two modes of pratice do not use the <i>jhānas</i> as their <i>samādhi</i> practice; they use meditation on the foul. (If we stretch our minds all the way over to <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.009.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.54.9</a> we can see that it appears that meditation on the foul was at an early point the <i>main</i> practice employed by the <i>bhikkhus</i> to establish serenity <i>(samādhi)</i>.) The distinction is clear. The difference is that by using the <i>jhānas</i> the practice is pleasant. All four paths depend on the practitioners powers <i>(balāni)</i> of faith, modesty, self-restraint, energy, and wisdom. Speed of insight depends on the degree to which the forces <i>(indriya)</i> of faith, energy, mind, serenity and wisdom are found in him. These latter are characterized (in the previous sutta) as 'givens' depending on the individual's basic nature in terms of the degree to which he is passionate, malicious, infatuated. ('Given' does not mean unalterable. Its just what you start with.)<br />
					So the method described here is that one who works at reducing his passionate, malicious, infatuated nature, controlling himself by way of faith, modesty, self-restraint, energy, and wisdom, would experience a proportionate rise in the forces of faith, energy, mind, serenity and wisdom and by that an increase in the speed of his attainment of higher knowledge, if he is indifferent as to whether or not his path is pleasant, he uses the meditation on the foul, if he wishes his path to be pleasant he uses the <i>jhānas.</i> Who would choose the unpleasant path? Maybe it is that <i>jhāna</i> practice requires great long stretches of solitude, calm, peace, quiet to develop. Such things are not always easy to come by. Meditation on the foul is a practice which can be worked into a more turbulant life situation.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/04_fours/an04.169.olds.bd.htm">Afflicted Extinguishment,</a> Olds translation.<br />
					The Buddha distinguishes between two sorts of persons in accordance with their path: one pair meditates on the foul and one pair uses the <i>jhānas.</i> Of each pair one attains extinguishment here and one hereafter. In the case of the first pair, meditating on the foul, extinguishment either here or hereafter comes after own-making <i>(saṅkhāra).</i> In the case of the second pair, using the <i>jhānas,</i> extinguishment either here or hereafter comes without own-making.<br />
					In the description of the type of person Woodward translates <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> as 'with- and without effort'; but in the list of contemplations, he translates it 'activities'. Bhk. Bodhi does a similar thing using 'exertion' and 'conditioned phenomena'. <i>'Saṅkhāra'</i> does have the dual meaning of the activity used to create personal existence and the identified-with existing thing, but the translation should make it more obvious that it is the two sides of this one idea that are being spoken of. 'Confounding' and 'the confounded' or 'fabricating' and 'the fabricated'. And it is not 'conditioned'! (see the discussion: <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is <i>Nibbāna</i> Conditioned</a>) And the idea is not just 'activity' but 'identification with the intent to create the experience of pleasure through action of thought, speech, and body; and the identified with result. It is essential to grasp this idea in order to understand how the Buddha is distinguishing the two sets of individuals. The contemplation of the unpleasant involves <i>saṅkhāra</i> (it involves personal, identified-with perceptions and thoughts and intentions and behavior), where the <i>jhānas</i> do not (or, at least they evolve towards and culminate in detachment precluding own-making). In other words both paths get one there, but the one using contemplation of the foul involves a battle with issues of the self which must be resolved first. This is a very important sutta to read when trying to understand the meaning of <i>saṅkhāra.</i> If you do not have the concept correctly, the sutta makes no sense.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/04_fours/an04.171.olds.bd.htm">Intentions (a),</a> Olds translation<br />
					The Buddha describes how it is intent that is the mechanism of action of <i>kamma</i> of body, speech and mind that results in the personal experience of pleasure or pain in body, speech, or mind. Intent, in turn, is shown to be impersonal. The intent driving a deed can arise in the self or in another. Further, the groundwork for action can be known or unknown. In whatever combination of factors it is blindness that is at the bottom of it and the elimination of blindness that ends <i>kamma</i> for the individual.<br />
					An example of other-instigated (or motivated) intent and preparation for action would be the case of the soldier being commanded to act by the general, the employee by the boss, etc. In the case of an other-instigated intent, both the instigator and the one who is instigated experience the consequences in accordance with the intent. There is no escape by saying 'I was just following orders.' Better to refuse to act when the action (<i>e.g.,</i> killing, lying, theft, etc., for whatever reason) deviates from one's own perspective on the <i>kammic</i> outcome and take the consequences than to follow orders and take consequences resulting from another's intent (<i>e.g.,</i> to inflict pain from motives based in lust, hate, delusion)! At least you won't end up in hell from refusing to do some foul deed.<br />
					This sutta is, in some versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> and in Bhk. Bodhi's translation, combined with the next sutta. Whether or not it was at one time a single sutta, it should be read in conjunction with that sutta.<br />

					The Buddha describes two pairs of individuals. One pair is striving to get rid of 'own-body', the other is striving to break up 'blindness'. In each of the pairs the persons have attained peaceful states of mind and liberation of heart and work at their objective but in one case there is no excitement at the task while in the other there is. The Buddha states that where this excitement is missing, the task is unlikely to be accomplished.<br />
					The task of the first individual is said to be to eliminate 'own-body' <i>(sakkāya-nirodha).</i> Not 'own-body-view' <i>(sakkāya-diṭṭhi).</i> But there is no 'own-body' there to get rid of. How are we to understand this? Bhk. Thanissaro translates it: 'cessation of self-identification', Bhk. Bodhi: 'cessation of personal existence', but Woodward translates it more closely to what is found in the <i>Pāḷi:</i> 'ending of the person-pack'. The task has two parts: breaking the hold of the view that the way one sees the self is 'the one true view' concerning the self (<i>e.g.,</i> that body is the self, or belongs to the self or is a product of the self or has the self within it); and actually attaining liberation from that body. It looks as though what is being spoken of is the latter task, but the wording is not so clear as to allow certainty. If the meaning is breaking the view, what we have here is advanced meditators who have gained liberation of heart working on the attainment of Streamwinning. (Not an impossibility, but it adds a dimension of complexity to the situation which is confusing.) Similarly confusing is the second set of persons, those working on 'breaking up blindness' <i>(avijjā-p-pabheda).</i> (PED: breaking or splitting up, opening. Giving the example of analyzing a word by way of breaking it into syllables). (Bhk. Thanissaro: 'the breaching of ignorance'; Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi: 'the breaking up of ignorance') This also can be divided into two tasks: the first is intelectual comprehension of the truth of the four truths or the seeing that 'all that which has come to be comes to an end' (which would be 'breaching of ignorance'), the second is the actual seeing of the truths at work (or the no longer seeing of things as working in accordance with the previously held view one believed was the 'one true view' because one is now able to know and see 'the dependence of this on that') as in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> (which would be the breaking up of ignorance). And again here if the first task is being referred to we would have the case of an advanced meditator working on Streamwinning. If it is the second case, the task has gone beyond seeing the truth of the four truths (which is necessary to break through the <i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</i>) and is now focused on all the peripheral or collateral misbegotten beliefs that accompany holding on to a view of self and things. Since the term in the second group is 'breaking up' as in analyzing (where Bhk. Thanissaro has used a misleading term here that points to the attaining of Streamwinning) we have grounds for understanding the intent of the sutta to be the second stage in both sets of persons, that is that they are Streamwinners working on the higher accomplishments (Arahantship): ending self-view, all-round or complete detachment from body, or any sort of self-identification (we could say: 'the ending of 'own-body' in quotes, meaning not just the ending of the view, but the ending of the experience itself), and breking up blindness.<br />

					A well-known (and too little used) sutta. The Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> to determine whether or not a saying is to be considered as his word by comparing the phrases and their construction  (<i>padavyañjana:</i> <i>pada:</i> phrase; <i>vyañjana,</i> lubrication, component parts; Woodward: 'words and syllables'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'words and phrases'. The precise meanins of this phrase is worth a deeper look. <i>'Pada'</i> is literally 'foot', <i>Pāda</i> 'footstep' or 'path'. In the spoken language the 'letter' was a syllable, and the <i>bhikkhus</i> were on occasion remarked to take pride in repeating Gotama's word 'down to the syllable', but <i>vyañjana</i> means 'letter' only in the sense of 'as opposed to the spirit'. It does mean component part and derives from the idea of lubricant (enabling the letters to work together and make sense) and stretching out, drawing out or erecting, i.e. the construction of the phrase) with the phrases and their construction as found in the <i>Suttas</i> and in the <i>Vinaya.</i> This is to be done even in the case of four great authorities: Someone who has reportedly heard a saying face-to-face with the Buddha; some <i>Saṅgha</i> with a reportedly learned elder; some reportedly learned <i>Saṅgha;</i> a single reportedly learned monk.<br />
					Today this is taught with the idea that we are to accept it as the word of the Buddha if it comes from any of these four 'authorities'. This is exactly the opposite of the meaning found in the sutta. We should also add that this work of comparison should be done with any reportedly true saying heard from any 'authority' or read about (including any translation from the <i>Pāḷi</i>) in any book or anywhere on the internet. 'Any' includes 'is'sef 'ere. <img src="../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /><br />

					Another <i>suttanta</i> delivered by Gotama towards the end of his life. We have a cross link in this sutta to the events described in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.012.horn.pts.htm">MN 12.</a> (see also <a href="#mn12">below</a>). This sutta describes events leading up to the resignation of Sunakkhatta from the order. Sunakkhatta has complained that Gotama works no feats of magic for him nor does he tell him about the origins of the world. But Gotama tells of several events where he worked feats of magic right in front of Sunakkhatta which were acknowledged by him as feats of magic. Then he describes several ways theories of the origin of the world are arrived at. I find this one of the most humorous suttas in the entire collection. This puts me in the class of a schoolboy on holiday in the opinion of Rhys Davids. All things considered that is probably not an insult to me. There are, however, things in this sutta which are extraordinary and worthy of deep thought. The major problem in formatting the sutta was getting the quotation marks correctly. What is at work is a hypnotic technique which does one of two things: throws the listener right off track or raises such a state of concentration as allows virtual transportation to the events being described. That was the point: that is, to create belief in the listener by bringing him to the position of eye-witness. It does this on multiple levels within the range of the contemporary scene and then it juxtaposes all those with visions of the ancient past right back to the origins of the world cycle. It has quotations within stories within quotations within stories within stories with quotations. I have tried to make the sequences more apparent by the use of indentations as well as the progression of quotation marks. There is one passage which is left abridged as it is not clear how Rhys Davids would have translated it. He summarizes which is not helpful. The possibility exists that I have not got the quotation marks perfectly correctly.<br />

I have no great confidence I have got it completely correctly.)<br />
					<a id="dn29" href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.29.rhyt.pts.htm">The Delectable Discourse,</a> Rhys Davids translation.<br />
					Gotama responds to the news that the death of Nāthaputta the Nigantha has resulted in the break-up and general disorder of his followers by outlining in great detail the solid foundation on which the <i>Saṅgha</i> has been constructed. This is another sutta given towards the very end of Gotama's life. (<a href="#mn12">see below</a> for another). This is a <i>'suttanta'</i> or a compilation. In this case there seems no reason to think that it was not 'compiled' by Gotama himself. At one point, one of the themes being discussed is in the form of what is known in old-time religion as a 'devil-downer': a series which gets progressively more complex as it is developed. (The devil, not being so bright, cannot follow ... if you ever are being tracked closely and need to escape.) It takes the form of: If not A, then not 1; if A then 1; but if A and not B, then not 1, but if A and B, then 1; but if not A and B and C, then not 1... X19. Totally lost, as was so much else in this sutta, by abridgment. There is much in this sutta when unabridged as it is here which will tempt one to skip, and this is one of them, but I highly recommend you give it a chance. If you give it alert attention all the way through, or better yet, try to repeat it from memory, you will come close to the concentration it needs to have had to be delivered in the first place. If you do this and note the point where you no longer have an underlying tendency to get on with it or go to sleep, you will have firmly entered into the first <i>jhāna.</i> There is also the possibility in making this effort that you will have insight into and respect for the power of the mind that is giving us this doctrine. You can safely think that whoever this person was, he was something extraordinary.<br />
					The translation of this <i>suttanta</i> by Rhys Davids has likely gone a long way towards incresing the confusion over the issue of things the Buddha "did not reveal". [see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.29.rhyt.pts.htm#pg128">pg 128</a> text <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg128">pg 136</a>] Where Rhys Davids has "Brother, this hath not been revealed by the Exalted One." (Why Rhys Davids makes this error is a mystery, as he seems to have understood the issue clearly elsewhere. It seems the differentiation between a doctrine based on a point of view and one based only on what can be seen directly is not yet clear in his mind.) The <i>Pāḷi</i> is <i>"Etam pi kho āvuso Bhagavatā avyākataṃ:"</i> <i>"Avyākata"</i> would be better translated 'not-explained' or 'not responded to'. The <i>Pāḷi</i> repeats the question: 'This has not been responded to; that is: The Question" The word 'revealed' implies that there is something to reveal that has not been revealed. The <i>meaning</i> is that Gotama has not made any <i>response</i> to this question. It is not that he has not dealt with the issue. He has. It is thoroughly dealt with by the explanation that the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panc_upadana_kkhandha.htm">khandhas</a> are not the self. The questioner is really asking if the <i>khandhas</i> of one who has attained the goal are reborn and in what condition. Since the one who has attained the goal is no longer defined by the <i>khandhas,</i> the question does not apply. Further, it is not a mystery as to why he does not respond to the question. He explains his reason clearly: it is because for those who do not see the situation as it really is, it is possible to form directly opposing opinions on such an issue. Not knowing, the issue is a matter of speculation, a matter of viewpoint. Debating or offering opinions on matters of viewpoint does not conduce to dispassion or to the attaining of the goal. The Buddha sticks to the goal. Elsewhere in the suttas the same situation is put in the form of the questioner asking: "Do you <i>say</i> ~" or <i>"hold"</i> and the Buddha answering "Not that." He does not <i>say</i> such a thing or <i>hold</i> such a point of view. When asked what he does say, he responds. The idea that there is some mystery there that is to remain unrevealed serves those who would use such a mystery to cloak their own lack of understanding and promote their own agendas — They know the secret, if you want to know it, then it will cost you in one way or another.</p>

					<p class="f4">The more we see of this whole business of writing down the suttas and translating what has been written down the clearer it becomes as to why Gotama did not want it to be written down or translated: it becomes a matter of endlessly putting out fires that arise as a consequence of misinterpretation. And fires that are written down have a greatly extended persistence. Similarly translations are highly subject to error and quickly get out of control. And "fires" are ideas that have already lead countless beings astray in a matter of importance beyond calculation in terms of misery. Left in the hands of those who had them in memory, the difficult doctrines would be preserved by those with strong, well disciplined minds where the highly motivated could seek them out and be sure of getting the doctrine in a form closely adhering to the original and the populous would be better off with the basic training in giving and the development of higher standards of behavior. Even if the major doctrines quickly vanished and all that remained was the basic training that would have been better for the majority than the propagation of the false doctrines that have arisen through misunderstandings created by the limitations of expression in the written word and through the misundestandings 'caused' by translation. There would have been frauds and the deluded, but they would not have had the ability to point to 'an authoritative body of original documentation' to support misconceptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">As it is, there is no escaping doubt as to the correctness of <i>any</i> translation. And consequently, with every new translation the true <i>Dhamma</i> becomes more and more difficult to find. Can we justify further translations or the further dissemination of the translations we have? I ask myself this with every new upload.</p>

					<p class="f4">The remedy for doubt of the correctness of a translation is to turn to the <i>Pāḷi,</i> and because even there are found reasons for doubt, the only reasonable resort is putting the system as it is found and understood (whether in translations or the <i>Pāḷi</i> or from a teacher who has learned it from the translations or the <i>Pāḷi</i>) into practice. There is no knowing for sure until you do it. For those whose interest is in freedom, and who understand that freedom means the freedom from any sort of pain and that that includes birth in any form of existence, the thing that needs to be listened to is the liberating aspect of any statement. That <i>seeing,</i> that there is no bondage whatsoever in a result, is the true guide.</p>

					<p class="f4">As for writing and translation, that rabbit is out of the hat, the milk has been spilt, the water has passed under the bridge and over the dam, the fly is in the ointment and the hair is in the soup, there is no sense in beating a dead horse, but have too many cooks spoiled the broth? The only thing for us here at this time [Saturday, April 19, 2014 7:10 AM] is to make the best of a poor situation. It was easy, before printing and before the digital age for individuals to claim an understanding of what the Buddha taught that was no more than their pre-conceived notions. Now the essence, the real truth, of what Gotama taught can be found in most of the translations we have if they are read very carefully and cross checked with each other and the <i>Pāḷi</i> and against the wisdom of long personal experience tempered with good sense and the criteria raised by the goal of freedom and altered accordingly. So it seems like the best course is to get at least one or two translations of every sutta out there, free, and in digital form so that the influence of any one translation or unpublished sutta or point of view on what is being said is diminished and the small errors and weighty false doctrines can be countered by placement along side available evidence.</p>

					<p class="f4">It appears that it is human nature that newcomers will form hasty opinions as to the goal and as to their attainments. These, because of the temptations of fame or profit will be easily persuaded to propagate their notions. There will be those who follow. There will be for some of these the desire to find out more. Where the full scope of the suttas is not easily available there is little hope that these lost sheep will find the path, where, as now, the suttas are completely available, in multiple versions along with the <i>Pāḷi,</i> there is for the mislead at least some hope. To make access to the full spectrum of teachings even more easily accessible is the best justification for dealing with the present situation by the effort to get all available existing suttas on line and available without cost.</p>

					<p class="f4">In putting the translation of this sutta together I came upon the problem of rendering the term <i>'vedana'</i> (for which issue see the <a href="#vedana">discussion below</a>). I decided the best option in this case would be to render the term 'sense-experience' as when this term is used in the <i>khandhas</i> it implies the experience of the senses of the individual. Then, seeing there also the terms for perception, and consciousness it occurred to me that the same issue applies to these terms as well, that is that they are used for both the Arahant and the Individual but are to be understood differently for each, and that the solution applied to <i>'vedana'</i> would also be helpful if applied to <i>'sañña'</i> and <i>'viññāṇa':</i> that is, to distinguish the term 'consciousness' where it is being used of the consciousness of the ordinary person we should translate it 'sense-consciousness', and similarly for 'perception', 'sense-perception'. Where the terms apply to the Arahant (see discussion of <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm#vinnana"><i>viññāṇa anidassana</i></a> and <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_11_ekadasakanipata.htm#p8">AN 11.8</a> and others there like it) we can just leave them un-augmented. Previously I have tried to point out this distinction with regard to 'consciousness' by translating 'individualized consciousness' which is what it is. It is difficult to understand why there were in these cases no new terms invented to distinguish the ordinary person and the Arahant, but it may have been that in the creation of a new set of terms there would have been seen to be the implication that where they were the states of the Arahant they were 'states of existence' which would be exactly wrong. Or may be it just did not seem important as the ordinary person would not be concerned and the student of this <i>Dhamma</i> would be taught. Or maybe it was thought wise to leave it as a challenge to figure out as bearing down would be needed to comprehend the issue anyway. The best I can do to offer a distinction for the reader is something like: The Arahant has the consciousness of the not-consciousness of sense-consciousness. His consciousness depends on freedom from sense-consciousness as its basis and by that cannot be said to 'be in existence'. It has not crossed over into personal identification with <i>rūpa,</i> 'matter.' One can experience the idea of 'extra-sensory' sight simply by recollecting an image from a dream or noting the fact of 'seeing' objects in daydreams or <i>jhāna.</i> This is 'seeing' an object other than by way of the eye.</p>

Rhys Davids, translation,<br />
					Linked to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.14.012.pali.bd.htm"><i>Pāḷi.</i></a> The Buddha describes how sensual desire, deviance, and cruelty and their opposites arise from perception of information about things of a like nature. Mrs. Rhys Davids uses 'cause' for her translation of <i>'nidana',</i> tied-to, bound up with or down to. This idea pervades most people's thinking about Buddhism but it needs to be re-examined.</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">"The era of big data challenges the way we live and interact with the world. Most strikingly, society will need to shed some of its obsession for causality in exchange for simple correlations: not knowing <i>why</i> but only <i>what."</i><br />
							<br />
							"The ideal of identifying causal mechanisms is a self-congratulattory illusion..."</p>

							<p class="f2 in2">— quotes coinsidentally found in Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier, <b>Big Data</b> Once again modern science catches up to Buddhsim. But I would say "Most strikingly, society will have to stop calling correlations causes."</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil does not cause evil. It is through perception of evil - the cognizance of information conveying the idea of evil - that the idea of evil arises in the mind but the evil information did not 'cause' that idea, it came up in association with, bound up in that information. A thing that causes another thing always causes that other thing. That being the case there could be no escape from what that thing caused. But there is escape. Through the analysis of a thing into its component parts one is able to separate out the information that is giving rise to any specific idea and take measures to counteract its tendency to arise.<br />
					The idea of 'cause' is a sublimation of the idea of self. It requires that there be a force there independent of any given thing which is the 'cause' force. That is the idea of the ultimate existence of a thing and that is a sublimation of the idea of self. That is also at the root of the idea of a Creator God. This is also the problem with the translation of <i>'dhatū'</i> as 'element': it implies an on-going ultimate existence of a thing.<br />
					Elsewhere the word most consistently translated 'cause,' <i>'hetu',</i> is also being translated so carelessly. The word actually means 'driving force' which is a much clearer idea of what is actualy happening in almost every case where 'cause' is used today in whatever field. The distinction is most helpful when trying to figure out the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i> The idea is that among factors that result in each phase, there is one which if missing, will prevent the arising of the next phase. The existence of forms of being <i>(bhavas)</i> does not 'cause' living in a form of being, but without forms of being there would be no living in any form of being.<br />

					The Buddha teaches that it is because of data, the available information, that perceptions, views and thoughts arise. Mrs. Rhys Davids translates <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/maha_dhatu.htm"><i>'dhatū'</i></a> as 'element'. I have used 'information'. The question is: Is <i>'dhatū'</i> a thing or material object, or is it that which can be known about things or material objects — A property or characteristic?<br />
					Here what would be understood using 'element' is that there is a big mass of 'blindness-element' out there that plops down on someone to cause him not to see what is there to see. This is no more the case than it is the case that there is a chariot there apart from its constituent parts. Solidity is a <i>dhatū,</i> but in a body of water that has become frozen, there is no 'thing' there that is the solidity of that water. The idea that it is 'solid' is generated within the perceiver through comprehension of the properties of resistance, impenatrability, etc. So here in this sutta the idea is that there is information there which can be resorted to or not; that the individual, reacting to sense experience with liking or disliking, blinds himself to information that would otherwise inform him with a more neutral view.<br />
					In the previous suttas in this series, beginning at <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_14_dhatusamyutta.htm#p1">SN 2.14.1</a> we learn one of the most important things there is to know about how to set the mind upright: that the diversity in perceptions comes from the diversity in data (my then translation of <i>'dhatū'</i>) and not the other way around. The eye comes into contact with a visible object and visual consciousness arises. To the mind, Eye, visible object and visual consciousness are all received as <i>'dhatū':</i> information.<br />
					The individual begins with the belief at heart that he is the creator of the created. He thinks therefore he is. Things enter his world upon his perception of them. With the information that perception arises from objects and not the other way around, the tendency is to say that one's world is created by an external force. But the Buddha tells us that it is '<i>within</i> this fathom long body that the beginning of the world, the end of the world and the escape from the world is to be found.' [<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p45">AN 4.45</a>] What has happened? Without noticing it the idea of self has, in its effort at 'self'-preservation, switched sides. A visual object comes into contact with my eye and creates my visual consciousness of that object. Put a billion or so of those perceptions together and snap fingers or breath into a lump of clay and there I am. "I did not create the world", "The world created me." But all that has happened in reality is that the properties of sensations, perceptions and consciousness have arisen from contact in conjunction with the view-property "I am this way" or "I am that way." A little information is a dangerous thing!<br />

He identifies two groups with opposing characteristics. It is interesting to note that although this sutta is, in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> named <i>'Das'aṅgika'</i> <i>'ten-aṅgika'</i> and the previous sutta is <i>'Aṭṭhaṅgika'</i> <i>'eight-aṅgika'</i> (no <i>'magga'</i>) Mrs. Rhys Davids translates 'eightfold' and 'ten factors' while Bhk. Bodhi translates 'eightfold path' and 'ten factors'. I believe that in the same way we do not go around putting titles on the various conversations we have with people, that the suttas and such various lists as we find throughout the suttas were only given names when repeated reference to them made naming them a convenience. So it is a reasonable conclusion to think that what we have here is early relative to those places where the Eight-Dimensional Way or the Ariya Eight Dimensional Way and the <i>(Ā)Sikkhāpada</i> are referred to by those names. Again to my mind this would tend to suggest that these 'tedious repetitions' were early, not later 'monkish' additions. This theory is confounded by the fact that in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.011.pali.bd.htm#p1">the first sutta</a> (also found in the <i>Saṃyutta Nikāya</i>) the <i>'Aṭṭhaṅgika'</i> is called <i>ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo.</i> Could it possibly be that the first sutta was subject to 'monkish' tampering? To attain the Eye of <i>Dhamma</i> it is necessary only to have the first three of the Four Truths (to hear that 'this' is pain, that this pain has its origin in thirst, and that it can be brought to an end by ending thirst), but the fourth truth, being the Way to do it, is not explained in detail sufficient to make it comprehensible. Even allowing that <i>aṅgikas</i> 2-8 could be guessed at thinking the intent was 'the highest form in which these things are practiced) the first <i>aṅgika,</i> <i>'ditthi'</i> or 'view,' was unique to Gotama and would not have been known in any way prior to this utterance. But the fact is that the <i>Magga</i> is, in its details, carefully and uniquely contstructed in units of intentional not-doing. No other contemporary set of instructions for attaining the goal of solving the problem of rebirth and pain in existence was constructed in this way. The <i>Magga</i> without knowledge of its details is, if not useless in attaining the goal, almost as difficult a task as becoming self-awakened without a teacher. It leaves up to the individual to determine what, exactly is <i>'sammā'</i> 'consummate' this and that. And while that will in fact be helpful, it will not likely result in the intentional not-doing of all behavior intended to cause personal existence that is required for the goal. So this problem reaches another <i>aṅgika</i> dimension: those places where it is given without the details look to be places where the details were assumed to be known or where it was assumed that they would be explained by the leaders of groups. Those places in the suttas where the details are given are relatively infrequent. All sorts of questions arise when thinking about this. Where were the details first introduced? Was the <i>Magga</i> itself a later compilation from the various <i>aṅgikas</i> as developed individually or in groups? Why is there so little emphasis on the details of the <i>Magga</i> as a unit? Why the distinction between the eight-dimensioned and the ten-dimensioned? And why the change from 'fold' to 'factor'? What was the impulse that lead Bhk. Bodhi to insert 'Path' where it was not in the <i>Pāḷi</i>? But as to that, just remember: 'a rose by any other name will smell as sweet.' This is all just a matter of curiosity.<br />

A footnote in the next sutta references the commentary in explaining the meaning as 'solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion.' Properties, characteristics, bits of information, not 'elements.' (Mrs. Rhys Davids use of 'elements' is here most easily explained but it should be seen, and will be shown in the following suttas that what is being spoken of here is not a thing in and of itself, but a property of things, and that using the translation 'element' points in the wrong direction.) Here I return to the issue of translating <i>'dhatū'</i> as element to point out to the reader that he should be aware that in Volume 3 of the <i>Samyutta,</i> the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm"><i>Khandha Vagga,</i></a> Woodward has used 'element' for his translation of <i>'khandha'.</i> We need to be on the alert and allow for this sort of inconsistency at this point in the progress towards a translation with a uniform vocabulary which, if it ever is to be, is still some time in the future.<br />
					One more thing: Mrs. Rhys Davids and Bhk. Bodhi's translation of <i>'vāyo-dhātū'</i> as 'air ~' is just wrong. It is 'wind' or 'wave-form' or 'motion' or the like. Air does not convey the idea of motion which is necessary for understanding this property. The <i>'vāyo'</i> concentration device, for example, is to look on the motion of leaves blown in the wind. One determines if there is life in a living being through the presence of the <i>tejo</i> and <i>vāyo dhātū.</i> Air exists in dead things.<br />

The arrogance and 'superiority' of this woman is beyond comprehension. If she had stuck to her own discipline she would have emerged a hero, but she has felt a need to 'explain Buddhism' to the world and has by that ventured into territory where she is simply an incompetent. She has passionately embraced her own view of what Gotama's teaching <i>'must'</i> have been all about and is defending that view against all comers. What she has done is explained from a theoretical intellectual viewpoint based on her own experience and preconceptions what can only be explained properly by a practitioner. Its like a lawyer, untrained and inexperienced in any aspect of medicine, who writes an introductory text on medicine. For her, everything that does not agree with her view is a later 'monkish' construction (she want's Gotama, who spent most of his time addressing <i>bhikkhus,</i> to have directed his teaching pimarily to the less interested common man), and by that she manages to ignore incalculably more than is accommodated by her view.<br />

The meaning possible to draw from the three translations (including Bhk. Bodhi's) is different in ... um ... exquisitely subtle ways each of which will yield a radically different form of practice. At a certain point in your studies it will be vital, at the least, to understand that there are differences of opinion as to what is being said. I will try and be helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four of the five 'stockpiles' <i>(rūpa, vedanā, saññā, saṅkhāra)</i> (<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panc_upadana_kkhandha.htm"><i>khandhas</i></a>) are to be dealt with:</p>

					<p class="f4">Per Woodward: A monk is possessed of the power to penetrate the subtlty <i>[sokhu-m-māni]</i> of body, feeling, perception, activities; he beholds no other power more excellent, he aspires for no other power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Per Bhk. Bodhi: A <i>bhikkhu</i> possesses supreme exquisitness of form, feeling, perception, volitional activities, he perceives no exquisiteness more excellent, and does not yearn for any other exquisiteness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Olds: A beggar has beheld a most exquisite shape, experience, perception, own-making, cannot conceive of a higher exquisite shape, etc., and aspires to no higher exquisite shape, etc..</p>

					<p class="f4">The problem with Woodward's translation begins and ends with the fact that there is no mention of any sort of power in the <i>Pāḷi.</i> He is giving us an interpretation in reliance on his understanding of what is said in the commentary: [Per footnote: "Comys. read <i>sukhumāni</i> and define as: 'knowledge of how to penetrate the subtle characteristics.] By this he has, I believe, short-circuited the intent of the sutta and deprived the reader of the little itty bit of visibility of the absolutely essential piece of knowledge it provides. (I'll get to that in a minute and you can judge for yourself.)</p>

					<p class="f4">The problem with Bhk. Bodihi's translation is that he has the <i>bhikkhu</i> possessing (having become in himself, most exquisite in) these forms, etc. which perceptions would justly be called vanity, self-deception and manifestation of a belief in self. He footnotes; My <i>[insert in italics]:</i></p>

					      <p class="in2">"Mp's explanation <i>[see quote above]</i> seems to me problematic. I would identify exquisiteness of form with the form perceived in the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> exquisiteness of feeling with the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling occurring in the fourth <i>jhāna</i> and the formless attainments, exquisiteness of perception with the perception in the base of nothingness, and exquisiteness of volitional activities with the residual volitional activities in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception."</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting aside that these are just guesses (he says "I would identify" not "These are"), Bhk. Bodhi is trying to identify what is the exquisite form, etc. being spoken of. If the attainment of a certain state had been the point of the sutta, it is certain that that would have been stated. There are much more direct and less uncertain ways to get the states Bhk. Bodhi mentions than leaving it up to the subjective judgment of the individual. But the Buddha says: <i>These</i> are the exquisites. In some way what we have in front of us must be made to be those exquisites. The meaning of a sutta needs to be found in the wording as it is found ... for the most part, except where there is an obvious connection between suttas, a sutta will have been delivered to an audience which might in its lifetime hear that sutta and only that sutta. Further, if the prose part of the sutta is to be taken alone, Bhk. Bodhi's translation is making the Buddha say that these four exquisites, attained by the <i>bhikkhu,</i> are the most exquisite exquisites, which is not the case. The most exquisite form of a <i>bhikkhu</i> does not compare to the most exquisite form of the Buddha, for an example. The most exquisite form of a <i>bhikkhu</i> at one minute will not be the same as his form will be in the next minute so it will not be possible for him to form the non-desire to have any other exquisiteness since he doesn't have the one he thinks he has in the first place. ... and for many other similar reasons this cannot be the meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">My suggestion is that the prose part of the sutta is an instruction in how to identify when one has perceived forms, etc., in a way which requires no further exploration of form to know that one has seen sufficient to understand form as it is. "Having seen the best, I can leave the rest." It is not necessary to have seen the most exquisite (the absolute best) form of all forms, and it is not necessary to have perceived form in any particular state, and it is not necessary to have become form in any particular state, to have reached the point where a form is perceived as exquisite, it is simply necessary to have seen such a form as satisfies. That is, to re-interpret the quote from the commentary: having seen forms in a way that satisfies provides a basis for insight into the characteristics of forms. Or one might say gives the power to penetrate the subtlties of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the sum total of the sutta, but there is a verse that follows which possibly clarifies and certainly confuses the meaning. It says:<br />
					Per Woodward: If he knows the subtlty of form, and sees various things about feelings, perceptions and activities, the monk lives in peace in his final body having conquered Māra.<br />
					Per Bhk. Bodhi: Having known the exquisitness of form, and seeing various things about feelings, perceptions, and volitional activities, the <i>bhikkhu</i> lives in peace, bears his final body, having conquered Māra.<br />
					Olds: Knowing exquisite form, and understanding certain things about experience and perception he knows that the own-made is painful and not self and aspires to peace, to bearing his final body and to conquering Māra.</p>

					<p class="f4">Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi essentially agree, I dispute. But the real problem here is that this is only one case of what should be four. We should be finding here that: Knowing exquisite form, exquisite experience, exquisite perception and exquisite own making, and seeing certain things about experience and perception (and I would add 'form') he understands that the own-made is not self and he aspires to peace, bearing his final body and to conquering Māra ... or ... there should be four separate stanzas, one each for exquisite form, exquisite experience, exquisite perception, and exquisite own-making, each with a concluding set of factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">My guess? The commentator who invented the explanation used by Woodward and objected-to by Bhk. Bodhi (but actually accepted by him in the form of the verses) inserted the verses intending to reveal the meaning, (that is, the verse is the original commentary). As commentary he would not necessarily need to work out all the variations.</p>

					Linked to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.017.pali.bd.htm"><i>Pāḷi.</i></a> The Buddha describes four ways of going wrong. In this and the next three suttas Woodward translates <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/gati-agati.htm"><i>'gati'</i></a> as 'bourn' which has the effect in these cases, where the term is <i>'agati'</i> of turning these suttas upside down. One way of describing the aim of the system is to say that it is to achieve the state where there are no further 'bourns' and one sure way not to achieve that goal is to take hold of desires, hatred, stupidity and give reign to fear. But by Woodwards phrasing this is just what one is to do. Of course the meaning is that these are the four ways of going wrong or getting things or behaving incorrectly or the acting against 'good form' that is mentioned in the <i>gāthās.</i><br />
					If the <i>gāthās</i> were eliminated, the possible meanings for each sutta are dual and opposite depending on whether one understands the intent to be pointing to the goal of the <i>arahant</i> or a worldly goal and whether one is to understand the subject as 'ways of going wrong' or 'what you get from going wrong' i.e., destinies. Aside from the <i>gāthās</i> there is no reason to think that these double meanings were not deliberate, if not, perhaps, hidden to most under the meaning as we hear it now. This sutta paints half of a picture. The other half is in the next sutta, and the sutta following that combines the two. I have translated that sutta just to put in my thought about how it should be read. Otherwise Bhk. Thanissaro's translation would do. The fourth in the series gives a variation which looks to my eye as though it was intended to point to what is to be understood in the lot as it gives an every-day example.

And in this case he adds emphasis by showing that disparaging these four subjects one to ridicule.<br />
					We may have in this sutta a valuable opportunity to clarify our understanding of some important terms by their comparison with the factors said to be present when they are absent.<br />
					<i>'Sammā-sati'</i> for example, is contrasted with forgetfulness <i>'muṭṭha-s-sati'</i> and <i>'asampajāna'</i> 'non-cognizance' (lack of understanding), but also, according to PED, lack of mindfulness and attentiveness. We do have one word that means 'remember', 'mind', and 'pay attention to' in the word: 'mind' — (The mind, mind your manners, mind the children). We should probably use that in spite of the fact that it sounds somewhat old fashioned. Old fashioned is sometimes more clear than the modern, and this is especially important in this system which is so mathematically constructed. <i>'Sammā-samādhi'</i> is contrasted with <i>'asamāhitaṃ'</i> literally 'non-confligration' which might seem like a good thing, but the meaning is 'not-kindled,' 'not lit,' (for which remember that one meaning of <i>'jhāna'</i> is 'to burn') but also not-gathered together, composed, concentrated, collected, and <i>'vibbhanta-cittaṃ'</i> 'a roving heart'.<br />
					I have spoken out against the translation of <i>'samādhi'</i> as concentration which is only one factor of <i>samādhi</i> and suggested 'serenity:'</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2"><i>From Latin <i>sernus,</i> clear, fair, calm (of weather) peaceful, cheerful; akin to OHG <i>serawēn,</i> to become dry; Gr: <i>χερον</i> dry land. 1. completely clear, fine, or balmy suggesting or conducive to calm peacefulness free of storms or unpleasant change. Shining bright and steady and unobscured. 2. marked by or suggestive of utter calm and unruffled repose or quietude without suggestion of agitation, trouble, fitful activity, or sudden change.</i> — Websters</p>

					<p class="f4">After consideration of these contrasting terms, I believe serenity is the better choice. It contains the germ of concentration while it encorporates ideas such as clarity and calm and lack of disruption caused by activities all of which are aspects of <i>samādhi.</i> One might raise the argument against this choice that there is the existence of <i>'miccha-samādhi';</i> or 'low' or 'contrary' or 'mistaken' (but not wrong!) <i>-samādhi,</i> and that where there can be misdirected concentration, how is it possible to have misdirected serenity? My response is that it is possible, as in the case of the serenity that sometimes occurs to those in battle and those engaged in highly worldly activities ... I'm thinking of painting, what were you thinking of? Gotama is in this sutta speaking of <i>'Sammā-samadhi'.</i> That which is less than perfect serenity could easily be characterized as being less than perfectly composed and subject to a roving heart.<br />

Drawing near he asks Gotama about what sort of being he may be and is told that he is beyond 'being' and is Buddha.<br />
					There are a couple of interesting things about this sutta aside from the lesson. First: though the Arahant is said to be 'trackless' here Dona is able to see his footprints. The commentary aparently attempts to explain that the footprints are invisible, but that this Brahman can 'see'. This is exactly backwards of the essence of the meaning of 'trackless'. Trackless should be understood as a matter of leaving no traces indicating that anything that was done by the 'trackless' one has been done from lust, hate, or stupidity. It is not a matter of leaving no footprints. The need to make Gotama into a supernatural being is to miss the real magic in what Gotama realized.<br />
					The other thing is that Woodward speculates that this is the Dona to whom was given the Buddha's bowl on his death. I wonder what happened to this bowl?<br />

					This sutta looks like it should just be the second half of the previous sutta. It might be interesting to some to note that in the <i>Pāḷi</i> there is an unusual effort made to make this repetition of the sutta read like a modern narative. Where usually what we find in such cases is an exact repetition of the events as they were previously told, here there is inserted such transitional phrases as: "When he had said that, I responded ..." So now we have three ways repetitions are found: strict repetition, encapsulation ('and they repeated all that had happened') and this narative form.<br />

					The veneration given to parents in the Buddha's time is almost unimaginable today — to our great disadvantage when it comes time to review one's life and think about those who have been of great service to us ... not to mention the guilt emanating from neglect or actual mistreatment. The names for mother and father given here are of deep psychological importance. For the infant, the parents are indeed the Creator, the first teachers, the first gods and for the service they do for their child when it is young and helpless they are indeed worthy of offerings. Even the most neglectful parents have given their child life, food, clothing and much else. Most parents will have done more for their child than anyone else in the world will ever do. Those ideas which were not well articulated in infancy do not abandon the individual but underlie and support his entire relationship with the world throughout his life and returning again in old age they ask for their due and for the one who has neglected his parents this is a heavy debt to pay. If you have living parents now, make an effort now. Do not regret hereafter.<br />

					A <i>bhikkhu</i> has died of snake-bite so the Buddha gives the <i>bhikkhus</i> a 'charm' to project friendliness towards snakes. Footnote four in Ms. Horner's <i>Vinaya</i> version (below) gives a good idea of what is at work:</p>

					<p class="in2">Friendliness, <i>mettā,</i> and the three other modes of the <i>brahma-vihāras</i> are transferred from the mind of the suffuser to that of the being who is suffused or infused.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a phenomena that is the inverse of mind-reading: Thought projection. Ideas are things. They float around out there available to everyone and only become 'one's own' with identification. If a thought is strongly generated by one person (being) it can be identified with by others. Think of the universe as a gigantic brain in which signals are ever-present and where beings are like signal-receiving, but also signal-boosting stations.<br />
					I recommend reading this sutta in the <i>Pāḷi</i> even if you do not understand the <i>Pāḷi</i> ... though having the translation right there it is a simple matter to see what is what. The actual charm is the centered verses below the short introductory story. I also believe this 'charm' will be much more effective if said with comprehension in the <i>Pāḷi</i> if only because it is really 'charming' to the ear. Relax and you can see how a snake would find it so.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.068.wood.pts.htm">Devadatta,</a> Woodward translation.<br />
					The Buddha likens the fate of Devadatta to several things that bear fruit to their own destruction and the destruction of others.<br />
					There seems to me to be a problem here with Woodward's translation of <i>'parābhavāya'.</i> The plantain, bamboo, reed and mule are said to <i>'atta-vadhāya'</i> 'destruction of self' and <i>'parābhavāya'</i> which Woodward translates 'destruction of others'. That Devadatta brought about problems for others is obvious, but not so obvious is the harm done to others by these other things. PED just has 'destruction.' 'Others' is not found in the word or outside it. Bhk. Bodhi has 'to his own ruin and destruction' which looks to be the better translation. Maybe 'to his own ruin and general <i>(para)</i> destruction. The problem here is holding on to <i>'atta'</i> as 'self'. (little joke).<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.069.wood.pts.htm">Effort,</a> Woodward translation.<br />
					The Buddha defines the four best ways of making effort. Here is a good opportunity to see the way Gotama has constructed his system so as to make it 'helpful in the beginning, helpful in the middle and helpful at the end'. What he has done is worded the formula so as to make it generic. Taken as it is, in the beginning, the idea of what is an 'unprofitable state' and what is a 'profitable state' is left undeclared so that it applies to each individual as he himself defines it. That in turn will be a value which is under a constant state of upward revision because no matter how low the individual begins, by pointing himself to what he believes at that point is a profitable state, he moves himself forward to some degree. That is true even in the case of very low ideas of 'profit' such as increase in pleasure or wealth. In no long time success in the pursuit of a low level profit will be seen as the pursuit of the unprofitable. It is a natural course of things, for example, that the sensualist will discover that sensual pleasure is enhanced by abstinance. And if initially only to increase his pleasure he will turn to letting go and the track from there is steadily in the upward direction. It is also the natural course of things that the acquisition of wealth leads to the perception that there are higher degrees and forms of wealth. Because making the effort will result in the gain of profit or the elimination of the unprofitable, etc. there will be instilled faith in the formula and further effort, and so on. Just by beginning a benevolent cycle is set rolling. At a later point one will discover that what is considered 'profitable' in this system is the further set of generic instructions found in the Eightfold Path and later still in the Seeker's Path. Always the particulars will be left to the perception of the indiviual even when these latter are given in detail: the details are themselves generic in form.<br />

					A wonderful sutta though of a sort likely to be discredited by many of 'modern' thought. The Buddha outlines the effects of leaders of men both good and bad. It has been pointed out here a few times that what needs to be seen is that this world is a work of the collective imagination and the laws of physics that govern it are, so far from being immutable, highly subject to agreement as to what is and what is not possible. Somewhere else here it has been pointed out that however much there is currently disagreement that there is such a thing as the influence on natural events of the behavior of men, what we have today is a corrupt leadership leading a corrupt populace into further corruption while at the same time there is drastic weather alteration, alteration of the position of the earth's pole and the manner in which that alters perception of the courses of the moon and sun, stress on food production and a deterioration of over-all health in the populous. (Some will argue with that last, but I would say that what we have, in so far as there is an increase in longevity, is the prolongation of the lives of a much weaker people through mechanical means. Left to nature, the lifespan of people would be decreasing. People are for the most part trading quality of life for length of life.)<br />

					This is a hair-raising sutta. It was delivered by Gotama towards the very end of his life. It is jam-packed with interesting information. And it is a first rate work of literary/oratory art by any standards. A <i>bhikkhu</i> who left the order is going around saying that there is nothing extraordinary about Gotama or his doctrine. Gotama, hearing of this person's opinion replies with a wide-ranging rebuttal listing the wonderous aspects of his awakening and the scope of his knowledge.<br />
					There is one statement made in this sutta which has the potential to cause great confusion caused by the current translations including my own. In the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.012.horn.pts.htm#p34">section</a> where Gotama is describing his ability to see the destinies [literally 'gettings'] of persons (Ms. Horner translates <i>gati</i> as 'bourn' which is, as they said in those days, an 'unfortunate' translation as it relates to the Arahant who's entire purpose is to escape 'bourns'), the final sort of person he describes is the one who destroys the corrupting influences [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.012.horn.pts.htm#p40">see here</a>] [<i>āsavas</i>], that is, the Arahant, and who by that enjoys <i>feelings</i> that are exclusively pleasant. <a id="vedana">The term translated 'feelings'</a> is <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vedana.htm"><i>'vedana'.</i></a> This is the translation most often used. I have translated this 'sensation' and 'sense experience' because <i>'vedana'</i> is most frequently associated with sense-experience. It is the term between 'touch' (or contact) and 'thirst' in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> and consists of the experience of pleasure, pain, or not-pain-but-not-pleasure, and in the case of the first two it is something which must be let go to attain Arahantship. So what is being spoken of here? The explanation is that <i>'vedana'</i> is of two sorts: that which is downbound to the world, which would be sense-experience or experience through the senses, and that which is a consequence of letting go (actually <i>'nirāmisa'</i> meaning putting down meat, or 'carnal-free'). (These two modes of <i>'vedana'</i> are to be found in the <a href="http://localhost/themozone/bd/dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p11"><i>Satipaṭṭhana sutta</i></a> and elsewhere.) So in the case of the use of this term in this sutta  the translation 'sensation,' implying experience through the senses, would be ... um ... 'unfortunate'. 'Feeling' with an even stronger association with contact, is also not good. The better translation would be, in all cases, just 'experience' (e.g.: contact of the eye with a visible object gives rise to pleasant experience, unpleasant experience, experience which is neither unpleasant nor pleasant). The word <i>'vedana'</i> itself means 'the given experience' or the 'thrill-given' or 'the given thrill' associated with the experience of life, especially that experienced by one who attains awakening. This is the only case that I am aware of where the experience of the Arahant is directly put in terms of <i>'vedana'.</i> It is helpful that we do have this one case at least, in that it clarifies the understanding of the carnal-free sort of ... experience. When the <i>'vedana'</i> are numbered as eighteen, [see SN <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_36_vedanasamyutta.htm#p22">4.36.22</a>] the 'six forms of detachment <i>[upekkha]</i> relating to giving up [of each of the six senses] would be the experiences of the Arahant (or one experiencing temporary release); when the <i>vedanas</i> are numbered as thirty-six, the eighteen related to giving up include six each of pleasure, pain, and detachment. In this latter case, understanding this through MN 12, the experience of the Arahant would be exclusively the experiences of pleasure because he no longer is in danger of the experience of pleasure associated with detachment turning into the experience of pain (which is the case of temporary release) because of its ending, and he is at all times and in all ways detached. ... or so I understand this. I see this very much as one might imagine the case of living in anti-matter. The Arahant has the not-experience of all that which exists in the world. Because he is free from the hazard of the matter world, which is ending, his experience is endlessly pleasant.<br />

					I will be changing this translation as I go around. ... well, since writing this I have made some changes and have also found that this is easier conceived of than accomplished. We use the term 'experience' far more broadly than to indicate sensations at the senses and the context often requires this to be made clear. If there is a word that will serve here I do not yet have it and meanwhile I will likely tend towards the use of 'sense-experience' where it is the sensations experienced through the senses that is intended.</p>

					Six powers of the Buddha by which he claims leadership, has confidence in addressing any group, and rolls on the wheel of <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					The key to getting the real feel for this sutta is in understanding the term '<i>yathābhūta.</i> ' 'suchas-it lives' Hare: 'knows as fact'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'understands as it really is'; Bhk. Thissaro: 'as actually present'. PED: <i>bhūta</i> grown, become; born, produced; nature as the result of becoming. I suggest 'such as it is/was'. We only need the 'really, in fact, actually' because we do not believe the statement on its face. This emphasis is not in the term itself. And this is the point of this sutta, that is that in three sets of six heavily emphasized statements the Buddha is saying that the powers he is claiming for himself here are things he sees in the same way as any other phenomenon observable in the world is seen. That is why this is called a 'Lion's Roar'; it is a public declaration of some virtue in one's self for the sake of eliminating doubt. Like <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.033.wood.pts.htm">the Lion's roar as it leaves its den</a> in the evening to go out into the jungle to take the evening air, it is a strong reminder to creatures large and small as to what they are dealing with and to make themselves safe. In our world where the lie is so commonplace that we no longer believe anything, it is hard to see that in Gotama's time, where even most criminals if asked if they committed a crime would admit it for shame at lying, to make a false asertion, or even a self-deceptive asertion (saying something that is not true), so many times in succession without going crazy on the spot would be a virtual impossibility. This sutta, and those of this type, are close relatives to the magic command/wish/demand made by an 'act of truth'; 'Let lightening strike me dead if such and such is not the truth, or let my people go.' ... usually requiring the public revelation of some deep personal secret.<br />

							<p>One of the powers as translated here is that the Buddha: ...knows the stain, purity and emergence in <i>musing, deliverance and concentration attainments.</i>" This (<i>italicized phrase</i>) is, in the <i>Pāḷi</i>: <i>jhāna-vimokkha-samādhi-samāpattinaṃ.</i> Note the hyphens. Does this mean, in stead: <i>"jhāna-deliverance-samādhi-attainments"</i> — one compound term? ("<i>jhāna</i>-release-serenity-attainment"), a single idea, not three? The problems in attaining, clarification of, and emergence from a state of release in serenity attained through <i>jhāna?</i> If not, what is the implied distinction between <i>'jhāna'</i> and <i>'samādhi'?</i> See also in this regard: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p12">MN 12.</a> Bhks.

Bodhi's <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/mn/mn.012.ntbb.wp.htm#n12">note</a> there apparently relying on commentary ignores <i>'samādhi'</i> and explains the releases as liberations (the <i>vimokkha,</i> 'releases' include the four immaterial <i>jhānas</i> and the attainment of the ending of perception and <i>experience</i>) and <i>samāpatti</i> as 'the attainments': of <i>jhāna,</i> the four immaterial attainments and the cessation of perception and <i>vedana</i> (the cessation of perception and experience or is this 'ending-perception-experience' that is, ending the experiences arising from perception?). In any case, this translated as three concepts amounts to a heap of confusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another interesting thing to note in this sutta (ignoring Hare's translation of <i>samādhi</i> as 'concentration') is the statement that these powers, which include the three 'visions' associated with Arahantship, are attained only by those who have (or who 'are') <i>'samādhi.'</i> Depending on how one understands this term this can be problematic. <i>Samādhi</i> defined as the four <i>jhānas,</i> (but the term was not <i>'sammā samādhi'</i>) it is saying that the four <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for arahantship. Defined as serenity, the highest form of which is the <i>jhānas,</i> and the three modes of which are ambitionlessness, signlessness and emptiness, attainment of the four <i>jhānas,</i> or all four, might not be absolutely required. The first <i>jhāna</i> would certainly qualify as <i>samādhi</i> or serenity.</p>

It is discouraging because it has tainted this work with bias (the desire to have works that are not original documentation considered as original documentation) and allowed in doubt.

I have heard the same thing by way of a Jamaican seer who said they were as large as football fields or even larger and that they sometimes took days to pass through and during that time many people would enter strange moods they couldn't explain. [Edit: see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.100.hare.pts.htm#fn5">AN 5.100 n.5</a> for a case like this but of a higher sort of birth than the Ghost and which did not cause any disturbances in this world when it passed.]<br />
					Imagine the effect on the <i>bhikkhus</i> there as this routine was carried out day after day for 21 days. The Buddha notes that had he told of these things himself he might not have been believed, but by being spoken of by Mahā-Moggallāna and confirmed by Gotama in front of Lakkhana and (probably a growning number of) others that were likely present, there is a triangulation set up which makes doubt very difficult.</p>

					The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> text beginning at §12 where the <i>Brahma-viharas</i> are linked to the <i>Sambojjhangas,</i> is completely unrelated to this sutta as found in the PTS <i>Pāḷi,</i> the CSCD or the <i>Pāḷi</i> text used by Bhk. Bodhi.</p>

					A wide-ranging very famous sutta that begins with a forceful teaching on the dangers of indulgence in sense pleasures. This sutta contains two famous similes: the simile of the snake illustrating how a wrong grasp of the <i>Dhamma</i> is like taking hold of a poisonous snake from the wrong end; and the simile of the raft illustrating how the <i>Dhamma</i> should be used to attain its ends and then be let go. The sutta concludes with a thorough examination of the way 'not self' should be considered.<br />
					The interesting question here is why would Arittha hang on so stubbornly to his view about the harmlessness of sense-pleasure indulgence? It is possible of course that he was just a fool (but he was not unskilled in meditation, see: <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.006.olds.bd.htm#fn1">SN 5.54.6</a> where Gotama thought enough of him to give him special instruction on the in-and-out-breathing practice). But the likelihood is that he was trapped by a perception that befalls one who holds the view that there is no self. In this view a number of very dangerous conclusions can be reached because there is perceived to be no individuality there to experience the consequences of deeds. This would justify the simile of the snake and would explain the long dissertation that follows concerning the 'not-self' position. The presence here of the simile of the raft might also be explained as a hint to Arittha that if even the <i>Dhamma</i> could be let go, he could certainly let go his view. There is also in this sutta a very interesting remark made by Gotama as to constructing theories about the self where he states that even if there were a self that was incomprehensible, it would be foolishness to form theories about it. This statement is a little obscure and is made only in this sutta and has caused some confusion. Ms. Horner's translation is the most potentially misleading. The idea is that it is shown that examining things as they really are, there is no comprehension of a self possible, <i>but</i> even if there were a self that was incomprehensible, it would be foolish to speculate about it because its paramaters could not be encompassed by speculations made within the scope of comprehension. This is not, as Ms. Horner's translation would indicate, an asertion that there is a self.</p>

					<p>The profession of amity, according to Buddhist doctrine, was no mere matter of pretty speech.</p>

					<p>It was to accompany and express a psychic suffusion of the hostile man or beast or spirit with benign, fraternal emotion — with <i>mettā.</i> For strong was the conviction, from <i>Sutta</i> and <i>Vinaya</i> to Buddhaghosa's <i>Visuddhi-Magga,</i> that 'thoughts are things,' that psychical action, emotional or intellectual, is capable of working like a force among forces.<br />

He asks Gotama why it is that this is no longer the case and is told that it is because at this time the people are obsessed with lusts, depravities and wrong views resulting in a number of calamaties that depopulate the earth.<br />
					A tough sutta for modern man to digest for several reasons. Nobody I think will argue that the people today are not as depraved as described, and that that results in wars, but that this depravity affects the weather and crops and causes the unleashing of demonic beings will be harder to see. And then there is the issue of feeding such a dense population ... and this was speaking of a time when the lifespan of man was in the tens of thousands of years.<br />
					How can this be seen? This world is a work of the imagination, individual and collective. The individual has no way to know the nature of 'the real world', what he can know is simply the three experiences through the senses, what he 'sees' and 'hears' and 'tastes' and 'touches' has no more concrete reality to it than a dream, but because man desires to live collectively he agrees to believe the world is of a certain nature, possesses certain properties beyond solidity, liquidity, heat and light, motion, space and consciousness. Thus the apparent world is one which is arrived at by consensus*. That consensus changes over time. That's how.<br />
					*Actually that consensus is a consensus that this world is one which is arrived at by consensus; examined closely it will be seen that outside the <i>Saṅgha</i> there are hardly two people in the world that agree with each other about almost anything.<br />

Well its more than just a discussion. Gotama performs an act of magic power which it is a challenge for the reader to see and which converts Sangarava, and there is also here a direct statement as to Gotama's possession of varous sorts of magic powers.

					Gotama speaks of three terrors of the common people and then shows how their fears go too far in that sometimes there is a happy ending; he follows that by speaking of three terrors not subject to remediation through wishes; and then he points the way to overcome terrors.<br />
					This sutta speaks to a deep psychological terror, not simply to the fears caused by natural calamity, but the fears that arise facing death of the self or a loved one; twin drives which underlie the search for rebirth driven by the great bond between mothers and sons.<br />
					There are a couple of very difficult terms to understand in this sutta and Woodward, Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi and myself have as a result each got the intent of it and the construction of the logic differently. To my mind the greatest danger comes from Woodward's understanding of the conclusion which points to the idea as being a way for mother's and sons to be united. This is not the idea of the sutta. The idea is the overcoming of the terror, not the happy solution to the disunity. Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi and I are at least in agreement concerning this aspect.<br />
					I have done a translation which I believe evades the pitfalls of this sutta and shows the way Gotama developed his idea.<br />

					A variation on the teaching given in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p65">AN 3.65:</a> The <i>Kesa-puttiya (Kesa-mutti) Suttaṃ,</i> aka The Kalama Sutta. Here, Old Man Nandako teaches two young Brahmins not to go by what is accepted tradition, by hearsay, or great learning, not to go by logic and inference, the appeal of some theory, or because it is held by a venerated teacher, but only when a thing is understood for one's self to be beneficial, blameless, approved of by the wise, things that when done result in happiness and well-being undertake them and live by them. Examples of knowing for one's self are given.<br />
					The sutta ends with the phrase: '<i>brahma-bhūtena attanā viharatī</i>' Which Bhk. Bodhi ("having himself become divine") and Bhk. Thanissaro: ("he abides
					[for the remainder of his last life-span] divinely pure in himself") are attempting to avoid translating as per Woodward: "...abides in experience of bliss, by becoming Brahmā.' "Becoming Brahmā" is problematic because of its implication of a self having attained an individualized rebirth as 'a <i>Brahmā</i> God' as this phrase is understood today by Hindu's. See on this: <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.070.wood.pts.htm#n10">AN 3.070 n.10</a><br />
					What we have here is a good example of the difference between literal translation and interpretive translation. It is where the translator feels the need to interpret that bias can enter the picture and it is for this reason that the <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society translations are invaluable in that the predominant effort of these translators was in the direction of the literal because their primary interest (and measure of excellence) was in the usefulness of the translation in elucidating the language. Interpretation at some level can't be avoided in translation. This is just something to keep in mind as you read. Check back to the <i>Pāḷi</i> where something doesn't feel right, where you suspect you are being molly-coddled, or where translators differ widely or where there is a suspicion that one is being pushed in a certain direction, especially towrads known biases, such as "There is no self."<br />

Picking up the <i>nidana</i> of the first sutta in a chapter, or from the next previous sutta where a <i>nidana</i> is given, for the rest appears called for where the following suttas begin with <i>'Atha kho',</i> 'There then'.

					Linked to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.074.pali.bd.htm"><i>Pāḷi.</i></a> Ānanda describes three methods for ending pain and evading <i>kamma</i> as taught by the Buddha. The key to understanding this sutta is in the phrase: <i>Purāṇañ ca kammaṃ phussa phussa vyantī-karoti.</i> 'And he removes past <i>kamma</i> by way of touch touch.' Repeated contact. There is no explanation in the sutta, and the various translations do not explain well. The idea is that by continuously examining the body, sensations, mental states and the <i>Dhamma</i> and dredging up in memory deeds said and done in the past and examining them from the perspective of <i>Dhamma</i> as it is currently understood [the point of <i>satipaṭṭhana,</i> and an evolving process] one is in effect experiencing the consequences of one's past deeds. At this point by understanding the deed in terms of ethical conduct, the detachment of <i>jhāna</i> and by seeing the freedom in the destruction of the corrupting influences <i>[āsava]</i> the deed is resolved and swept away.<br />
					Understanding this in this way one is able to resolve the paradox presented by the statement made that there is no ending of <i>kamma</i> without experiencing the results thereof, and the case of Arahants apparently being subjected to the consequences of prior bad <i>kamma</i> as in the cases of Devadatta being able to injure the Buddha's toe, Moggliana being murdered, and Angulimala being subjected to assalt ... and other cases.<br />
					How?<br />
					By ethical conduct, the calm detached serenity of <i>jhāna,</i> and insight into the freedom that results from the destruction of the corrupting influences of lust, hate, and stupidity [<i>āsavas</i>] it is possible to become <i>arahant</i> before the ending for the individual of <i>kamma</i> because the body is still there and is subject to it. The Arahant is, by this behavior and insight, subject to no further births after death. That is what distinguishes Arahantship in this life from <i>pari-Nibbāna,</i> and what is meant by the term 'with remainder' when speaking of arahants and non-returners who must experience some delay after death before attaining <i>Nibbāna.</i> Those consequences of former deeds that remain to the <i>khandhas</i> (that is, the individuality,) of what is now the Arahant, however far back in time they may have begun, are forced, because their scope is limited to the <i>khandhas,</i> and there will be no further <i>khandhas,</i> into presenting themselves within the narrow limit of the life of the <i>khandhas</i> of the Arahant that remains. Thus the consequences of former actions are experienced (though in the case of the Arahant, as impersonal phenomena, impinging on the <i>khandhas,</i> but not on the mind), but in proportion to the relationship of the finite life remaining to the unbounded scope of <i>Nibbāna.</i> A similar thing occurs for the Streamwinner, Once-returner, and Non-returner.<br />
					Two similes that were made to make this clear can be found in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p99">AN 3.99</a>. Today [Friday, February 21, 2014 8:50 AM] we can use our common understanding of earth's relationship to outer space as a good simile: Imagine the perspective of an ordinary person here on planet earth. In this case the earth appears vast to the point of feeling unlimited. Then send this same person into orbit in the International Space Station. Here his perspective of earth is radically changed. He has become detached from actual experiences on earth though some may still be visible, and he can see the planet as a finite object in space. Take this person further out in space past the solar system and he will hardly be able to make out the existence of earth at all, let alone experience any disturbance from even cataclysmic things that happen there. Then move this person out beyond the Galaxy, and beyond, and beyond the beyond. The various perspectives can be related to the various changes in perspective from Streamwinner to Arahant, while that which is due to be made manifest on planet earth is confined to planet earth.<br />

					The above four suttas would most profitably be read together. A fifth, below, provides a variation on the last.<br />
					In the first, The Buddha shows how serious commitment to the training in ethical practices interacts with various levels of accomplishment in training the heart and training in wisdom to result in Streamwinning, Once-returning, Non-returning or Arahantship. One who practices a little gets a little; one who practices thoroughly gets much. The fourth provides the definition of what constitutes the higher ethical practice, the higher training of the heart, and the higher training in wisdom. In this sutta Woodward, in note <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.088.wood.pts.htm#n1">#1</a> points out the difficulty raised by the translation of <i>'citta'</i> as 'thought' rather than 'heart,' its literal meaning. The higher <i>'citta'</i> is the training in <i>samādhi,</i> 'serenity, which is a state of the heart more than a state of the mind.<br />
					The first three together, by first providing a broad categorization, second providing a detailed categorization in ascending order and third by providing the same detailed categorization in descending order produce the following picture:</p>

					<p><b><i>Non-Returning</i></b></p>

					<p class="f4">Type 1:</p>

					<p class="f4">Not returning to rebirth as man, attaining the Akaniṭṭha realm he attains Final <i>Nibbāna</i> <i>[parinibbāyī]</i> there.</p>

							<p class="in2">Note: Here the wording is 'upstream he gets the Akaniṭṭha realm' <i>[uddhaṃsoto hoti akaniṭṭha-gāmi].</i> This realm is the highest of the Pure Abodes. It is likely, but not absolutely clear that this means he is reborn directly in the Akaniṭṭha realm. It could be (and the commentaries, Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi assume) he is reborn in lower Pure Abodes and travels upward to this realm. (see discussion below)</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 2:</p>

					<p class="f4">With-own-making <i>[sa-saṅkhāra]</i> Final Nibbāna</p>

							<p class="in2">Note: (<i>saṅkhāra;</i> own-making, confounding, constructing, fabrication. Woodward has "with-" or below "without some trouble"; Bhk. Thanissaro has fabrications, adding '(of exertion)'; Bhk. Bodhi skips right to 'exertion'; presumably these translations are influenced by commentary and work off the translation of <i>saṅkhāra</i> as 'activities'; however this is translated, keep in mind that in this context 'activities' or 'exertion' would imply the intent to create personal experience) attains final <i>Nibbāna,</i><br />
							There is a contradiction in the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> in the ordering of this whole group and again with these two in this sutta and the next. Woodward translating <i>saṅkhāra</i> as 'trouble' creates a logic for reversing the order in the <i>Pāḷi</i> of this sutta to match what is an error in the next, but 'not-<i>saṅkhāra'</i> is higher than <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> always.</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 3:</p>

					<p class="f4">Without-own-making <i>[a-saṅkhāra]</i> Final <i>Nibbāna</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Type 4:</p>

					<p class="f4">Cut-down <i>[upahacca]</i> Final Nibbāna</p>

							<p class="in2">Note: <i>Upahacca</i> 'up-strike' or 'kill', or 'up-cut' or the way we usually have it 'to cut up' or 'cut down' or 'to strike down'; Woodward: 'by reduction of his time'; and relying on commentary: Bhk. Thanissaro: 'on arrival [in a Pure Abode]; Bhk. Bodhi; 'upon landing'; see Bhk. Thanissaro's discussion in his footnote. <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/03_threes/an03.086.than.ati.htm#n4">#4</a>) attains Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> Note that the nature of what is cut down is not specified. What we can infer from the position of this type in the list here and below is that there is less time and effort involved in the attaining of Final <i>Nibbāna</i> for this type than for the previous types.</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 5:</p>

					<p class="f4">In-between <i>[antarā]</i> Final <i>Nibbāna</i></p>

							<p class="in2">Note: There is no confusion here about the term, but the meaning is subject to much debate. One question put is: "Is this an indication of a state between births?" If we see that in the case of this sutta where these last four are put in the descending order thus confirming their relationships to each other as being a progression from lower to higher, and we take the first type as meaning that the non-returner is reborn in some world to progress from that on towards the Akiniṭṭha Realm where there he attains Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> then these four attainments could be understood as:<br />
							Style one: Rebirth in some realm where there is still self-identification or a personal world and thereafter moving on up to the Akiniṭṭha and attaining Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> there;<br />
							Style two: Rebirth in some realm where there is no self-identification or personal world, such as the <i>Ākiñcaññāyatana</i> or <i>N'eva-sannā-na-sannāyatana</i> and thereafter moving on up to the Akiniṭṭha and attaining Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> there;<br />
							Style three: Cutting down, killing off, cutting-back, the remainder of whatever life remains in whatever rebirth has been taken, and thereafter moving on up to the Akiniṭṭha and attaining Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> there.<br />
							Style four: Between death and subsequent rebirth in one of the previous three styles, moving on up to the Akiniṭṭha and attaining Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> there.<br />
							But this is not absolutely required by the wording which is in each case just that in this way (i.e., with own-making) he attains Final <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
							And, again, this is a list put in ascending order, which when (as in the next sutta) it is put in descending order states that <i>it is a failing not to have attained the previous,</i> higher development: [<i>anabhisambhavaṃ:</i> 'not-higher-self development of such'] and it is not possible to construct these last four styles in such a way as not to have them be successively shorter paths to Final <i>Nibbāna</i> than a progression through the Pure Abodes to the Akiniṭṭha. And why should that be objectionable? Is not attaining Arahantship in this life an even shorter path?<br />
							This would still allow the understanding of the first type to be a rebirth in some world below the Akiniṭṭha with a progression to there before the attaining of Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> but this would be inconsistent with the statement in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.022.horn.pts.htm#non-returner">MN 22</a>] that 'all those who have broken the five yokes are spontaneously reborn (no specified location) and attain Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> <i>there.</i><br />
							One more peramater needs to be factord in to the understanding of this list as a progression: that is, that it is frequently stated that the Non-returner reborn in one of the Pure Abodes, attains Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> at some point towards the middle of his lifespan. I am not aware of any place where the lifespan of those reborn in the Pure Abodes is stated. These realms are brahma-lokas, however and are calculated in <i>kappas:</i> aeons.<br />
							The construction we are left with then points to the understanding of the first type as a rebirth directly in the Akiniṭṭha (the wording in MN 22 is that he attains Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> <i>there</i>) and the subsequent types as indicating other, shorter, direct routes to Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> not by way of the Akiniṭṭha.<br />
							Finally, it should be remembered that at any point along any path, (Streamwinner on up) the practitioner might be able to drive himself to destroy the <i>āsavas</i> and become Arahant.</p>

					<p><b>Result:</b></p>

					<p class="f4"><b><i>Arahantship</i></b> in this life.</p>

					<h4>III.2:</h4>

							<p class="in2">Note: This and the following types, the way the sutta reads, have all undertaken the training rules and have developed ethical culture, serenity, and wisdom <i>in full</i> and have eliminated the five yokes. Each is said to have <b><i>not attained</i></b> the preceding [<i>anabhisambhavaṃ:</i> 'not obtaining self development of such']; often put: 'failing that'.</p>

							<p class="in2">Note: The PTS <i>Pāḷi,</i> CSCD and apparently the <i>Pāḷi</i> used by Bhk. Bodhi the order of this section is incorrectly reversed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 1:</p>

					<p class="f4">In-between <i>[antarā]</i> Final Nibbāna</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 2:</p>

					<p class="f4">Cut-down <i>[upahacca]</i> Final Nibbāna</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 4:</p>

					<p class="f4">With-own-making <i>[sa-saṅkhāra]</i> Final Nibbāna</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 5:</p>

							<p class="f4">Not returning to rebirth as man, attaining the Akaniṭṭha realm he attains Final <i>Nibbāna</i> <i>[parinibbāyī]</i> there.</p>

							<p class="in2">Note: In this sutta in the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> there is an elipsis between 'upstream he gets' and 'goes to the <i>Akaniṭṭha</i>' <i>[uddhaṃsoto hoti</i> ... <i>Akaniṭṭhagāmi].</i> This would make these into two different sorts of non-returner. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has 'Going to the <i>Akaniṭṭha</i>' as a separate sentence in this sutta, but not the previous. The CSCD <i>Pāḷi</i> would read as Bhk. Bodhi translates: 'one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭṭha realm,' no elipsis, no separate sentence, one category. I think the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and translation (Woodward places elipses as with the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i>) must be in error here as it is reletively certain that this sutta is to be understood as a repetition in reverse order of the previous sutta. There is no statement in this, at least in these suttas, that the first rebirth subsequent to this life is in the Pure Abodes. The breaking of the five yokes implies only no further rebirth in the 'Lower' Realms. That is defined by PED as meaning the <i>kāma loka</i> or realms where there is experience through the five senses. But since there is at least one case [that of <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm"><i>Anāthapiṇḍika,</i></a> and see also <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.143.than.ati.htm#p1">MN 143,</a> and I believe there is at least one other person who was stated to be a non-returner and also to have been reborn in Tusita] of a non-returner being declared to have been reborn in the Tusita Realm, and since beyond the five yokes is still 'lust for form' <i>[rūpa-rāja]</i> the inference is that the non-returner could be reborn in a realm at least as 'low' as that.</p>

					      <p class="in2">Again note that the order here implies more and more time, effort, involvement, attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 6: (There is no separate category created here for the following):</p>

					<p><b>Practice:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Undertaking the training rules which encompass ethical culture, serenity and wisdom, and having developed them as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ethical Culture In Full<br />
					Cultivation of serenity Partial<br />
					Cultivation of wisdom Partial</p>

					<p class="f4">Breaking the three yokes</p>

					<p class="f4">By additionally weakening lust, hate and stupidity <i>[rāga-dosa-moha]</i> he becomes</p>

					<p><b>Result:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">The "One-seeder". He takes rebirth as man once; he is a 'Once-returner' Returning once to this world he brings and end to Pain.</p>

							<p class="in2">Note: Again here the wording on this leaves open the possibility that between death in this world and the next return to this world there may be rebirths in other realms. This does not say: 'Taking rebirth only one more time.' In fact, if the Once-returner is to be seen as one who is less advanced than the lowest non-returner, (and that is always the implication) some intervening life or lives must be assumed or this would be a case of a Non-returner returning to this world to make an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 7:</p>

					<p><b>Practice:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Undertaking the training rules which encompass ethical culture, serenity and wisdom, and having developed them as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ethical Culture In Full<br />
					Cultivation of serenity Partial<br />
					Cultivation of wisdom Partial</p>

					<p><b>Result:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Rebirth in two or three good families.</p>

					      <p class="in2">Note that except for the fact that human birth involves much more pain and struggle, and so imply increased effort for attainment of Final <i>Nibbāna,</i> the amount of time for this type of Streamwinner would be less than that for the swiftest non-returner. Or is it the case here as with the Once-returner, that there are intervening lives in other worlds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Type 8:</p>

					<p><b>Practice:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Undertaking the training rules which encompass ethical culture, serenity and wisdom, and having developed them as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ethical Culture In Full<br />
					Cultivation of serenity Partial<br />
					Cultivation of wisdom Partial</p>

					<p><b>Result:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Streamwinning: Rebirth in Hell, as a daemon, ghost or animal is precluded;<br />
					awakening is certain.<br />
					Seven rebirths at most, going up and down among gods and men.</p>

					      <p class="in2">The effort here has only been to make the progression rational and consistent with the various ways this progression is mentioned throughout the suttas. There is no question that it is a matter of interest, but the safest course, if one does not see that one is a Streamwinner, is to aim at that. It is at that point at least that there is certainty without need of 'belief' and perception that one is safe from rebirth in the sorts of lives lower than human status.</p>

After the Buddha departs he has second thoughts and suffers regret mightily. He quickly goes to the Buddha to reveal his error. The revelation is acknowledged and he is given a teaching explaining the importance of being a good example. As well as being the teaching on being a good example, this is a good example of what is meant by 'confession' or 'apology' in the Buddha's system. It is really neither a confession nor an apology, but the making conscious of an error in the presence of a person of such a nature as will make the insident unforgettable and useful as a means for keeping check on one's future behavior. The 'revelation' is made either to the person to whom one has behaved badly or to some highly respected person. This is not easy to do but is powerful medicine! Take a person who habitually lies but who understands the danger in lying. The habit is hard to break when attacked head-on, but if such a one resolves to immediately 'confess' that what he has just said is a lie, the embarassment caused by that will quickly drive him to become more aware when he is speaking.<br />

In the same way that these three tasks are under the control of the farmer, the training is under the control of the <i>bhikkhu;</i> in the same way as the growth of the crop is out of the hands of the farmer; the time of attaining the goal is out of the hands of the <i>bhikkhu.</i> Nevertheless there is expecation of results in both cases.

					Linked to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.092.pali.bd.htm"><i>Pāḷi.</i></a> The Buddha compares the practice of living in solitude of those of other views with the practice of living in solitude of those who follow this <i>Dhamma</i> and Discipline. Then he compares the results of this practice with the steps the farmer goes through to harvest and secure his crop. This sutta describes a course to non-returning based on the practice of seclusion and having cultivated the first <i>jhāna</i> wherein the first three <i>saṇyojana</i> are broken and further there is a restraining of <i>abhijjhāya</i> and <i>vyāpādena</i> (Woodward's coveting and malevolance). Note that the usual fourth <i>saṇyojana</i> is, <i>kāma-c-chanda</i> so that what may be being said is that the restraint of coveting is the essential aspect of wishing for sense pleasures that must at least restrained to attain non-returning.<br />
					The BJT and CSCD pali and Bhk. Bodhi break this sutta into two at section 4. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has this section include all four <i>Jhānas;</i> the CSCD and the <i>Pāḷi</i> apparently followed by Bhk. Bodhi have, as is the case with the PTS <i>Pāḷi,</i> only the first <i>Jhāna.</i> Except for following what was done before, there is no sense to breaking the sutta into two at this point.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi notes that the commentary wants to deny that this is a non-returner, but all the commentary does is invent the name '<i>jhāna</i>-non-returner' and define this in the same way as the non-returner is defined which is just what the sutta does. The essential thing the commentary wants to inject into the thinking about this is that this non-returner does not enter a Brahmā-loka or the Pure Abodes, but goes to some <i>kāma-</i>world (that would include the Tusita realm) and attains Final <i>Nibbāna</i> there. There is nothing in the sutta itself to confirm or deny this, but attainment of the <i>Brahmā Lokas</i> is said to be done by way of attaining the first <i>jhāna</i> even for commoners. Add this to the picture of the non-returner in the outline above. This is a good example of the kind of mess you can get into trusting the commentaries to explain things.</p>

					tathā tathāssa vipākaṃ paṭisaṇvediyatī' ti.</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is such as is the sensation this person intends to create by his deed,<br />
					such as such as that results in the sensation that returns to him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such being the case, beggars,<br />
					there is had the living the godly life<br />
					occasioning thorough understanding of the consummate making of an end to pain."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Kamma</i> is not a matter of 'an eye for an eye'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meaning is that if it were the case that one doing an intentional deed of body, speech or mind necessarily were to experience the consequences in the form of experiences of body, speech and mind (it is not even necessary in this case to specify that these results be identical to those deeds, but only that they are of the same form), the nature of that manner of consequence is such as to preclude escape from <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This must be understood in connection with the statement that there is no doing of an intentional deed without the experience of the consequences thereof. [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.208.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.208</a>]</p>

					<p class="f4">Those two ideas together would require, for example, a deed done with body to be experienced by a consequence to the body, and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">This would require identification with, or being downbound to body. And further, since there is no knowing the extent into the past of our intentional deeds of body, and <i>kamma</i> is not a one-for-one thing, but greatly amplifies whatever deed is done, there could be no knowing or saying that 'after such and such a time of doing no more intentional deeds of body, speech or mind, there will be an end of <i>kamma</i>'. And since the time involved in experiences of this sort is extensive, even if one were to practice very earnestly, death would intervene, and there would follow forgetfulness and in the next rebirth there would be the doing of new deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, if the experience of the repercussion of an intentional deed is in accordance with the sensation to be experienced through the senses that it was intended to cause, (may so-and-so suffer pain, may I enjoy pleasure by way of this deed) then understanding that there are but the three sense-experiences, and that one or another, and only one or another of these experiences accompany all sense experience at whatever level, this allows the results of deeds intended to cause experiences of a certain sort to manifest in connection with any experience through the senses at any level. Then, understanding that sense-experience is limited to the sense-spheres, by so developing one's bodily behavior, heart, and wisdom such as to abandon and rise above sense-experience, there is escape from <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The repercussion of past deeds in the form of sense-experience will follow one up into ever more refined states, but by that very process such perspective is created as encompasses the ultimate past in terms of repercussions in the form of sense-experience (the perspective above sense-experience is the perspective of the totality of existence) and thus is had the experience of the totality of one's past <i>kamma</i> and by this the opportunity is created for the understanding of the consummate making of an end to pain in the understanding that that which is a sense experience is a thing that has come to be and that which has come to be comes to an end, and that by creating no new <i>kamma</i> and by abandoning and rising up above sense experience, <i>kamma</i> is brought to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">The theory one has about the nature of the mechanism of action of <i>kamma</i> will determine the nature of the measures one takes to bring <i>kamma</i> to an end. Holding the first of the two points of view above, one will not be able to bring <i>kamma</i> to an end because one will be attempting to bring the wrong things (forms of behavior resulting in things and events (the belief in the effacacy of ethics, rites and rituals to bring about the end of <i>kamma,</i>  a yoke to rebirth to be broken by the Streamwinner)) to an end. Looking to the second of these points of view one will be able to bring <i>kamma</i> to and end because one will be looking to bring the cause of the experience of sensation through the senses to an end, that is, identification with the intent to create personal sense-experience.</p>

					The Buddha says to 'break the bridge' that leads to singing and dancing. The meaning is that singing and dancing and laughter are reactions to sense stimulus. They are the making of new <i>kamma.</i> There is the sense stimulus and then there follows after an expression which is a statement about that sense stimulus. For the Arahant if what is perceived is worthy, a response is called for, not a reaction. This is what is going on in back of several cases we encounter in the suttas where the Buddha smiles and Ānanda understands this to be significant and worthy of inquiry as to its cause.

Bodhi here "fail", Woodward (in this sutta) 'Warped' and 'askew' with a footnote explaining.' I suggest what we have here in this sutta is the basic intended meaning as it would be understood throughout the world wherever there is construction using wood, that is as Woodward has it, for English, "warped". I suggest the derivation is: via <i>a-pada;</i> via the not-path. For the behavior and mental state: deviance, for the opposite: not-warped or straight or just as good "warped" and "not-warped" for all cases. In terms of the <i>saṇyojanas,</i> this would mean behavior and thinking that deviated from the <i>Magga</i> ... not just malevolance.<br />

					Three things from which originate actions that end <i>kamma</i> for the individual. This is the reverse case of the previous. This pairing of opposites is a frequent practice in the suttas precisely for situations like this where an exact understanding of the terms must be had to put them in both positive and negative form or they turn the sutta into a mess. Woodward notes that here <i>'Nidana'</i> as 'cause' doesn't work but he uses 'cause'. Bhk. Bodhi also uses 'cause'. Its an ego thing. A reflection of <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's problem.</a> The arrogance of the ego that at heart thinks it is God the Creator of the Created: the cause of all this. It's inconceivable that things arise without being 'caused'. How come? "Because I can see that I exist, and I can see that things arise in the world as I become conscious of them and therefore I am the cause of things arising in the world." But: "This being, that becomes," is not a causual relationship, it's an associative relationship. The beginning of both this and the previous sutta is: "There are these three <i>nidana</i> giving rise to <i>kamma,</i>" Here the three are not-lust, etc. Using 'cause' we are saying that a not-thing is the cause of an action. If we understand <i>Nidana </i>to mean, 'bound up in, tied to, (rises in association with)' we then have a sensible translation: Lust is tied to (even based on, even dependent on) the origination of <i>kamma.</i> Not-lust is tied to the origination of <i>kamma.</i> Any <i>kamma</i> tied to lust is no good, any deed not tied to lust is good. In the second case the <i>kamma</i> is the intentional not-doing of any action based on lust. <i>Kamma</i> which ends <i><i>kamma.</i></i><br />

The Buddha describes how desire for things in the past, future and present provide three bases for the arising of <i>kamma.</i> One sort of <i>kamma</i> brings a bad result, the other a good result. Note here the order 'past, future present.' This is the standard throughout the suttas, which I say is the case because the mind is a suggestable, ever evolving thing which is by this order pointed into the past, pointed into the future, but made to land in the present. The order used here [USA] today [Monday, March 10, 2014 6:02 AM]; 'past, present, future', shows a mechanical, hierarchical thinking which has the effect of causing the whole population to focus mindlessly on the future, neither learning from the past nor paying attention to (or even enjoying) the present. Get the education to get the job to get the money to get the things that will show everyone else that one is more future oriented than everyone else. Fast tracking, trend setting, fad followers. The latest hairstyle, skirt-length, shoe, college, industry, location, number of children, ... house, car, telephone, radio, tv, hi-fi, walkman, computer. Faster and faster. Faster, smaller, cheaper ... better? Nobody sees they are out of date before they start, they die hoping to leap-frog the next generation. Like sheep they go to the slaughter. They never looked back to see that in the end they have done nothing, what they got comes to nothing. Round and round and round and round, they drive themselves into the ground. Both Woodward and the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> make errors not keeping this ordering in mind.<br />

Holding the position that the result of understanding all three is the same is thinking that understanding sense desires includes understanding as well forms and sense-experiences (that is, that the same desire to experience a sensation from a given sense organ and sense object will always produce the same sense-experience). By aserting this position he is also claiming to understand the three. But if Bharaṇḍu had understood the <i>relative</i> relationship of sense desire, form, and sense-experience, he would have seen what Gotama was doing (which was showing him that the same sense desire and form combination was producing different sense experiences at each repetition) and he would have seen the error in his thinking and in spite of his embarassment, would not have felt anger (at the unpleasant mind sense-experience of being contradicted), could have seen the value of the lesson (that any sense desire/form situation could give rise to three different sorts of sense-experience depending on one's point of view) and could have become a disciple of Gotama.<br />
					This entire course of events looks like it was forseen by Gotama, but still he had to give Bharaṇḍu the opportunity to take another path. He didn't say in the beginning: "Set me up with lodgings at the ashram of Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman. He could not have remained silent after Bharaṇḍu's interjection or that would have misled Mahānāma. He let fate take its course and played out his part as was required by the situation. The fault was really Bharaṇḍu the Kālāman's for putting himself between Gotama and Mahānāma.<br />

					Linked to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.140.pali.bd.htm"><i>Pāḷi.</i></a> Three sets of three things that indicate one has attained the goal. The three sets are:<br />
					1. having the body of ethical practices of the adept;<br />
					2. having the body of serenity (<i>samādhi</i>) of the adept;<br />
					3. having the body of wisdom of the adept. I do not recall this being defined, but it would likely consist of knowledge of the <i>paṭicca-samuppāda,</i> insight into its implications, knowing the right time to act, and having the skills to act with effect;<br />
					1. having <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#The4PowerPaths">the marvel of magic powers</a>;<br />
					2. having the marvel of <i>ādesanā</i> which PED, Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translate 'mind-reading', but which is literally 'to-discourse'. There is a real marvel in the occurance in one of a spontaneous discourse on the <i>Dhamma</i> and this may be the real meaning. There are two sorts of mind-reading found in the Suttas. One is the reading by knowledge of one's own heart, the hearts of others [see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.22.pali.bd.htm#p12">DN 22 § 12</a>], and the other is knowing by some sign or just by intuitively knowing the train of thought of another. Since thought-reading is essentially 'hearing' the thinking (the <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara,</i> or word-thoughts) of another said to be possible on attaining the second <i>jhāna,</i> so the meaning could be 'to hear the discursive thinking' of another;<br />
					3. the marvel of giving efficatious advice, which Woodward translates 'teaching' and Bhk. Bodhi translates 'instruction' but which is more than just teaching (standing in front of a 'class' and muttering recollected words presumed to be knowledge), it is the ability to know what needs to be taught and having the skills to effectively teach it to a specific audience to bring about advancement towards an intended goal,<br />
					1. having high view. In this book of the suttas understanding this is complicated by the fact that this term is not, as it is elsewhere, defined as the Four truths. See <a href="#view">discussion</a> below for this.<br />
					2. having high knowledge, (seeing the <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_2.htm#DOWNBOUND_CONFOUNDED_ETC"><i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i></a> as it really is)<br />
					3. having attained high liberation (having attained freedom from the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas,</i></a> seeing freedom as freedom, knowing one is free, that rebirth has been ended, one's duty has been done, one has lived the godly life, and that there is no more being some kind of an 'it' at any place of being 'at').<br />
					This is not a list of nine things, it is three lists of three things, each list being a different way of saying the same thing, so by comparing each set with the others to be sure the meanings in it are encompassed by each of the other sets one will arrive at a clearer definition of the meanings of each of the terms. This sutta is divided into three suttas by Bhk. Bodhi and CSCD. Since the usual number of suttas is met by having one sutta here, it looks likely that the original was the first set of three and that the second two sets were added after. This does not make them 'not-<i>Dhamma</i>'. My say.<br />

The title of this sutta in the <i>Pāḷi</i> is <i>'Akusala'.</i> This term is most frequently translated 'unskillful'. 'Sin'; to commit an offense against (God or Law), is not really a Buddhist concept; actions have consequences in accordance with the intent of the actor and the same act can produce various consequences so the idea is really skill at recognizing the intent with which an action is being taken and judging that the consequences will be in accord with that intent and taking the appropriate, or skillful, course. Bhk Bodhi translates as 'Unwholesome.' The synonym is 'unwise.' The term for the converse is <i>'Kusala'</i> which Woodward translates as 'Righteous' which suffers from the same bias and unrelatedness to the <i>Pāḷi</i> as his 'sinful'.<br />
					Woodward footnotes <i>Yathābhataṃ,</i> his 'according to his deserts' and Bhk. Bodhi's 'as if brought there' The whole phrase is <i>yathābhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye/saggeti. yatha</i> = like, as, according to; <i>bhata</i> = support; <i>nikkhitta</i> = laid down; 'thus laid down according to support.' The image is of one who is falling (having been 'cast' by his acts) through space and finds a landing place that supports him. So: "Having these three sorts of behavior he is thus placed in ~ such being in accordance with his support.<br />

The consequences of one's acts are not in accordance with the will of another but follow on their intent to cause pleasant or unpleasant or not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant experiences. Not all things held to be blameworthy are faulty and not all things held to be blameless are faultless. Blame is a moral judgment and morality derives its authority not from a view-based standard of ethical behavior but on popular opinion. One 'fears blame', as a practical matter but trying to determine what is and what is not an act that will further one's progress towards the goal of the <i>Dhamma</i> using 'blame' as a standard is risky.<br />

It is included here as one sutta, showing section breaks but without repeating the first part of each sutta for the sake of maintaining the PTS sutta numbering system intact. In understanding the sutta however the best course would be to read it as separate suttas. That would mean that the middle way that avoides hedonistic self-indulgence and self-torture would be being <i>variously</i> defined as:
					1. (in the previous sutta) as the four settings-up of memory [<i>saṭipaṭṭhānas,</i> not so named],<br />
					2. the four best efforts [<i>padhānāni,</i> not so named],<br />
					3. the four paths to magic powers <i>[iddi-pāda],</i><br />
					4. the the controlling forces <i>[indriya],</i><br />
					5. the controlling powers <i>[bala],</i><br />
					6. the seven dimensions of self-awakening, <i>[sambojjhaṅga],</i><br />
					7. the eight-fold path (not so named).<br />
					As for the interesting questions this raises ... well:<br />
					Was this the original understanding of the Middle Way, or a later construction. Assuming this was a later construction, when reading the first sutta one must ask how it was so effective when it did not define the terms in the Way, nor did it define the Four Truths as <i>'Sammā Diṭṭhi'.</i><br />
					This is the group of <i>'Dhammas'</i> that is understood to be the <i>'Dhamma'</i> which is to be set up and remembered as 'living in the <i>Dhamma</i> observing the <i>Dhamma',</i> aka the fourth <i>satipaṭṭhana.</i> This could explain the apparent confusion in the collections which I would put back in order this way: Both 151 and 152+ are one sutta. The statement is that the Middle way is: The Four <i>satipaṭṭhanas.</i> The Fourth <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> is then further defined ("And what, beggars, is living in the <i>Dhamma,</i> overseeing the <i>Dhamma</i>? Herein a beggar ..." remembers to develop items 2-7. ... but in this case, how was <i>'Sammā Diṭṭhi'</i> defined, and if as usual in this book, where are the Four Truths?<br />
					This is all just fun speculation, there needs to be no doubt as to doctrine as with some effort it can be shown that each of these seven <i>Dhammas</i> are equal to each of the others. The Buddha once said that if four wise men were to sit down to question him in turn taking breaks only for food, sleep and the calls of nature, they would all be dead and gone before he had come to the end of the possible ways the four <i>satipaṭṭhanas</i> could be constructed. (I wrote this just as I was beginning to format and proof <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.012.horn.pts.htm#fn89">MN 12</a> where this statement is made.)<br />

					[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p79">MN 79</a>] <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.079.horn.pts.htm">Lesser Discourse to Sakuludāyin</a> Horner translation.<br />
					Linked to the fully rolled-out <i>Pāḷi</i> and the Sister Upalavana translation. It is recommended that this sutta and the next be read together. Ms. Horner has messed up in this translation a few of the most essential points, and better solutions have been noted. It is worth taking the time here to outline the events in this very long sutta so that they may be better carried in mind when reading the follow-up in the next sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin is visited by Gotama. He first asks for an explanation as to why Nātaputta the Jain faultered when asked a question. Gotama answers with the statement that those who know and see the past and the future would not falter and then he teaches Udāyin the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> in brief:</p>

					<p class="f4">If this is,<br />
					that comes to be;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises;<br />
					if this is not,<br />
					that does not come to be;<br />
					from the stopping of this,<br />
					that is stopped.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not understood by Sakuludāyin, who states that he would be better able to discuss a teaching of his own teachers, namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the highest lustre,<br />
					this is the highest lustre.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama points out that this does not reveal much, and when Sakuludāyin, does finally get around to explaining what 'this' is, he does so with a simile.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama then in a towering series of comparisons forces Sakuludāyin, to realize that he has, as well as having said that this 'this' he is speaking of has less lustre than a glow worm, has still not actually pointed out what that 'this' is. And Sakuludāyin, admits to being completely defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again when questioned about another doctrine of his teachers' — that of a world exclusively pleasureable and a path for attaining that world — his teacher's doctrine is shown to be incapable of realizing that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, shown the real path to that world, and asking if this is the goal for which people follow him, Gotama explains the real goal for which people follow him. A condition beyond sense pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is interesting to note here that Sakuludāyin's followers raise a ruckus at the point where this path is given. This path consists of the first three of the four <i>jhānas,</i> and Sakuludāyin's followers say that they do not have any experience of anything <i>beyond</i> this. Since what is being spoken of is their ancient tradition, the implication is that at least these three <i>jhānas</i> were known prior to the Buddha's enlightenment. But apparently the commentary goes even further and suggests that at one time the attainment of this world (which is via the fourth <i>jhāna</i>) was once known by this group but had been forgotten. So all four <i>jhānas</i> were apparently known before Gotama. One wonders then what it was that was special about the use of <i>jhāna</i> by Gotama that lead him to awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sakuludāyin, is convinced, but is disuaded from entering the order by his followers.</p>

					<p class="f4">[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p80">MN 80</a>] <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.080.horn.pts.htm">Discourse to Vekhanassa</a> Horner translation.<br />
					Linked to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and Sister Upalavana translation.<br />
					The wanderer Vekhanassa, teacher of Sakuludāyin, has come to challenge Gotama but is shown to be holding a viewpoint based entirely on hearsay ("This is the highest lustre...") which breaks down under close questioning. He is then led to acceptance of the more realistic doctrine of the Buddha.<br />
					What is it that by the end has convinced Vekhanassa that he is holding on to a belief which he himself does not see for himself? What convinces him that Gotama knows a saving <i>dhamma?</i> Challenged by way of a simile, Gotama, using similes, releases Vekhanassa from 'sutta-bondage' (a key use of word-play missed by Ms. Horner). The whole dynamic goes on beyond anything actually stated in the sutta and without 'seeing' what Gotama does or how it is working on Vekhanassa's mind, it makes no sense. This is a exquisite example of the magic of a sutta.<br />
					[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p81">MN 81</a>] <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.081.horn.pts.htm">Discourse on Ghaṭīkāra</a> Horner translation.<br />
					Linked to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.081.pali.bd.htm"><i>Pāḷi</i></a> and <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/mnl/mn/mn.081.upal.mnl.htm">Sister Upalavana translation.</a> This is one of a few cases in which a story of one of Gotama's previous births is recorded in a sutta. The Buddha's wandering brings him to a spot where the Buddha Kassapa once taught and where at that time in a previous birth as Jotipāla, Gotama had to be dragged by the hair to visit this Buddha and hear his <i>Dhamma.</i> He immediately joined the order. This sutta is a great story told in the manner of the story-tellers of old. Then there is the issue raised by the report in this sutta that in this previous birth Gotama had joined the order of a previous Buddha. The issue is that Buddhas are supposed to attain awakening without the aid of another Buddha. The issue is not whether or not it is 'allowed' for him to join another Buddha's order in the process of evolution to becoming a Buddha, the issue is having got another Buddhas understanding to such a degree as to establish stream-entry. Once stream entry is established Awakening is assured and as such one has become a disciple of the Buddha from whose teaching this experience arose and one may no longer lay claim to being a <i>samma-sambuddha.</i> So there is a big debate based on pure speculation as to what Gotama did or did not accomplish under Buddha Kassapa. The debate in its formal dress (Points of Controversay IV.8) is being put up here to give a taste of old-time debates. The translators' have also attached an appendix dealing with their term for the point at which one has crossed the line or is on a fixed course to (assured of) Arahantship. That is also attached here. The issue bears on the Mahayana position with regard to the Budhisattva. The Mahayana bodhisatva is supposed to stop short of Awakening and wait until all beings attain Awakening together. But short of stream-entry there is no assurance of attaining awakening, and nobody could assure anybody that they would attain awakening eventually if they put it off. Conversely, Stream-entry is not just 'assurance' it is being set on a course which inevitably and within a finite period leads upward (there is no being born in a lower state than the one one is now in) and on to Arahantship, Awakening. The conclusion is that those who are teachers in the Mahayana schools who teach postponing Awakening are not Streamwinners and consequently do not have a clue as to what they are saying. This is understandable. They have an excess of compassion. But it is not a <i>Dhamma</i> that leads to awakening or can give assurance that one will not be reborn in lower states.<br />
					This is an excellent example of the sort of debate to avoid. A fruitless spinning of the wheels over a meaningless issue. It does not lead one forward on the path. A complete waste of time. Getting involved with this sort of thing is the hazzard of approaching one's <i>dhamma vicaya</i> from the commentaries first rather than from the original suttas. One could think this was an important issue being debated by learned arahants.<br />

					The Buddha compares the reasons for the success or failure of a shopkeeper to the reasons for the success or failure of a <i>bhikkhu's</i> attainment of serenity.<br />
					Good advice for businessmen — get down to business! — and good advice for those practicing <i>samadhi.</i><br />
					The advice for <i>bhikkhus</i> turns on the understanding of the phrase: <i>sakkaccaṃ samādhi-nimittaṃ adhi-ṭ-ṭhāti:</i> <i>"sincerely bear down on the sign or mark of serenity"</i>.<br />
					Woodward: "concentrate on the mark of his meditation exercise"; and Bhk. Bodhi: "dilligently apply himself to an object of concentration".<br />
					Putting aside the confusion we have here over what is being translated 'concentration' [Woodward: <i>adhi-ṭ-ṭhāti;</i> Bhk. Bodhi: <i>samādhi</i>], in this case this <i>'nimitta'</i> has nothing to do with either a 'mark of meditation exercise' or 'an object of concentration' (where in both cases the translators understand the meaning of <i>nimitta</i> to be the 'reflex-image' of a concentration device).<br />
					The word '<i>samādhi-nimittaṃ</i>' [PED has: 2. Description and characterization of <i>samādhi:</i> Its four nimittas or signs are the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">M I.301</a>] is a compound, which following Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi's understanding would necessitate the translaltion: '<i>samadhi</i>-reflex image', or 'meditation-reflex image', or 'concentration-reflex image' meaning some sort of reflex image of the state one is attempting to achieve which would require it to be had before the thing being done to acquire it.<br />
					The term 'reflex-image' is used by the translators of the commentary. I don't know what <i>Pāḷi</i> word is being so translated or the precise description of the process being recommended, but the risk is that this will be understood as some sort of 'after-image' — something like when concentrating on a red splotch one looks up and sees a green splotch. As that term is being translated and explained it means the <i>image</i> of the <i>kasina</i> or concentration device or object useful for establishing concentration, calm or serenity or detachment; that is, the image itself, and the object <i>is</i> to get, cultivate and maintain this image 'in the mind's eye.'<br />
					That is not what is being looked for in <i>this</i> situation. The idea here is 'sign' or 'indication' <i>of</i> <i>samādhi</i> (serenity). Something indicating the way access to serenity has been previously attained or to be watched for if it has not been previously attained.<br />
					The thing to be looked for here is the state of having been <i>absorbed directly</i> (fascinated, interested ... don't get hung up on the term!, its the 'directly' part that's important — without the usual intervening awareness of awareness) in following the breathing, a thought (<i>vitakka</i> or <i>vicara</i>) or in some day-dream-like image, a clear mental picture of something one is working on, planning etc. or of a concentration device <i>(kassina),</i> ... and it is not the object (the image or the thought) that is the sign to be noticed, it is the <i>direct absorbtion,</i> the viewing of the object or situation or observing of the train of thought without self-conscousness (self-awareness, an intervening awareness of awareness) that is the <i>nimitta,</i> the <i>sign</i> or <i>indication</i> of the onset of serenity.<br />
					At first becoming aware of this sign will interrupt the processs. That is why one should review the stages after one's practice. This is <i>yoniso-mani-sikaro:</i> (studious etiological examination) trace out in your mind the features of the point of onset, what factors contribute to the maintenance of the serene state, and what brings it to an end. Over time (the practice is to go back and forth between self-conscious observance of the image and the absorbed state: being absorbed, loosing the absorbed state, bringing the mind back to the image) one will loose self consciousness and allow progress. That is achieved by not hanging on to the object and allowing the process to unfold on its own.<br />
					Part of one's careful planning here is to remember to include a command (a mental program) to emerge from this direct absorption: "Let me emerge from this absorption by becoming aware of self-awareness and worldly objects [at such-and-such a time, or after so long, or upon such and such an event, <i>i.e.,</i> nightfall, dawn.]" Without taking the precaution of an exit strategy one is highly likely to experience only flashes of the experience of <i>samādhi,</i> or not to enter it in the first place.<br />

Three elders differ on which is the best of three forms of Stream-entry and submit the question to the Buddha. There is no definate answer as to the form, individuals are more or less advanced in accordance with the next stage of progress (once returning, non-returning, arahantship) at which they are aimed.<br />
					This sutta is helpful in clarifying the fact that the terms <i>kāya-sakkhī,</i> (seer in body; Woodward: testifying with body, aka: body-knower; Bhk. Bodhi: body witness); <i>diṭṭha-p-patto,</i> (attained to view); <i>saddhā-vimutto</i> (freed by faith); all refer to Stream-winners.<br />
					Then, the three designations are themselves helpful in clarifying the distinctive features of various sorts of Stream-winning. The one that is a body-seer has experienced temporary freedom from sense-experience, does not rely on faith, but may not have a strong intellectual understanding of what has happened other than that it is the goal. The one who has attained view, is one who has penetrated by insight into the truth of the idea that all things that have come to be are destined to come to an end, does not rely on faith, but he may not have any experience of liberation from body; the one freed by faith has confidence in his liberation, but may have no experience of freedom from body, or any deep insight into the four truths.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi footnotes and explains the differences: "For formal explanations of these three types, see <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p70"><i>MN</i> 70.</a>17-19, <i>I</i> 478,<sup>4</sup>-479,<sup>3</sup>. ... As general classes, they differ, not in their position relative to the final goal, but in their dominant spiritual faculty. The body witness <i>kāya-sakkhī,</i> gives prominence to concentration and attains the "peaceful formless emancipations." One attained to view <i>diṭṭha-p-patto,</i> gives prominience to wisdom and does not attain the formless emancipations. One liberated by faith <i>saddhā-vimutto</i> gives prominence to faith and does not attain the formless emancipations."<br />
					It would be better to say of these not that they 'do not attain' but that they 'may not have attained'; in fact they may have attained some experience of each. Note here also the fact that is not always clear (especially when <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimokkha.htm"><i>vimokkha,</i></a> 'release', is translated as 'emancipation' (the slave may be temporarily released from chains but not yet be freed) (in AN 4.189 he translates it as 'release') that the 'peaceful formless releases' are not the same thing as <i>Nibbāna</i> or the goal and are temporary states.<br />

					Providing medical treatment to three types of persons is likened to teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to three types of persons. One sort of person will not recover whether he receives treatment or not; one will recover whether he receives treatment or not; and one will recover if he receives treatment, but not if he does not. Similarly one sort of person will not gain the path whether he hears <i>Dhamma</i> or not; one will gain the path whether he hears <i>Dhamma</i> or not; and one will gain the path if he hears <i>Dhamma</i> and not if he does not. It is for the sake of the sick man who will recover if he receives medical treatment that providing medical treatment for the sick is not useless.

It happens frequently. The hypothesis is that it was a sort of game played by Gotama, possibly also by the questioner. Could the listener figure out that the two different responses were equivalants (or would he think Gotama was inconsistent?); could Gotama remember his previous response; could he come up with a variation that was an equivalant to the previous answer; how was it equivalent. Whether this hypothesis is correct or not it makes a good exercise in ones comprehension to try to see the equivalence.<br />

If you can get passed the doubt injected by the theory that these repetitions were invented by the early editors and 'could never have been uttered by Gotama', and can get over the bored reaction to them, you can see here a great game going on. How does Mahā Kaccana know that this time this set of explanations is to be used rather than the previous set? The Arahant is sitting around waiting for his time to be up, he has no interest in worldly activities to fill the time remaining, he is 'living in the <i>Dhamma</i>'. These games serve to teach others, preserve the <i>Dhamma,</i> and provide a pleasant, even challenging pastime.<br />

The explanation is that such gifts are of benefit only to those reborn in the realm of <i>petas</i> (the so-called 'hungry ghosts'). Asked again who would benefit if no relative were reborn there Gotama replies that it is impossible that no relative would be reborn there, but that in any case there is benefit to the giver and he enumerates a number of cases.

					Ten attributes defining the low road and ten defining the high road. A very interesting thing arises here in that in this chapter the set of attributes is being called the <i>'ariya magga.'</i> While this is not the <i>'Ariya Atthangika Magga'</i> as we know it, it is however the way that the <i>'Ariya Atthangika Magga'</i> is often analyzed, that is, into the categories body, speech and mind.<br />

					The Buddha contrasts twelve pairs of persons in accordance to whether they are following the low path or the high path. This sutta is counted as twelve suttas in Be and Ce which is followed by Bhk. Bodhi; the BJT (apparently a version of Ce expanded and edited to closely follow the PTS) has this as one sutta with 12 divisions; the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> (Ee) numbers this as one sutta to be expanded as here. It is possible this represents an early form of abridgment. It is also possible, if the sutta began with the full list of what was to be taught (<i>e.g.,</i> the Ariyan and unariyan, the bright way and the dark way, true <i>dhamma</i> and false <i>dhamma</i> ...) that it was, and by implication the other suttas of this sort were, originally single suttas.<br />

					Ten things resulting in one being reborn in Hell, ten resulting in one being reborn in a pleasant or heavenly birth. 'Purgatory' is Woodward's suggested translation for <i>Niraye,</i> Hell, in accordance with a precise understanding of the Judeo-Christian concept where 'Hell' proper is eternal and Purgatory temporary. Since <i>Niraye</i> is a temporary condition, was the thinking, this could not qualify it to be called Hell. The Buddhist position, is that there is no state of existence which is eternal. The common understanding of the idea of Hell today will do for life in <i>Niraye,</i> which can last to the end of a world cycle.<br />

						<div class="inner">

							<p class="f3">Something that might be of interest to those researching the development of the <i>Dhamma</i> is the use in the past few dozen suttas of the term <i>'sammā diṭṭhi'</i> (consummate view, <a id="view">high view,</a> 'right' view) as defined in a way that is not the equivalent of the four truths (as <i>'sammā diṭṭhi'</i> is defined, for example, in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm#p21">DN 22</a>).<br />
							It is the converse of this definition of the term which is implied most frequently when speaking of those of low view (<i>miccha diṭṭhi</i> (as above)). Use of this definition when speaking of non-believers is essential for the sake of reason in that prior to Gotama the four truths were unknown and had the criteria for higher births been knowing that, there would be no higher births outside the Buddha's <i>Dhamma</i> or in periods between Buddhas where the <i>Dhamma</i> is all but non-existent, something we are led to believe is not the case.<br />
							There is a problem here when it comes to understanding the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">first sutta</a> (as we have it) where <i>sammā diṭṭhi</i> is not defined. The four truths are given, but it is not stated that this is to be the definition of <i>sammā diṭṭhi.</i> If the definition of <i>sammā diṭṭhi</i> was originally as we have it in these suttas it would be this definition that would be heard by the first five disciples, and that would imply that the <i>Magga</i> was to be understood as separate from the four truths. It could have then been added into the <i>Magga</i> in the form of <i>sammā ñāṇa,</i> the ninth dimension, when the <i>Magga</i> is given with ten dimensions where it is known as the <i>Asekha Pada,</i> the path of the non-seeker or simply the <i>Ariya Magga,</i> no eightfold. There what we usually find for its definition is the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> and that is the equivalent of the Four Truths. This would go a long way to explain what was seen as the need for a change of terms in the <i>Pāḷi</i> for the ninth dimension as discussed in <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_2.htm#SAMMAVIJJA">The <i>Pāḷi</i> Line.</a> That is, if the original ten part path began with <i>sammā diṭṭhi</i> as defined here, then <i>sammā ñāṇa</i> as 'knowledge' or 'book knowledge' would make sense where when <i>sammā diṭṭhi</i> is defined as the four truths, the redundancy does not go well. This would mess up any theory as to the precision of the language of Gotama's awakening, but it would not be unreasonable to think of as an evolution in the formulation of the <i>Dhamma.</i> Alternatively what we would need to assume is that the definition of <i>sammā diṭṭhi</i> as the Four Truths was an error in memory or is an editorial construction. There is nothing in either of these two hypotheses which amounts to a contradiction in doctrine. A sacred cow might have to be slaughtered, but that would be a bloodless sacrifice.</p>
