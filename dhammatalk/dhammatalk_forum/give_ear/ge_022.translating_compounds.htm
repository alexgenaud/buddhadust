					<h1>Translating Compounds</h1>

						<p class="f4"><i>Chanda-Rāga,</i> and other similar compounds are mostly translated 'x and y'. But <i>Pāḷi</i> can be constructed 'x-y' as easily as English, and I suggest that the intent of making these a compound is to have them understood as a compound. Of Course we have the problem that in the original there is no hyphen to make this distinction and all the words are run together. Such destinction  has been made by an modern editor, but presuming that this has been done with a fair degree of accuracy, we need to, at least give it consideration,</p>

						<p class="f4">Here literally (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 3.22.25</a>) 'wish-rage' (rage as in 'its all the rage') 'wish-lust' (the madness of wishing which would emphasize that what was being spoken of was a broad spectrum of wishes more clearly than the two ideas 'wishing' and 'lust' separately) or 'lust-wishing' (wishing for things giving rise to lust); at least 'lustful wishing' or 'wishful lusting'. In cases where we have two persons linked in a compound (Sariputta-Moggallāna) too I suggest that they are, when spoken of this way, to be understood as more closely linked than if separated by the 'and'. Something to be thought of as a single unit. The 'Sariputta-Moggallāna' team. So such compounds were intended to 'unite to emphasize'.</p>

						<p class="f4">I'm not saying 'always' or 'must', but much more frequently that is at present the case.</p>
