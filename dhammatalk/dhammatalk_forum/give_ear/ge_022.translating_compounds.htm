					<h1>Translating Compounds</h1>

						<p class="f4"><i>Chanda-Rāga,</i> and other similar compounds are mostly translated 'x and y'. But Pali can be constructed 'x-y' as easily as English, and I suggest that the intent of making these a compound is to have them understood as a compound. Here literally (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 3.22.25</a>)'wish-rage' (rage as in 'it's all the rage') 'wish-lust' (the madness of wishing which would emphasize that what was being spoken of was a broad spectrum of wishes more clearly than the two ideas 'wishing' and 'lust' separately) or 'lust-wishing' (wishing for things giving rise to lust); at least 'lustful wishing' or 'wishful lusting'. In cases where we have two persons linked in a compound (Sariputta-Moggallāna) too I suggest that they are, when spoken of this way, to be understood as more closely linked than if separated by the 'and'. Something to be thought of as a single unit. The 'Sariputta-Moggallāna' team. So such compounds were intended to 'unite to emphasize'.</p>

						<p class="f4">I'm not saying 'always' or 'must', but much more frequently that is at present the case.</p>
