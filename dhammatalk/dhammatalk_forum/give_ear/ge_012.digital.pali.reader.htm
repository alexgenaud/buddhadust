					Further, there are at least three new similar tools under development. I have no links; keep an eye out!</p>

					<h1>Digital <i>Pāḷi</i> Reader</h1>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Phra Yuttadhammo and Alexander Genaud have developed a very useful tool for translators and <i>Dhamma</i> researchers.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Digital <i>Pāḷi</i> Reader (DPR) is a tool in the form of a Mozilla Firefox extension, much like a hard-copy language reader, facilitating study of the <i>Pāḷi</i> language at an advanced level.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rather than offering a translation for the text being read, a reader usually includes a dictionary with all of the difficult words found in the reader.</p>

					<p class="f4">The DPR differs from an ordinary reader in several respects:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. The DPR allows for instant lookup of words, simply by clicking on a word in the passage being read.  This avoids time spent looking for the word in a hard-copy dictionary or in another place on one's computer.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. The DPR has a built in search function similar to that of the CSCD. Whereas the CSCD allows for only global searches or searches of entire <i>pitakas,</i> the DPR provides <i>Nikaya</i> and Book searches as well.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. The dictionary files in the DPR were not designed specifically for the purpose at hand, and of course word-to-definition matches are sometimes incorrect due to imperfect analysis.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. The DPR includes several dictionaries: <i>Pāḷi</i>-English, English-<i>Pāḷi</i>, <i>Pāḷi</i> proper names, and Concise <i>Pāḷi</i> Dictionary. These dictionaries can be directly accessed from the control panel.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. The DPR has several useful auxiliary utilities, including:</p>

					<p class="f4">a. A bookmark and quote clipboard for keeping important passages<br />
					b. A <i>Pāḷi</i> conversion utility that converts to and from Velthius, Unicode, and other scripts<br />
					c. Random English quotes from Buddhavacana, by S. Dhammika.</p>

					<p class="f4">While the DPR is far from perfect, it is sure to be useful for intermediate <i>Pāḷi</i> students who wish to advance their studies to a higher level.</p>

					<p class="f4">To get started, install both the DPR extension and Myanmar Tipitaka extensions from the sidebar, and optionally the Thai Tipitaka and Sanskrit dictionary extensions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Phra Yuttadhammo's Digital <i>Pāḷi</i> Reader may be downloaded from SourceForge.</p>
