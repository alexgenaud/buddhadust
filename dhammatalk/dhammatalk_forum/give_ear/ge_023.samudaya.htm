					<h1>Samudaya</h1>

						<p class="f4"><i>Samudaya Saŋ + udaya</i> = Own, Self up-and-out. Translated throughout, including PED as 'arise' or 'origin', but which translation does not account for the <i>'saŋ'.</i> In meaning 3 'produce, revenue', I believe we see the intent. It is the 'in-come' or arising to the self of something. Alternatively it could be 'arising as the self' of something. This, along with translating <i>'saŋkhārā'</i> as own-making shakes to it's foundations the existing translations and understanding of what the Buddha taught. The difference in this case is the difference between saying "This is how pain arises." versus "This is how your own personal pain arises." The second is much more likely to inspire engagement.</p>
