					<p class="f4">What does it mean when the Arahant states: "Debt-free <i>(anaṇa)</i> am I!"?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When one comes to a complete halt, stops the world, ends own-making, makes no new kamma whether of mind, speech or body, what remains is only the results of old kamma. Old kamma is the debt. It is debt in the sense that Kamma is energy which, like electricity when it contacts the filiments in a lightbulb produces illumination needs an object to have an effect and is a force in nature out of balance until it is grounded out. The objects of kamma, the filiments, are the subjective mind and the five lower senses. No longer associating with body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or individualized consciousness, the Arahant no longer subjectively experiences the effects of returning kamma. There is no longer a subjective existing being there. His experience of such kamma that remains to be experienced to ground out is as of a detached observer. His effort at having detached himself from subjective existence is his having paid off his debt. This is the meaning of being debt-free.</p>

						<h4 class="ctr">The Idea of Death<br />
						<span class="f4">As a Guide to Forming Priorities</span></h4>					  	
						
						<p class="f4">You only need this one idea: You could die at any time now. In the next couple of years, or in the next year, in the next month, in the next week, tomorrow, in the next minute. You just don't know. The only reasonable way to deal with this is to act with the idea that you could die at any time from the next minute on.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Make Death your constant companion. With that idea taken seriously you can set up life priorities which will be rewarding now in the relief from stress of worry about future regret and will give you at the end the satisfaction of having done your best to meet the challenges of life in a reasoned manner.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Setting priorities is also hugely rewarding in this material world. You accomplish much more and what you accomplish assumes an order which builds on your personal growth.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Do, for yourself, that which you wish to have done or think you ought to have done before you die. Or said another way, do what you would regret not having done before you die.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Deal with all beings as though it were the last time you would be dealing with them ... before they die ... before you die.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Some sub-sets of these might be: broadening and deepening one's knowledge of the Dhamma; training yourself not to deal with people dismissively (or worse); expressing gratitude; paying off debts; righting wrongs done; doing good works.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Setting priorities is a complicated process. One's list of priorities will change over time. Priorities will change in the context of your learning. Some priorities influence other priorities so changes in one set will force changes in another. Be flexible. Do not hang on to a set of priorities just because it has served you well in the past.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">This one consideration, considering the idea of death, will serve well as an over-riding guide for the setting of most lists of priorities.</p>

						<p class="f4">There are those who, declare of a theory of salvation, enlightenment or awakening:</p>

						<p class="f4">These five are unreliable bases for making the declaration:</p>

					The Buddha's wandering brings him to a spot where the Buddha Kassapa once taught and where at that time in a previous birth as Jotipala, Gotama had to be dragged by the hair to visit this Buddha and hear his Dhamma.<br />
					Of course there developed a great controversy over this sutta concerning the idea that a Buddha is 'self-awakened', not brought to awakening by having heard another's doctrine. But there is hearing a doctrine and even professing great belief in it without understanding a word of it or what it was intended to accomplish. Gotama makes the statement that it was under this Buddha (Kassapa Buddha) that he '... lived the higher life for supreme enlightenment in the future.' This can mean no more than that he lived within the rules of a bhikkhu with the intent to attain awakening. It says nothing about having accomplished even the first step of this desire.

					The story of Ratthapala who, inspired by a Dhammatalk given by the Buddha wishes to enter the order but is refused the permission of his parents. He vows to die on the spot unless he receives permission and after many pleadings by his parents and friends finally gets his parents concent. He thereafter quickly becomes arahant. On revisiting his family he is first unrecognized and subjected to abuse, then his father tries to tempt him to return to the world with gold and his former wives. He is not persuaded and delivers a sermon in verses on the subject of the pains in the world. Still later he discourses to the king on four doctrines of the Buddha concerning the futility of living in the world.<br />

One ponders the pleasant feature of another and liking is generated which produces a pleasant sensation and like the feedback that results from placing a microphone too close to the speaker it is connected to, an intense cycle of liking and pleasant sensations results. Alteration in the source of the pleasant sensation results in pain felt at the loss of the pleasure. Always. To the degree of the attachment.

					The Brahmin Brahmayu, at the age of 120, is converted and becomes a non-returner when he sees the 32 marks of a great man in Gotama and is taught a gradual course in Dhamma.<br />
					This sutta has several interesting features. The casual mention of this brahmin as being 120 years old and 'reaching life's termination'! is only one of several such examples of life expectancy at the time. The 32 marks of the Superman are always a good challenge. Try and work out in your mind how these marks can be both physically visible and representative of superiority or special powers in a being. Note the manner of the exchange; that is, in verse. This was a frequent form of debate and required that the one challenged reply to the challenge in the form of the challenge. Verse required a reply in verse, etc. Today such debates are still to be found in Spain and Arab countries and in musical battles in many countries. Also note the extreme politeness and respect in the brahmin's behavior.<br />

					A debate between a brahmin and the Buddha concerning the relative merits of the casts. A thoroughly rational and convincing set of arguments for the position that it is individual merit, not birth that distinguishes one man from another.<br />
					Well, this is not just a debate with good logical points being made. It is withering assault on a stupid idea that twists the argument into a knot and tosses it aside. It is to the credit of Gotama's opponent that he never believed he would win the argument in the first place and that he so gracefully acknowledges defeat in becoming a disciple of the Buddha.<br />
					An interesting point that comes up in passing is the notion of how conception occurs and the role in that of the Gandhabba. The role of the Gandhabba is questioned by some. Here it is clear that the Gandhabba is the spirit of the being to be reborn. This is not some guardian spirit or musical chorus attending the event to make sure of it's success. Further, though there is no mention of this here, or elsewhere that I know of, there is competition for this role in the event. Fierce competition, as with the stream of millions of spermatozoa competing to be the one fertalizing the one egg. Imagine then, on top of the competition between Ghandhabbas seeking rebirth, and the competition between the millions of spermatazoa coming down one individual's ... um ... stream, the competition between beings for the roles as the participating male and female in the picture, and you begin to get some sense of the difficulty of finding rebirth again as a human, once death has overtaken the body.<br />

					The Buddha resolves the dispute between two brahman youths. One held the belief that a brahman was a brahman because of birth, the other that a brahman was a brahman because of deeds. In many examples the Buddha shows that one is a brahman because of deeds.<br />
					This sutta is cut off mid-way because of missing pages in my copy. Links are given to other translations.<br />
					This sutta is hard to swallow as an authentic utterance of the Buddha. The point is within the scope of the Dhamma, the argument over all is reasonable, but the details are carelessly put and subject the whole argument to rebuttal. Gotama is not a careless speaker. For example it is said here that there is no difference in color. (Color is also 'cast', but here it uses as an example the differences in color between animals.) But we see there are differences in color. We can see differences in some of the other characteristics which this sutta claims are not different. The human being can be bread to bring out differences like any other animal and that has happened over time. The idea is that any differences in physical characteristics between human beings resulting from birth are superficial in the sense that they are not taken into consideration in the determination of nobility of character.<br />
					Personally I would put this sutta to one side as being doubtful. It seems probable that it was an elaborated version of some real discussion, but the story-teller got carried away with himself.<br />

					In this sutta the Buddha outlines various views about the nature of the real, essential self and the world, past, future and present and points out that these views are all speculative and that for true satisfaction and liberation one must let go of all that which has been constructed, including speculative opinions.<br />
					This sutta is seriously flawed as we have received it. There is an obvious section missing, it begins in an untypical way, and there is a disjoint between it's stated purpose in the beginning and the way it concludes. It looks like a fragment that has been expanded by the commentator(s) blindly appending an orthodox set of teachings which are nevertheless out of place here. Neither Chalmers nor Horner notice the missing segment. Bhk. Bodhi has it correctly (though he leaves it explained in a doubtful manner by the commentator) but his version of this sutta was not among those released for free distrbution. Put this one aside, or take just the beginning 'summary' and see how the point is understanding how the set of five can be encompassed by the set of three. Here is my version of the opening section:</p>

					Ānanda responds to questions about how the order can maintain harmony without a designated leader.<br />
					Bhikkhu Thanissaro's introduction to this sutta:<br />
					This discourse presents a picture of life in the early Buddhist community shortly after the Buddha's passing away. On the one hand, it shows the relationship between the monastic community and the political powers that be: the monks are polite and courteous to political functionaries, but the existence of this discourse shows that they had no qualms about depicting those functionaries as a little dense. On the other hand, it shows that early Buddhist practice had no room for many practices that developed in later Buddhist traditions, such as appointed lineage holders, elected ecclesiastical heads, or the use of mental defilements as a basis for concentration practice.<br />

					The Buddha discourses on the qualities of the bad man and those of the good man.<br />
					This sutta, as well as describing the bad man and the good man, brings up the interesting idea that it is not possible for a bad man to "know" a bad man or a good man. The idea is that it is not possible for a person to see as a fault in another a fault he himself does not believe is a fault or a virtue he does not think is a virtue. I think this does not mean, for example, that the liar cannot tell another liar. He is just unable to see a fault in telling lies. In other words what he cannot see is not the fault, but the goodness or badness of the qualities. There are those who have faults they understand as faults and I think it does not contradict this sutta when we find that these persons are sometimes able to acknowledge in someone else the goodness that they do not themselves possess. Indeed this is a necessary pre-requisite for undertaking the effort at salvation taught by the Buddha.<br />

					This Sutta describes how Sariputta attained the goal through tracking down the essential factors necessary for insight.<br />
					This is a very interesting and unique sutta as is evidenced by the number of translations we have. In it we find the details of the jhanas described in more than the usual detail, and we have the over-arching method which is: observation of the component parts of a mental state; tracing them back to their point of origin; following them back to their point of ending; drawing the conclusion that these are ending things and do not constitute that which is self or belonging to self; and then separating one's self from them, becoming detached. Probably the most instructive sutta when it comes to developing and using the jhanas to attain detachment.<br />

					The questions that should be put to one who has stated that for him rebirth is left behind, lived is the best of lives, done is duty's doing, there is no more being any sort of an 'it' at any place of 'atness' left for him; i.e., he has declared arahantship.<br />
					Here the Buddha has specifically used this formula for declaring arahantship. This is possibly because the term Arahant was used at the time to designate an honorable (worthy) person other than an arahant. So by using this specific formula the exact meaning of the term in this context is unmistakable.<br />

					The Buddha gives the bhikkhus a course leading to Nibbāna by way of contrasting the attitudes of the good man and the not so good man to each stage of the process.<br />
					Another very important sutta for meditators. At the point in this sutta where he begins describing the pride of a bad man in his accomplishments regarding the <i>jhānas</i>, we find the statement:</p>

							<p class="fp4 in2"><i>'Paṭhamajjhāna- [through to the n'eva-saññā-nāsaññāyatanaɱ] -samāpattiyā pi kho atammayatā vuttā Bhagavatā:</i>|| ||</p>

							<p class="fp4 in2"><i>'Yena yena hi maññanti,<br />
							tato taɱ hoti aññathā' ti.</i>|| ||</p>
					
							<p class="f4 in2">Of just this not-'Thus'-made acquirer of the First- [~+] <i>jhāna</i> then, the Lucky Man has said:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'In whatever way, by whomsoever such is imagined,<br />
							from that it becomes otherwise.</p>
							
							<p class="in2"><sup>1</sup> <i>atammayatā</i> Not in PED. <i>A + TAṂ + MAYATA</i> 'Thus' meaning awakened. But the explanation used by Ms. Horner serves just as well. The Awakened One is one who is Thirst-Freed'.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For a person who is not Arahant, all the <i>jhānas</i> from the first to the ending of perception and sense experience are states 'in the world'. They, in sequence, or from one only, are but a path to detachment, Nibbāna. Until the point where they are let go they are one and the same in their nature as part of the world: they are transient and do not belong to one though the 'not-Thus-made' imagines them to be 'acquired' 'by' 'himself' though they are none of these things. Subsequent to their being let go, they are let go and are seen as transient and not belonging to one.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The person not free from desire attains <i>jhāna</i> as a possession, not as a step along the way, itself to be seen as transient and not belonging to self and to be let go. He has imagined the state from what he has conceived it to be prior to attaining it and (however accurately he may have imagined it, as, for example, from a previous attainment) has therefore been chasing the past and that which he attains, upon it's being attained, is not what he imagined, but something different and still 'in the world'.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way a person experiencing hunger, remembers that which satisfied his hunger in past time and sets his mind on attaining that satisfaction again through the aquiring of that same meal again. What he does acquire is not what he imagined which is past and gone, but something new and different.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In essence, then, his effort at attainment has been fruitless: he has not gained what he imagined. Having focused on the <i>jhāna</i> itself he overlooks it's function as a steping-stone to detachment. Finding nothing in <i>jhāna</i> but the worldly attributes of the <i>jhāna</i>, being attched to those worldly attributes, he remains downbound to the world and subject to it's changeability and the pain that results from that changeability.<br />
					My say.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Horner: "Lack of desire<sup>2</sup> even for the attainment of the first meditation has been spoken of by the Lord; for whatever they imagine it to be, it is otherwise'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">She does not attempt to explain.</p>
					
					      <p class="in2"><sup>2</sup><i>atammayatā</i> This is <i>nittaṇhatā,</i> while <i>tammayatā</i> is <i>taṇha,</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 99, <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.047.pali.bd.htm#pg319">i. 319,</a> iii. 220, <i>A.</i> i. 150.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Thanissaro: 'The Blessed One has spoken of non-fashioning,<sup>3</sup> even with regard to attainment of the first <i>jhāna,</i> for by whatever means they construe it, it becomes otherwise from that.</p>
					
					      <p class="in2"><sup>3</sup> <i>Atammayata</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which he explains in a <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.113.than.ati.htm#n3">footnote</a>:</p>
					
					      <p class="in2">"In other words, whatever the condition of the ground on which one might base a state of becoming — a sense of one's self or the world one inhabits — by the time that state of becoming has taken shape, the ground has already changed. In this case, if one tries to shape a sense of self around one's attainment of jhana, the attainment itself has already changed."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi/Ñanamoli [Not available on line]: "Non-identification<sup>4</sup> (<i>atammayatā,</i>) even with the attainment of the first <i>jhāna</i> has been declared by the Blessed One; for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that.'</p>
					
							<p class="in2"><sup>4</sup>[#1066]: MA explains "non-identification" (<i>atammayatā,</i> lit. "not consisting of that") as the absence of craving. However, the context suggests that the absence of conceit may be the meaning. The statement "for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that" <i>(yena yena hi maññanti tato taɱ hoti aññathā)</i> is a philosophical riddle appearing also at <i>Sn</i> 588, <i>Sn</i> 757, and <i>Ud</i> 3:10. Though MA is silent, the <i>Udāna</i> commentary explains it to mean that in whatever way worldly people conceive any of the five aggregates - as self or self's belonging, etc. - the thing conceived turns out to be other than the aspect ascribed to it; it is not self or self's belonging, not "I" or "mine."</p>
							
					<p class="f4">Make up your own mind, but I think Bhk. Bodhi's explanation of his translation of <i>atammayatā,</i> as 'non-identification' is a little off track and not helpful in understanding the point. As to the rest of the comment it would better read: 'in whatever way worldly people conceive any thing (which described generally consists of the five piles: form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness) they will always be conceiving it as being permanent, belonging to self and pleasurable whereas the thing itself will always turn out to be transient, not belonging to the self and ultimately painful.</p>

						<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="yn1" href="#yfn1">1</a>]</sup> The Arab singular (whence the French "génie"); fem. Jinniyah; the Div and Rakshah of old Guebre-land and the "Rakshasa,' or "Yaksha," of Hinduism. It would be interesting to trace the evident connection, by no means "accidental," of "Jinn" with the "Genius" who came to the Romans through the Asiatic Etruscans, and whose name I cannot derive from "gignomai" or "genitus." He was unknown to the Greeks, who has the Daimon (<span class="spi">dai&amp;mwn</span>), a family which separated, like the Jinn and the Genius, into two categories, the good (Agatho-dæmons) and the bad (Kako-dæmons). We know nothing concerning the status of the Jinn amongst the pre-Moslemitic or pagan Arabs: the Moslems made him a supernatural anthropoid being, created of subtile fire (Koran, chapts. xv. 27; lv.14), not of earth like man, propagating his kind, ruled by mighty kings, the last being Ján bin Ján, missionarised by Prophets and subject to death and Judgment. From the same root are "Junún" = madness (i.e., possession or obsession by the Jinn) and "Majnún" = madman. According to R. Jeremiah bin Eliazar in Psalm xli. 5, Adam was excommunicated for one hundred and thirty years, during which he begat children in his own image (Gen. v. 3) and these were Mazikeen or Shedeem - Jinns.</p>

						<p class="f4">... when lo! a damsel appeared ahead and she was in tears. The King's son asked, "Who art thou?" and she answered, "I am daughter to a King among the Kings of Hind, and I was travelling with a caravan in the desert when drowsiness overcame me, and I fell from myu beast unwittingly; whereby I am cut off from my people and sore bewildered." The Prince, hearing these words, pitied her case and, mounting her on his horse's crupper, travelled until he passed by an old ruin, when the damsel said to him, "O my master, I wish to obey a call of nature": he therefore set her down at the ruin where she delayed so long that the King's son thought that she was only wasting time; so he followed her without her knowledge and belhold, she was a Ghúlah,† a wicked Ogress, who was saying to her brood, "O my children, this day I bring you a fine fat youth for dinner;" whereto they answered, "Bring him quick to us, O our mother, that we may browse upon him our bellies full."</p>
						
						<p class="f4">† The Ghúlah (fem. of Ghúl)[Ed. Goul] is the Heb. Lilith or Lills; the classical Lamia; the Hindu Yogini and Dàkini; the Chaldean Utug and Gigim (desert-demons) as opposed to the Mas (hill-demon) and Telal (who steal into towns); the Ogress of our tales and the Bala yaga [ed. Baba Yaga] of Russian folk-lore. Etymologically "Ghul" is a calamity, a panic fear; and the monster is evidently the embodied horror of the grave and the graveyard.</p>

						<p class="f4">... in Gandhāra, two thousand leagues away, there stands the city of Takkasilā. If you can reach that city, in seven days you will become king there. But there is peril on the road thither, in journeying through a great forest. It is double the distance round the forest that it is to pass through it. Ogres have their dwelling therein, and ogresses make villages and houses arise by the wayside. Beneath a goodly canopy embroidered with stars overhead, their magic sets a costly couch shut in by fair curtains of wondrous dye. Arranged in celestial splendour the ogresses sit within their abodes, seducing wayfarers with honied words. 'Weary you seem,' they say; 'come hither, and eat and drink before you journey further on your way.' Those that come at their bidding are given seats and fired to lust by the charm of their wanton beauty. But scarce have they sinned, before the ogresses slay them and eat them while the warm blood is still flowing. And they ensnare men's senses; captivating the sense of beauty with utter loveliness, the ear with sweet minstrelsy, the nostrils with heavenly odours, the taste with heavenly dainties of exquisite savour, and the touch with red-cushioned couches divinely soft. But if you can subdue your senses, and be strong in your resolve not to look upon them, then on the seventh day you will become king of the city of Takkasilā."</p>

					<p class="f4">By factoring in the force of the recipient's reaction or response plus the combined forces of all those that are influenced positively or negatively by the force of the actor's action on the recipient down through Time forever to the point where it is beyond notice.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We might say that if the pitcher's pitch represents the force of the action, then the force of the pitch, plus the response of the batter plus the reaction of the audience, boosters and detractors, plus the reaction of the team and the team owners, plus the reaction of the television sponsors, etc. etc. etc. down through Time represents the force returning to the pitcher.

					<p class="f4">This collection represents the unproofread, superficially reformatted files of the Dhammakaya-input Pali Text Society hard copy version of the Pali texts, otherwise known as 'the Goettingen files'.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With some exceptions noted below no effort has been made to proofread the 'Goettingen' files because our adaptation of the BJT Pali is being read against the PTS hard copy and has in addition the advantages of being fully unabridged and formatted according to the original and organizational phrase and paragraph breaks all of which will eventually make for a much more useful version of the Pali for both Dhamma researchers and Pali linguists. The PTS revisions are not intended to produce a 'critical' edition, and in effect act to preserve error.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Since even re-formatting involves checking against the hard copy for certain features, here and there I have made the occasional correction.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Revised editions of some volumes were not the editions used for the original 'Goettingen' conversion but there appears to have been some secondary and incomplete revision made based on the later versions. The revised editions retain the page breaks of the original hard copy edition, and all volumes of our html formatted edition have been subjected to a certain amount of correction based on the changes suggested in the revised editions — specifically where a search-and-replace function could be easily performed across all volumes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The 'Goettingen' files have converted what was the degree sign (&deg;) (indicating Feer's own (that is, not found in the original Pali) abridgment of some frequently used terms) into the hyphen. The problems caused in converting these back to the degree symbol are obvious. To do the job thoroughly would require a close proofreading of these files against the hard copy which is not within the scope of this posting as explained above. Some of these have been caught in passing, most are left as is. One problem that results is that occasionally a place where there were two degree signs together has further been mistaken for a single hyphenated word.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Researchers beware.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Each file represents a complete hard-copy volume. The files can be accessed from the top of the Index Page for each Nikaya volume, but the individual suttas are not linked-to from the Index pages and sutta translations are not linked to this version of the Pali.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><i>[Pages in all these files can be found or linked-to by appending "#pg000" (three digits in all cases, i.e.: 001) to the end of the url for that file. For example:</i><br />

Some of the changes listed were made in the original 'Goettingen files'. The most important of these to note is that all footnotes were removed and content straddling page breaks has had content moved back to the preceding page sometimes in units of whole phrases. The relation to the original pagination will therefore sometimes be off by several lines.</p>

					<p class="f4">These files were reproduced from those originally located on the Journal of Buddhist Ethics website. These are the files (but from the version found on Metta Net Lanka) on which the hybrid BJT/PTS version of the Pali which is linked-to from all sutta translations on this site. The files here presented are the 'raw' unproofed, unedited and unformatted original files found on that site. Only the headers, footers and PTS page number references have been altered.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This version of these files appears to have had some slight proofreading done over the version I have used, and it retains footnotes (generally regarding alternative readings). The footnotes are not linked to and from their point of reference, but are indicated by number within pages and are found at the end of each page.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The page numbering, especially in the Samyutta Nikaya, is haphazard due especially to copy and paste errors, but also apparently from fatigue. I have done no more to straighten out the mess than to insure that there are no duplicate 'id's' which would have produced html errors.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What you need to know is that the Pali text linked-to from the translations on this site has, for the most part, been proofed against the hard copy of the PTS Pali. Where the sutta was not proofread it will most closely resemble the BJT version presented above.</p>

					(The Sacred Books of the East translation of Vinaya Texts by T.W. Rhys Davids and Hermann Oldenberg consists of 3 Volumes, #s 13, 17, and 20. Volume 13, which contains the Patimokkha and the start of the Maha Vagga, was previously uploaded to this site. This completes the html formatting of Volumes 17 and 20 which completes the <i>Vinaya Texts</i>)<br />
					This work is especially important in that it is to it that the references to the Vinaya Pitaka in the PTS translations are directed. Finding the reference to the Vinaya Texts it is then easy to locate the same chapter in the PTS Horner translation by reference to the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm">Vinaya Index.</a></p>

						<p class="f4">"We received no food. We lived on snow; it took the place of bread. The days resembled the nights, and the nights left in our souls the dregs of their darkness. The train rolled slowly, often halted for a few hours, and continued. ... There followed days and nights of traveling. ... One day when we had come to a stop, a worker took a piece of bread out of his bag and threw it into a wagon. There was a stampede. Dozens of starving men fought desperately over a few crumbs. ... A crowd of workmen and curious passersby had formed all along the train. They had undoubtedly never seen a train with this kind of cargo. Soon, pieces of bread were falling into the wagons from all sides. And the spectators observed these emaciated creatures ready to kill for a crust of bread.</p>

						<p class="f4">A piece fell into our wagon. ... I saw, not far from me, an old man dragging himself on all fours. He had just detached himself from the struggling mob. He was holding one hand to his heart. At first I thought he had received a blow to his chest. Then I understood: he was hiding a piece of bread under his shirt. With lightning speed he pulled it out and put it to his mouth. His eyes lit up, a smile, like a grimace, illuminated his ashen face. And was immediately extinguished. A shadow had lain down beside him. And this shadow threw itself over him. Stunned by the blows, the old man was crying: "Meir, my little Meir! Don't you recognize me ... You're killing your father ... I have bread ... for you too ... for you too ..." He collapsed. But his fist was still clutching a small crust. He wanted to raise it to his mouth. But the other threw himself on him. The old man mumbled something, groaned, and died. Nobody cared. His son searched him, took the crust of bread, and began to devour it. He didn't get far. Two men had been watching him. They jumped him. Others joined in. When they withdrew there were two dead bodies next to me, the father and the son.</p>

					Sariputta and Maha Cunda visit Channa who is dying a painful death. Channa announces he will 'take the knife' (commit suicide). Sariputta questions him as to his understanding of Dhamma and Maha Cunda recites for him a saying of the Buddha warning against the wavering that results from attachments. Later, after Channa has 'taken the knife' Sariputta questions the Buddha as to Channa's fate. The Buddha states that his was a blameless end.<br />

The Buddha confirms Ānanda's explanation.<br />

						<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="na" href="#fna">a</a>]</sup> <i>Samudaya.</i> Own-arising = Arising as own-this or that. I have said that no other translator has recognized the 'sam' in this word, but this is not correct. Bhk. Thanissaro periodically but not in the case of SN 4.35.204, has 'co-arising' (but I am not sure what he has in mind with/by this translation: 'co' = 'with', but with what? It has arisen, consequent upon thirst, as a result of the intent to experience some experience of some individual; it arises attached to the notion 'my' or 'I am'.). Most translators use just 'arising' or 'origination', but this misses the vital information that this 'arising' is the arising of a thing in the shape of something of one's own.</p>

					Is it barley or corn? PED says 'corn', but in Britain 'corn' is wheat. Corn, 'maize', was not introduced into India until somewhere around 300 AD (so they say  — actually they say it was much later than that, (c. 1400), but there is good evidence that the Chinese were trading with the Mexicans as well as the Indians around 300 AD.).

					The Buddha teaches that the five stockpiles (khandha: body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness) amount to a burden, that the asumption of individuality can be termed the grasping of the burden, that desire for experience through the senses, desire to be, and the desire for more being, un-being, or re-being is the lifting up of the burden, and that the laying down of the burden is the utter eradication of desire.<br />

					The Buddha teaches that what is to be understood is body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness and what is called understanding is having completely eradicated lust, hatred and blindness.<br />
					Another way of saying this is that until you have completely eliminated lust, anger and blindness you have not yet fully understood body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness.<br />

					The Buddha teaches that it is only by thoroughly understanding, being detached from, and giving up body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness that attainment of the ending of pain is possible.<br />
					The word to understand here is <i>abhijāna: abhi + jñā;</i> <i>abhi</i> = over; <i>jñā</i> = to know. PED relates this to memory or recollection and knowledge achieved through experience; Bhk. Bodhi appears to go with it's association with <i>abhiññā</i> which is a higher form of knowledge especially associated with magic powers. His translation in this context ('directly knowing') would imply knowing extra sensorily, seeing things without the intervention of identification with an experiencer of them. Here in this sutta <i>abhijāna</i> is found in a list which would seem to point to an understanding at a somewhat lower level, that is an intellectual, (accomplished by way of recollection) comprehension which would remind one of the instability, painful and selfless nature of the object. In other words to understand this as 'directly knowing' would be to start out at too high a level, beginning at the end result. Starting out at that point would not require becoming detached and giving up; these things are already aspects of directly knowing. ... but perhaps this is an instruction that is intended to be heard at two levels. I hear <i>jñā or ññā</i> as our 'Yes?' or 'Yeah? or Germanic 'Ja?' with pointing finger or hand jesture meaning 'is this not so?', 'do you see?' = 'you know?''you understand?' So I would hear 'above knowing' in this way as 'comprehensive knowledge' or 'knowledge beyond doubt' because achieved through experience. So in that sense 'direct', but 'direct' is not found in the etymology. The alternate title for this sutta 'Parijana' would indicate that <i>abhiññā</i> was a synonym and meant something like 'thorough' knowledge (Woodward's translation).<br />

					The Buddha teaches that it is by putting away wish-lust associated with body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness that these things are abandoned in such a way as to prevent their arising again in the future.<br />
					<i>Chanda-Rāga,</i> and other similar compounds are mostly translated 'x and y'. But Pali can be constructed 'x-y' as easily as English, and I suggest that the intent of making these a compound is to have them understood as a compound. Here literally 'wish-rage' (rage as in 'it's all the rage') 'wish-lust' (the madness of wishing which would emphasize that what was being spoken of was a broad spectrum of wishes more clearly than the two ideas 'wishing' and 'lust' separately) or 'lust-wishing' (wishing for things giving rise to lust); at least 'lustful wishing' or 'wishful lusting'. In cases where we have two persons linked in a compound (Sariputta-Moggallāna) too I suggest that they are, when spoken of this way, to be understood as more closely linked than if separated by the 'and'. Something to be thought of as a single unit. The 'Sariputta-Moggallāna' team. So such compounds were intended to 'unite to emphasize'.<br />

					<i>Assāda, ādīnava, and nissaraṇa.</i> Woodward: satisfaction, misery, escape. Bodhi: Gratification, danger, escape. <i>Assāda</i> is neither satisfaction, which is the state of having had enough; nor gratification which is the state of having reached a point where one is thankful to have had an experience; it is just the experiencing itself of whatever pleasure is to be had. <i>Ādīnava</i> im-poverished, miserable. That is the danger, but the word is not 'danger'. <i>Nissaraṇa</i> out-the on-flow. It is less the escape from than the stopping of the on-flow of body, etc. The difference being that 'escape' more even than 'release from' or 'freedom from' implies an escapee, but the emphasis here is much more on the stopping of the on-rolling of the khandhas than the freedom from them.<br />

					The Buddha declares that he who takes delight in the form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness is not free from pain, but he who is free from such delight is free from pain.<br />
					How does this work? Delight is one step removed from sensation. Delight is not the arising of pleasant sensation, it is the indulging in the enjoyment of that sensation, and is therefore fuel for the furtherence of existence. The act of indulging in delight has as it's counterpart existence. By not indulging in delight upon the arising of pleasant sensation, there is no fuel with counterpart in existence.

					The Buddha defines what he calls the stockpiles (khandha) and what he calls the fueled stockpiles (upadana-kkhandha).<br />
					A very important distinction is made here between <i>khandha</i> and <i>upādānakkhandha</i>. It is not form, sense-experience, perception, the own-made, and consciousness themselves that are the fuel supporting existence and rebirth; it is the delight with, the obsession with the lust, anger and blindness associated with these things that is that fuel. The distinction is being made between that which is already done, or that which exists externally, and that which is being contemplated, the subject of obsession, lust, anger and blindness. Body as seen objectively and body as seen in conjunction with the idea 'my'. If one is going to use the translation 'grasping' or 'clinging' for 'upadana', then the translation of 'upadanakkhandha' would be 'grasped-after-form...' or 'clung-to-form.' Woodward here uses 'factor that has to do with grasping' which passes, elsewhere he has used 'grasping-heaps' which gives the wrong sense: the heap is not grasping! That's something out of a horror movie. Bhk. Bodhi has 'subject to clinging' and has used 'affected by clinging' both of which are misdirections: the idea is that it is clinging to, or grasping after or the fueling based on or connected with body, etc, that gives rise to existence; this is not pointing to a thing there that is a clinging-affected body or a body that has been subjected to clinging. ... or maybe it is. Body is something that has become by way of clinging. But then if this term is to stand for both the obsessing that arises based on body and the body that arises based on obsessing, the term to be found must reflect both sides of the picture.<br />

					In this sutta individualized consciousness is shown as being dependent on a person's attachment to and taking up of form, sensation, perception, and own-making, and that when attachment is let go consciousness is liberated.<br />
					Please note: I have revised my translation of this sutta in an important way. What is being taught in this sutta is what is called 'The Four Sticking-Points of Consciousness', [<i>catasso viññāṇaṭṭhitiyo</i> PED:  "[pp. of <i>tiṭṭhati</i> = Gr. <span class="spi">stato/s</span>, Latin status, Celt. fossad (firm) (ed: ? fossilized)] standing, i. e. (see <i>ṭhāna</i> I) either upright (opp. <i>nisinna,</i> etc.), or immovable, or being, behaving in general."] usually translated 'The Four Stations of Consciousness'. I suggest 'sticking-points' here more clearly points to the idea that when consciousness is 'stuck' on these four it is not free, but that when unstuck, it is the equivalent of Nibbāna. With consciousness anchored to these four 'sticking-points' it is bound up in individuality, is said to have come into existence, to have been own-made and to be subject to further own-made existence, and is not free. Free from this attachment to these four things and lust, anger and blindness related to consciousness itself it is not bound up in individuality, has not come into existence, is not subject to further own-made existence, and is free. In my previous translation, blindly misunderstanding an abridgment of the four as an abridgment of the five khandhas, I had included Consciousness as a fifth station. The distinction between the five khandhas and the four sticking points is important. Understanding that there is a distinction, allows for the idea that consciousness, free from lust can be freed from existence. The asavas in connection with consciousness must be eliminated, but consciousness connected with the asavas is always consciousness fueled by thoughts and obsessions concerning the four 'sticking points'. It is not, in and of itself a sticking point. But in a turn of words not uncommon in the suttas consciousness, when freed from the asavas, is said to be 'stuck' on consciousness of freedom.<br />
					This is a very important sutta! It is in this sutta we get the very important idea that there is no individualized consciousness apart from form, sensation, perception and own-making. That is that consciousness is conditioned. But here also we see that consciousness (when freed from attachment to the Four Sticking-Points) is equated with Nibbāna.<br />
					The difficult idea to understand is that the consciousness that results from the elimination of the asavas is conditioned by not-doing. That which is not-done is not own-made and that which results from non-doing is similarly not own-made. That which is not own-made has not come into existence. Not having come into existence it does not pass out of existence. The object of this consciousness (that which it is 'stuck' on) is freedom from existence. This is the nature of that freed consciousness.<br />
					It is also important these days (Sunday, July 31, 2016 9:19 AM) to see that that latter consciousness was not there all the time waiting for you to become aware of it (as with the idea of the Bodhi mind) (it was conditioned, it arose consequent upon not-doing). It is something that must be cultivated such that it becomes a habitat of mind: Nibbāna. The way to do that is the Aristocratic Eight-dimensional High Way.<br />
					It's: "All own-made things are unstable."<br />
					It is not: "All conditioned things are unstable."<br />
					Look it up.</p>

					The Buddha explains how if shapes, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness were not identified with now, there would be no future existence of identified-with shapes, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness and the pain they bring with them.<br />
					Note here the translation of <i>'sankhata'</i> (a synonym for <i>saŋkhārā</i>) is translated by Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi (and as one possibility in the PED) as 'conditioned.' This carries with it the same problems that translating <i>saŋkhārā</i> as 'conditioned' creates. One is supposed to see that '<i>sankhata</i>-ed' consciousness is a problem (because it has been <i>sankhta</i>-ed it has come into existence and will pass out of existence), but translating it this way we must also accept the idea that the consciousness that is equivalant to Nibbāna cannot be 'conditioned'. But it is conditioned. It is just not <i>sankhata</i>-ed: own-made. It has come about as a result of not-doing — the not-doing of those things described in the Magga. It has not been made as a result of the identification by an individual with the intent to create experience which is <i>sankhata</i>-ing. If you don't have this distinction you cannot find Nibbāna. You will find yourself in an endless battle with the idea of the obliteration of consciousness and the idea that Nibbāna is not annihilation. Consciousness arises based on conditions. Some conditions cause consciousness to arise as to a self: those forms of consciousness which have been own-made. The forms of consciousness which have been own-made are unstable. That form of consciousness which has been conditioned by not-doing has not been own-made. Not having been own-made it does not enter existence. Not having entered existence it does not pass out of existence. It has as it's object freedom from the own-made. With that as it's object, it is stable.</p>

					The Buddha describes the stockpiles (kandha) in detail and shows how they are to be analyzed according to the Four Truths.<br />
					In this sutta where it is translated: Woodward: "And what is body ... consciousness? It is these six seats of ... "; Bhk. Bodhi: "And what is form ... consciousness. There are these six classes of ..."; Bhk. Thanissaro: "And what is form ... consciousness? These six classes of ...", what is being translated as "And what is ..." is <i>"Katamāñ ca x?",</i> and what is being translated as "seats of", "classes of", is "x-<i>kāyā</i>". Normally translating <i>"Katamāñ ca x?",</i> as "And what is ..." does not create problems, but it should be heard in this case (and perhaps in every case for clarity) as it is in the Pali: "And what x?" (of x's, which is being spoken of here?) and "x-<i>kāyā</i>" (x-body), should be heard, so say I, as "embodied-form," ... "embodied-consciousness". This needs to be the case in this case because there is, at least in the case of consciousness, consciousness which is not embodied, that is, that has not come into existence, has not become identified-with by an individual and does not need to be escaped from. As currently translated this leaves us with the idea that consciousness is to be annihilated and contradiction in the suttas where it is clearly pointed out (see <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p53">—SN 3.22.53</a>) that freed consciousness is Nibbāna.<br />

					The Buddha Explains the difference between a Buddha and an Arahant.<br />
					The Pali title of this sutta is <i>'Sambuddho';</i> the full description of a Buddha is <i>'Sammā-sambuddha'.</i> An Arahant could be said to be Consummately (or Perfectly or fully) Awakened <i>(sammā-buddho)</i>. The 'sam' is important. Here this sutta is showing the difference between the consummately awakened Arahant and a Buddha. What is that difference? It is that a Buddha is 'Self-Awakened'. Awakened without the assistance of another.<br />
					I emphasize this here, of course, in order to point out that in other cases the <i>sa', sam, saŋ, saɱ</i> (as in the case ... ahum ... of <i>saŋkhārā</i>) should not be ignored.<br />

					The Buddha affirms that the most fundamental way of describing things (shapes, sense-experiences, perceptions, the own-make, and consciousness) is relative to their position in Time.<br />
					<i>Nirutti-patha</i> 'the path down to the root'. <i>Nirutti</i> is actually a super-normal power: the ability to see or intuit the etymology of words, idioms, expressions. Here that power is being spoken of relative to the perception of the seer of a world outside of Time where what is seen can give the appearance that all things already exist in every potential variation, and that it is essential for communication (and even perception) in ordinary or consensus reality to describe (and even experience) things relative to their order in what is understood to be Time. This sutta describes how that order is determined. This sutta will seem simple-minded to some. This is, however a serious problem for some who have chanced upon perception outside of time accidentally, and we can imagine a time before Time when the Great Spirit was contimplating individual existence and trying to figure out how that could be accomplished. Think of the situation where because Time has not yet been invented, you come across yourself able to see yourself simultaneously as an adult, as a child or as an old man, able to go in any and all directions at the same time. This way Madness lies.<br />

					<i>Samudaya Saŋ + udaya</i> = Own, Self up-and-out. Translated throughout, including PED as 'arise' or 'origin', but which translation does not account for the <i>'saŋ'.</i> In meaning 3 'produce, revenue', I believe we see the intent. It is the 'in-come' or arising to the self of something. Alternatively it could be 'arising as the self' of something. This, along with translating <i>'saŋkhāārā'</i> as own-making shakes to it's foundations the existing translations and understanding of what the Buddha taught. The difference in this case is the difference between saying "This is how pain arises." versus "This is how your own personal pain arises." The second is much more likely to inspire engagement.<br />

					Beginning with a discussion of what it is that one speaks of when one speaks of recollecting past lives, the Buddha then gives some detailed explanation of what is to be understood by form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness. Then speaking of these things as unstable, painful and not self he describes the arahant as becoming disgsted at them and by that becoming free and by perceiving freedom in that freedom, reaching arahantship. Then further he describes such a one as one who neither heaps up or reduces, neither lets go nor takes up, neither scatters nor gathers.<br />

					The Buddha explains that the bhikkhus have entered 'the lowest profession', that of scrap (or 'chunk', or 'glob' or 'mess') hunters, not from want of a livlihood or fears, but because it is in this way that some way out of all the pain in the world may be found.<br />

					Describing a method for quickly eliminating the corrupting influences of lust, existing and blindness, the Buddha shows how holding any sort of opinion or view that the self is, or has, or has within or is within shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, or consciousness, or even having doubt about such is own-making, and that which is own-made, is inconstant, and that which is inconstant is painful and that by getting rid of such opinions and doubts, one quickly gets rid of the corrupting influences.</p>

						<p class="f4">At <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p96">SN 3.22.96-97-98</a> the Buddha says:</p>

						<p class="f4">And at <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p53">SN 3.22.53</a> He says:</p>

						<p>[<i>If beggars, a beggar has let go of lust for the characteristic of consciousness with lust let go,</i> there is no foothold for the sticking of consciousness.]</p>

						<p class="f4">This consciousness,<br />
						without even a <b>miniscule foothold for sticking</b>:<br />

						<p>Bhikkhu Thanissaro: Consciousness, thus unestablished, not proliferating, not performing any function, is released. Owing to its release, it is steady. Owing to its steadiness, it is contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated.</p>

						<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi: "When that consciousness is unestablished, not coming to growth, nongenerative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated.</p>

						<p>Woodward:  Without that platform consciousness has no growth, it generates no action and is freed: by freedom it is steady: by its steadiness it is happy: owing to happiness it is not troubled.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">How is this apparent contradiction to be resolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">I think the complication rests on the translation of 'atthi' as 'is' ("is there?") rather than 'exists' ("does there exist?") Translating as "does there exist" we can call in the Buddha's definition of 'existing' as that which has been sankaram-ed, or has come into existence through contact with named form, or been experienced through the senses and we can set up the contrast between these suttas as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Does there exist any consciousness that is stable?</p>

					<p class="f4">No there does not exist any consciousness that is stable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness that has not been own-made, that has not been fueled by lust for form, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness, has not come into existence, is un-stuck, stuck only on freedom from being stuck, and is a name for Nibbāna.</p>

'Dhamma' (lower case 'd') can correctly be translated 'phenomena', but the addition of 'mental' to this term here is an explanation, not a translation. The objects of the mind sense are the sense-consciousnesses of the other five senses plus memories. In the same way that a computer program is built up from short bits of information — some directly input, others held in memory — which interact in such a way as to produce intelligible images, actions, conclusions and new memories, the images produced by the five lower senses are composed in ways directed by memory into composite pictures which are in turn composed into animated stories ...

					The Buddha teaches Dhamma for letting go of The All through thoroughly known higher knowledge.<br />
					Accomplish letting go by way of <i>abhiññā pariññā.</i> <i>Abhiññā</i> could be, as Bhk. Bodhi has it, 'direct knowledge', if one thinks of over-knowing as observing directly, but the term is most frequently associated with higher knowledge or at least superior knowledge close to magic powers. I think now that 'superior knowledge' would work best for all situations. Seeing the origin and passing away of things is superior to the common way of seeing things as stable in one's world. <i>Pariññā</i> is easier. Pari = pass around = all-round = thorough. One is to see the unstable nature of a thing by obsering that it comes to be and passes out of existence. That is your superior knowledge. Then one applies one's understanding that that which is unstable is painful because we do not like our pleasures to end and that which is painful is not worthy to be called the self or one's own. Seeing and understanding in this way one sees that a thing can give no lasting satisfaction and is therefore not worth pursuiing and one lets one's desire for it fade out. By the ending of desire, the thing is let go.<br />

					The Buddha presents the best method for the uprooting of thoughts about 'I am' and 'me.'<br />
					The important word to understand here and in the next two suttas is <i>maññati:</i> to think about, to form an opinion about, to adopt a point of view about. PED: to think, to be of opinion, to imagine, to deem. Woodward's 'conceit' introduces more complexity to the idea than is necessary, and does not well fit the usual way the word is used (e.g.: in the expression: 'What do you think about this?' or 'What is your opinion about this?'). 'Conceit' is frequently used in the PTS translations with the apparent intent 'to have an unwarranted notion that a certain thing is the self or one's own', but in most cases, as here, would would better be understood in the sense of 'having an opinion about', 'having a point of view about'. It is not observation that is the danger, it is forming opinions about what is observed that is the danger. Bhk. Bodhi appears to be using the word 'conceive' in the sense of create, to think up, to imagine the thing itself, which is I suggest a misunderstanding of the suttas. At the least it doesn't hold up across the set of applications that are to be avoided. "He does not think about; he does not think about the sensations that arise from; he does not think 'in that', 'of that'; he does not think 'I am that' 'this is my'. What is being spoken of here is the formation of points of view subsequent to observation where it is being pointed out that whatever opinion one forms is immediately wrong because things being in a constant state of becoming, change and cannot, because of that, be or belong to the self.

The deeper meaning is that this word is to be understood to be a term for 'the all'. All that which has come to be is subject to breaking apart, disintegration; that is 'the world'.</p>

					<p class="f4">C. Wright Mills, writing about modern conditioning of mass opinion by the media, but applicable to all the forms of conditioning beings are subjected to from birth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very little of what we think we know of the social realities of the world have we found out first-hand. Most of 'the pictures in our heads' we have gained from these media — even to the point where we often do not really believe what we see before us until we read about it in the paper or hear about it on the radio. The media not only give us information; they guide our very experiences. Our standards of credulity, our standards of reality, tend to be set by these media rather than by our own fragmentary experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, even if the individual has direct, personal experience of events, it is not really direct and primary: it is organized in stereotypes. It takes long and skillful training to so uproot such stereotypes that an individual sees things freshly, in an unstereotyped manner. One might suppose, for example, that if all the people went through a depression they would all 'experience it,' and in terms of this experience, that they would all debunk or reject or at least refract what the media say about it. But experience of such a structural shift has to be organized and interpreted if it is to count in the making of opinion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The kind of experience, in short, that might serve as a basis for resistance to mass media is not an experience of raw events, but the experience of meanings. The fleck of interpretation must be there in the experience if we are to use the word experience seriously. And the capacity for such experience is socially implanted. The individual does not trust his own experience, as I have said, until it is confirmed by others or by the media. Usually such direct exposure is not accepted if it disturbs loyalties and beliefs that the individual already holds. To be accepted, it must relieve or justify the feelings that often lie in the back of his mind as key features of his ideological loyalties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stereotypes of loyalty underlie beliefs and feelings about given symbols and emblems; they are the very ways in which men see the social world and in terms of which men make up their specific opinions and views of events. They are the results of previous experience, which affect present and future experience. It goes without saying that men are often unaware of these loyalties, that often they could not formulate them explicitly. Yet such general stereotypes make for the acceptance or the rejection of specific opinions not so much by the force of logical consistency as by their emotional affinity and by the way in which they relieve anxieties. To accept opinions in their terms is to gain the good solid feeling of being correct without having to think. When ideological stereotypes and specific opinions are linked in this way, there is a lowering of the kind of anxiety which arises when loyalty and belief are not in accord. Such ideologies lead to a willingness to accept a given line of belief; then there is no need, emotionally or rationally, to overcome resistance to given items in that line; cumulative selections of specific opinions and feelings become the pre-organized attitudes and emotions that shape the opinion-life of the person.</p>

					<p class="f4">These deeper beliefs and feelings are a sort of lens through which men experience their worlds, they strongly condition acceptance or rejection of specific opinions, and they set men's orientation towards prevailing authorities."</p>

					The Buddha teaches a variation of the Paticca Samuppada which works back from the elimination of the corrupting influences (asavas) and he states that there is no destroying the corrupting influences without knowing and seeing this progression.<br />
					A very important sutta! Sometimes called the positive version of the Paticca Samuppada.<br />
					This is the issue with regard to this sutta: If you follow the sequence through without careful reflection on the idea that there is no thing that is the self, you can come to the conclusion that once a living being has become, it will end in Nibbāna. No need to do anything. This statement has been made, and is one of the fundamental bases of Mahayana Buddhism.
					The formulation in this sutta lead to the statement that all things (dhammas) end in Nibbāna and from there to the belief that this means 'all beings', and that this could and would be attained by all beings simultaneously (and further, that we should put off attaining Nibbāna until that happens).
					But the Buddha is not saying this. He is saying that it is <i>seeing the process</i> which leads to the conclusion in Nibbāna. There is no statement there that the whole process occurs for each occurance of blindness bringing consciousness into existence.
					There is nothing in this formula which stipulates the Time the process will consume. There is no statement in the suttas and there is no basis in the theory of the arising of living beings that is the Paticca Samuppada, for a belief that there is a fixed number of beings, or that new beings are not arising all the time. In fact the opposite is clearly indicated. There is no thing there that is 'the living being.' Like bubbles in beer, living beings arise as a result of conditions; it is a construction made up of name/form and consciousness brought into self-aware existence from factors, primarily blindness, the idea 'I am', and the desire to be, and the supply of these factors, and primarily of blindness in the limitless universe is limitless. The statement is also made in the form: "All Dhammas (teachings of the Buddhas) end in Nibbāna." This statement, while true in spirit, is not absolutely true. The Buddha taught many things at many different levels, not all of which pointed directly to and end in Nibbāna. For example he taught generosity, loving kindness, care for parents, and self-control as a matter of making good kamma.<br />

					Sariputta teaches Venerable Bumija who asks about who causes kammic consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in kammic consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Gotama goes on to explain that pleasure and pain corespond to the intent with which deeds of body, speech and mind are done. He further explains that intent can originate with the self or with another and can be done by the self either knowingly or without reflection.</p>

						<h4 class="ctr">On Kamma</h4>

						<p class="f4">When one reaches the point where one can see the ever-changing nature of all existing things, and one has not heard the thoughts, and seen that this is the way things are, that is:</p>

						<p class="f4">"All own-made things change.</p>

						<p class="f4">All own-made things are essentially Painful.</p>

						<p class="f4">All things are not-self."</p>

						<p class="f4">one can come to confusion as to 'who' originates and 'who' experiences deeds and their results.</p>

						<p class="f4">The opinions can be formed:<br />
						"One being does the deed, another experiences the result."<br />
						"One and the same being does the deed and experiences the result."<br />
						"Both the self and another do the deed and experience the result."<br />
						"Neither the self nor another do the deed or experience the result."</p>

						<p class="f4"><a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 2.12.25</a> clarifies the issues: What is actually the case is that the doing of a deed and the experience of the result are both results of <b>connection</b> (phassa, touch, contact).</p>

						<p class="f4">Where there are deeds of body, speech, and mind, identified-with consequences are experienced in the form of sensations of pleasure or pain or sensation that is neither painful nor pleasant. Ignorance results in <b>connection</b> to the doing of deeds of body, speech and mind. <b>Connection</b> to the deed results in <b>connection</b> to, being identified with, the experience.</p>

						<p class="f4">Deeds are instigated <b>connected</b> to (consequent upon) ignorance of the painful consequences.</p>

						<p class="f4">Deeds are instigated either by the self, or by another. In either case the deed results in being <b>connected</b> to, being identified with, the experience.</p>

						<p class="f4">Deeds are instigated with self-awareness, or without self-awareness. In either case the deed results in being in <b>connected</b> to, being identified with, the experience.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is the explanation of the short and long forms of the Paticca Samuppada:</p>

						<p class="f4"><b><i>This being, that becomes.</i></b></p>

						<p class="f4"><b>Connected</b> to ignorance there is <b>connection</b> to own-makng,<br />
						<b>connected</b> to own-making there is <b>connection</b> to (identification with) consciousness,<br />

						<b>connected</b> to the six sense realms there is <b>connection,</b><br />
						<b>connected</b> there are identified-with sensations of pleasure or pain or neither pain nor pleasure arising from sense-experience, and taking form in accordance with the intent <b>connected</b> with the doing of the deed whether done to cause pain, to cause pleasure or to end kamma, and in magnitude relative to the detachment of the doer, the usefulness for detachment of the deed, and the detachment of the recipient of the deed,<br />
						<b>connected</b> to sensations there is <b>connection</b> to hungers, (to get, to get away from, to attain Nibbāna)<br />
						<b>connected</b> to hungers there is <b>connection</b> to the thinking and pondering, the wishing and wanting, the dreaming of, mooning after, desire for, grasping after, the getting bound up in and to, the intending to get that fuels the fire of existence,<br />
						<b>connected</b> to the fuel there is <b>connection</b> to existence,<br />
						<b>connected</b> to existence there is <b>connection</b> to birth,<br />
						<b>connected</b> to birth there is <b>connection</b> to aging, sickness and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery,<br />
						and despair.</p>

						<p class="f4"><b><i>From the ending of this, the ending of that.</i></b></p>

						<p class="f4">From the disconnection from ignorance, from seeing things as they are there is disconnection from own-making,<br />
						disconnected from own-making there is disconnection from (identified-with) consciousness,<br />
						disconnected from (identified-with) consciousness there is disconnection from name/form,<br />

						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery,<br />
						and despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">Viewing the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> this way, we should go back and revise our thinking of the translation of the P.S. as it is usually put, that is that what <i>nidāna,</i> 'down-bound' (literally); and <i>piṭacca</i> 'rebounding off', 'resulting in,' 'depending on'; means is 'being tied up to or connected to', that is 'identified with'; and what 'arises' means is that there being such a connection to a thing, there is the 'own-arising' — an identified-with-arising — <i>(saɱ-upada)</i> of such. This accounts for the otherwise unaccounted for in all translations <i>'saɱ'</i>.<br />
						Think of an un-identified with consciousness identifying with consciousness of named-forms, acting to create further identified-with experience and identifying with the resulting phenomena. Think of it as the world occurring and rolling on in front of this unidentified-with consciousness and that a big mistake was made in identifying with that world and an individual in it (contacting it) and which can be corrected only by letting go of this identification (this contact).<br />
						The translations have been conditioning us to view the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> from within the personal world, rather than as a process that is occuring externally. This sutta does much to break down that conditioning.</p>

						<p class="f4">As Ānanda puts it: It is marvelous to think that this whole Damma could be summed up in this one idea that the origin of Pain is Contact. That is, identification with the world and an individual in it.</p>

This sequence could be placed between 'There being blindness, ownmanking'; or 'There being consciousness, name/form;' or, leapfroging: 'There being blindness, name/form' or 'There being fuel, existence'. Put this sutta together with <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p16">SN 2.12.16</a> and you will be able to see that the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> is more than a linear description of the coming to be of pain and it is also more than a three-life description and it is also more than a moment-to-moment description. It is all of these and more. Each link is in effect the entire process and the focus of the link should be seen in each case as being just the surface representation of one salient feature.</p>

						<p class="f4">There being an object, consciousness stands fast.</p>

						<p class="f4">There being growth of established consciousness, there is coming down into name/form.</p>

						<p>You should see that this 'pondering' or 'planning' must be being done by an already established relationship between consciousness and name/form, i.e., a thinking being. So this is not intended to show 'original' origination; it is intended to show a continuation of origination. It focuses for the time being on a single aspect.</p>

					The Buddha describes how the student of the Aristocrats is free from doubts concerning the origin and ending of pain (dukkha).<br />
					This and the previous sutta are identical with the exception that in the first, in all editions but the Burmese, the Paticca Samuppada sequence begins with nama/rupa. This 'omition' has been added in in brackets by Bhk. Bodhi and Rhys Davids, but I suggest that this is really two different suttas and that the idea of it beginning with nama/rupa is itself instructive. Blindness yielding up own-making is done by an existing nama/rupa with consciousness. The beginning point of the S.P. is not iron-bound to one of it's links. This sort of 'clarification' is frequent in the Burmese edition of the Pali.<br />

					An outline of the practice to be used by the person interested in comprehending the Paticca Samuppada.<br />
					An important sutta for understanding the method of investigation. The word used here is <i>Parivīmaɱsa.</i> <i>Pari</i> = pass-around; <i>vīmaɱsa:</i> re-member, in the sense of pondering over bringing to mind the various aspects of a thing. This is translated by Bhk. Bodhi as 'thorough investigation' which is also used for the translation of <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> (tracing back in memory the origin of a thing). The distinction is that <i>Parivīmaɱsa</i> encompasses <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> and then projects it forward into those insights which should arise from the determination of the origin of a thing. Generally, however, <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> is more frequently encountered and apparently is assumed to result in these insights.<br />

					The Buddha likens contimplation of delight in sense pleasures to throwing fuel on a fire.<br />
					<i>Upādāna</i> again. This is a great example of how early translations influence later translations to the exclusion of reasoned reflection. We must credit Bhk. Thanissaro for a break from 'grasping' and 'clinging' even though he has used 'clinging' in his translation of this sutta. He was first to note that what <i>Upādāna</i> really stood for was 'fuel' that which supports coming into existence. It is not just 'grasping' but must encompass a much broader spectrum of ideas. The literal meaning of the word is 'Up-giving' or 'up-binding'. We say 'fuel-up'. I have used 'bind-up' and 'support' in an effort to stick closer to the etymology and have used 'fuel' or 'fueling' occasionally. In any case this sutta should have openened everyone's eyes, but the early translator's understanding of the Paticca Samuppada as a progressive series of causes made them seek out a word which more closely fit their idea of what would result in the coming to be of an individual and blinded everyone to the idea that what this was was the work of mind, pondering, wishing and intending that fueled the fire of existence.<br />

					The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he compairs the mind to a monkey traveling from branch to branch.<br />
					An interesting point to be noted in this sutta is the way the Buddha speaks of 'this very heart' <i>(citta)</i> or 'this very mind' <i>(mano)</i> or 'this very consciousness' <i>(viññāṇa)</i> as being synonyms for each other in essentially the same way we think about these things. K. Nizamis argues in a footnote that the use here of these terms as we find them is not to be understood this way. That they are not to be understood as synonyms. And that this is an Abhidhamma interpretation. That being the case, I find myself for the first time agreeing with the Abhidhamma! I do not say that these terms do not have specialized meanings. Indeed I have argued for translating them with terms that more precisely point out their differences than are currently used, but in the case we have here what the Buddha is talking about is the common way of understanding what we call our mind which various forms are all thought of as the same thing, that is 'mind'. Here to take Nizamis' understanding would be to warp the sutta and to miss the meaning which is not directing our attention to the precise forms of mind, but to the common understanding. It might be better to understand all these things (including also 'sati') as 'ways mind works'. Some people see it one way or are of predominantly one form of it, some another, some a mixture, but the point of this sutta is that however it is experienced the common denominator is that it changes rapidly. This is how I believe this matter should be seen: 'citta' is our 'heart' and means our mental center; mano is our 'mind' and has no discretely defined form or function or rather it has multiple meanings or serves as a unifying concept and can stand for the ordinary mind or the mind of the arahant; 'sati' is our 'memory' and is used as English 'mind' as in 'pay attention' and 'remember'; 'vinnana' is our 'consciousness' and is our knowing that we know and self-awareness. There are other terms as well that relate to functions we call 'mind': vimansa, investigation, vitakka and vicara, thinking, etc. All of these are the work of memory. What we consider the focus or center of our being is a consequence of the arising of memories; what we call our mind is a consequence of the piecing together of memories; what we call memory is the remembering of things; what we call paying attention is the remembering to notice what we are trying to remember to do. On top of the basic workings of memory, we apply views according to the use to which the memory is being put. When we want to remember how we feel about a thing we call it heart. When we want to think of ourselves as intelligent beings (man) we call it mind; when we want to use it to pay attention and recall things we call it memory; when we want to remember that we should stay awake when the Professor is speaking, we call it consciousness. They are all synonyms and they are not synonyms depending on the point you are trying to make.<br />

Then he describes how it is that consciousness arises through contact, sense-experience and perception and that it is by perceiving that that detachment leads to freedom and the knowledge of freedom.<br />

					Maha-Kotthita puts questions about the Paticca Samuppada to Sariputta. He frames his questions in the form of the four basic propositions about existence put into questions about whether or not the links in the Paticca Samuppada are created by the self or other or both or neither.<br />

					Venerable Savittha questions the Venerable Musila about whether or not apart from belief, inclination, hearsay, argument as to method, reflection on and approval of an opinion, he has, as his very own, the knowledge of the various steps of the Paticca Samuppada and of the knowledge that the ending of becoming is Nibbāna. In all cases he states that he has such knowldge. And when the Venerable Savittha declares him an arahant he remains silent. Then the Venerable Narada, who has overheard this dialogue asks that the same questions be asked of him and when asked he responds in the same way. But when Savittha pronounces him too an arahant, Narada explains that while he has personal knowledge of these things, he has not attained them. And he gives the simile of the thirsty man who comes across a well with no means to retrieve the water.<br />

					The Buddha likens the momentum of ignorance to the way the rise and fall of the sea-level influences the momentum of the flow of water in the great rivers, streams, lakes, and feeder streams.<br />
					There is a phenomena seen in rivers emptying into the ocean of a reverse of flow at flood-tide; but it effects the flow of the river for only a short distance back into the land and it's hard to think that there is any effect at all on the feeder streams or further back. It may happen at a certain very subtle level. I would read the Pali: 'A rise in the ocean impeeds access to it by the river, etc.'<br />

					Susima enters the order to learn the secret of Gotama's ability to generate respect and donatives. There he hears about bhikkhus gaining Arahantship and quesions them about super-normal powers. These bhikkhus tell him they have no super-normal powers and have been awakened through wisdom. Questioning the Buddha about this he learns to appreciate the Dhamma and confesses his earlier bad intentions.<br />
					Apart from the controversy as to whether or not this sutta is evidence that Arahantship can be gained without experience of jhana (it isn't; it doesn't raise the issue), this sutta has another difficult issue to deal with. The bhikkhus that have declared Arahantship <i>(Aññā)</i> have said they did so by way of Wisdom. The thing to note is that in response to being questioned by Susima about this, the Buddha asks him a series of questions which when complete imply the definition of the method of attaining arahantship by way of wisdom (knowing and seeing the Paticca Samuppada) along with the idea that knowledge and vision have arisen without attaining magic powers. We can see that that Susima knows and sees, but he has not declared Arahantship. Knowing and seeing are not the same thing as Arahantship. But Susima (and the reader) can, on knowing and seeing according to this method see that it does not necessarily involve these attainments.<br />

					Sariputta states that there is nothing in the world whatsoever that would cause him suffering even including the passing away of the Master.<br />
					For those who object to my translation of <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> as 'own-making' note the presence in this sutta of the terms <i>'ahiŋkāra'</i> and <i>'mamaŋkāra'</i>: 'I-making' and 'My-making.' If these, why not 'own-making'? The reason, of course is simply the weight of the tradition of past translations and academic authority over common sense.<br />

					The Buddha instructs the bhikkhus to develop serenity for seeing the origin and ending of form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness.<br />
					Note in my translation the use of 'counterpart' as a translation for <i>'paṭicca'</i> in an effort to get away from 'cause' and even 'condition'; the use of 'serenity' for <i>'samādhi'</i> in order to point to the fact that <i>samādhi</i> is more than just concentration; and the use of 'arising to self' for <i>'samudaya'</i> in an effort to point out the <i>'sam'</i> that never appears in the translation 'arising' or 'origin'. What the Buddha is always talking about is not the original creation of things, but the identified-with existence of things. Form has existence only in so far as it is experienced by an individual. That does not mean that the individual is creating form. It only means that the individual has created the experience of form. 'It is the diversity of data that results in the diversity of perceptions; it is not the diversity of perceptions that results in the diversity of data. <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.14.008.olds.bd.htm">SN 2.14.8 - olds</a><br />

					The Buddha points out that form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness were unstable in the past, will be unstable the future and are unstable in the present and that therefore the wise person practices to let these things go.<br />
					Note the order: Past, Future, Present. This is the order used throughout the suttas (in spite of some translations indicating otherwise). The reason is to be found in the understanding of the nature of mind to proceed according to instructions. Think of the way a search tool looks for what is saught as literally described. [First examine the past, then examine the future, then examine the present.] We do not want it dwelling in the past or anticipating the future, so we direct the mind to reflection on the way things were in the past, then the way things will be in the future, then set it down to reflect on the way things are in the present. Also note that there is no actual term in Pali for 'the present'. Here it is <i>Paccuppanna</i> 'that which confronts' or has risen up in our face, literally the 'percussively-uprisen'. Elsewhere it is <i>'diṭṭha-dhamma'</i> this 'seen thing'. The reason? Change is seen to make it impossible to locate any point in time that could be called a 'present moment'. Even in that which confronts us different objects are changing at different rates and further, by the nature of perception being consequent on contact giving rise to consciousness, all that which we understand to be 'the present' is really already in the past.<br />

						<h4 class="ctr">It Ends! It Ends!</h4>

						<p class="f4">Develop serenity and the appreciation of solitude, my friends —</p>

						<p class="f4">It is through developing serenity and the appreciation of solitude<br />
						that one comes to know things as they really are.</p>

						<p class="f4">What things?</p>

						<p class="f4">The arising in the appearance of self of form<br />
						and the ending of form;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of sense experience,<br />
						and the ending of sense experience;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of perception,<br />
						and the ending of perception,<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of own-making,<br />
						and the ending of own-making;<br />
						the arising in the appearance of self of consciousness,<br />
						and the ending of consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Taking pleasure in form one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in sense-experience one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in perception one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in own-making one is tied down,<br />
						taking pleasure in consciousness one is tied down.</p>

						<p class="f4">Regarding forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness as self,<br />
						or the self as having forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness,<br />
						or forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness as having self,<br />
						or self as being in forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness,<br />
						upon the alteration and change of forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness there is experience anxiety and fear.</p>

						<p class="f4">Taking pleasure or experiencing anxiety and fear concerning forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness,<br />
						one obsesses about forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness,<br />
						forms intentions with regard to forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Obsession and forming intentions are the fuel that drives existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">The counterpart of existence is birth.</p>

						<p class="f4">The counterpart of birth is aging and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery,<br />
						and despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">This was the case in the past,<br />
						this will be the case in the future,<br />
						and this is the case in what we see arising in front of us as self right now.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is what one sees in the serenity of solitude.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">Forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness are unstable.</p>

						<p class="f4">Being tied down to,<br />
						taking pleasure in,<br />
						experiencing anxiety and fear concerning<br />
						that which is unstable is the experience of pain.</p>

						<p class="f4">That which is painful is not wanted,<br />
						experience of that which is not wanted is something that is not under one's control.</p>

						<p class="f4">Something that is not under one's control<br />
						is not reasonably to be seen as:<br />
						"This is mine."<br />
						"I am this."<br />
						"This is my self."</p>

						<p class="f4">That on which forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness depend,<br />
						that which is the fuel which supports their existence,<br />
						the driving force of their existence,<br />
						is unstable, painful, and not-self.</p>

						<p class="f4">How could that which is dependent on,<br />
						fueled and supported by,<br />
						driven by,<br />
						the unstable, painful, and not-self<br />
						be stable, pleasant and self?</p>

						<p class="f4">Such a thing o b,<br />
						can no be.</p>

						<p class="f4">So seeing, one is repelled by forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Repelled one is not tied down to forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness;<br />
						one does not experience anxiety and fear at the instability of forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Not taking pleasure or experiencing anxiety and fear concerning forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness,<br />
						one does not obsess about forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness,<br />
						one does not form intentions with regard to forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making and consciousness.</p>

						<p class="f4">Not obsessing and forming intentions,<br />
						there is no fuel to drive existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">Without existence there is no birth.</p>

						<p class="f4">Without birth there is no aging and death,<br />
						grief and lamentation,<br />
						pain and misery<br />
						and despair.</p>

						<p class="f4">This is what one sees in the serenity of solitude.</p>

						<p class="f4">Develop serenity and the appreciation of solitude, my friends —</p>

						<p class="f4">It is through developing serenity and the appreciation of solitude<br />
						that one comes to know things as they really are.</p>

							<p class="lgqt">*<i>Mano.</i> There are numerous forms of 'mind', and the word can indicate the unidentified-with mind of the Arahant. Here the term is qualified by it's inclusion as a sense-sphere as being the mind of an identified-with, existing being.</p>

							<p class="lgqt">** Consciousness. Here this is just the fact of consciousness. Consciousness as a phenomena. Like 'Mind', there are many forms of consciousness, each depending on it's object. Consciousness does not arise without having an object of it's awareness. If consciousness arises in conjunction with consciousness of an unidentified-with (un own-made) named-form it is called 'the unseen consciousness) which is a term for the consciousness of the Arahant and is an equivalent of Nibbāna. Who made the un-identified-with named form? Someone else. This 'unidentified=with consciousness' arises with consciousness that the object is not own-made as it's object.</p>

							<p class="lgqt">† Own-making. In different words, an 'identified-with consciousness of existince as named-form' (i.e., an already existing conscious living being) acts with intent to create identified-with experience by bringing together in thought: consciousness, name and form. So we can say that 'named-form created consciousness' and 'consciousness created named-form'. Conceiving in mind a desired object and taking steps by way of thought, word and deed to obtain that object; that object being realized (being made up from named forms) there is consciousness arising from that situation.</p>

							<p class="lgqt">†† "is there no". This statement is absolute and relative. It would be that if there were 'no' anywhere there would be 'no' anywhere; but directed at the individual this means: "if you personally had no/did no". "If there were in you no" etc.</p>

								<p>Abstention from unskillful behavior (deeds causing harm to self or others); cultivation of self-control, done poorly, done moderately well, done in a superior way.</p>

								<p class="f4"><b>3. Made by Developing Self-Awakening with a wise objective as the result.</b></p>

								<p>Developing the mind, Dhamma research, energy, enthusiasm, impassivity, serenity, and detachment, done poorly, done moderately well, done in a superior way.</p>

								<p>Depending on the degree of development #s 1 and 2, practiced together, result in rebirths from luckless human birth through rebirth among the gods with power over the creations of others. See: <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#realms">A Map of the Mind,</a> for the Buddhist Cosmology.</p>

								<p>Generosity practiced by itself, though always productive of good results, does not necessarily affect birth. It can, for example, explain a bad man with good luck, or an animal, ghost, or daemon with powers or good luck.</p>

								<p>Rebirth in the company of Brahmā and above, and attainment of Nibbāna, all require developing the mind to one degree or another.</p>

								<p>Keep in mind that in Buddhist India the idea of 'superior' development of a thing was truly heroic in scope.</p>

					Eight essential factors in the observation of the Buddhist Sabbath with an explanation of why this practice is so fruitful.<br />
					Very interesting from the point of view of the comparative life-spans of some of the gods above the human realm. In this we have an anticipation by about 2500 years of Einstein's Theory of Relativity ... adding some things Einstein didn't think of. Combine this with an understanding that the Paticca Samuppada anticipates quantum physics and whole new worlds of possibilities open up ... But not so long as we have the seven-day work week throwing off the natural rhythm of life as would be lived according to lunar and solar time. In balance with the cosmos, one can see into the cosmos, find one's place, achieve balance; off balance, the sight of man is continually seeking just to find balance. We see the result of that in the focus on the buck. Organize the calendar according to the convenience of the merchant in the seven-day work-week and the mind naturally concludes that the goal of the merchant (the buck) is the source of balance in the world. Think of the ramifications in terms of health, status, power, satisfaction. I suggest that the powers that be when the world grinds to a halt (some time after the election) from the utter bordom of this meaningless pursuit, that in stead of instigating a new war to liven things up, they change the calendar.<br />

					The term to understand here is <i>hat'upanisa.</i> <i>Hata:</i> struck, destroyed. <i>Upanisa</i> (which I take to be from <i>Upanisīdati</i> which lead to <i>Upanissaya</i> (basis, support, foundation)): to set up seated upon. Not 'cause'. So: 'The seating for lack of regret is struck down by lack of ethical conduct. etc.' It is not just that with lack of ethical conduct there is no basis [or 'cause'] for non-regret; lack of ethical conduct actually destroys the basis for non-regret. A person of poor ethical conduct is not just missing out on the benefits of good conduct, he is actively working against his best interests. One is never just passively letting things slide. Poor ethical behavior is a matter of choice. It is not more work to make ethical choices. In fact, since most ethical choices in this system involve abstention from choosing a wrong course, it is much easier to behave ethically. The wording is a matter of the life or urgency of the sutta.<br />

Her difficulty stems from her not having thoroughly worked out in her mind the notion of what 'existence' meant in this system: that is that it is, in precisely the way it is stated in one version of Quantum Physics, only upon experience by an individual that a thing comes into existence. Again: the concept of existence is limited to that which is experienced by the individual as an individual. Without the notion of individuality, perception exists. This, by the way is something that I have not heard explained by the Quantum Physicists, that is how it comes to be that a thing is perceived by an individual and by that brought into existence without there being a prior perception of that thing. The eye comes into contact with a visible object and visual consciousness arises. For that to become an individualized experience of seeing, that visual-consciousness must be perceived by an already identified-with mind. (We don't ask where that first identified-with mind came from. Not even Buddhas perceive that. But if we push for some sort of explanation of it's origin it is explained as a function of thirst, desire. Mind, perceiving pleasant objects, experiences sensation and desire to repeat that sensation arises. For it to be experienced by the mind with the desire, some sort of identification (location in Time and Space) of the mind that is to experience the experience must be made. How about we call it: "Me" and say that the experience from that perspective is the experience of an "I", or is "My experience." Oops! How do I get out of here?!!<br />

					Some bhikkhus are asked that since both they and the Buddha teach a goal of understanding all things, what is the difference between the two systems. The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that when this question is asked the response should be: 'The 10 Questions." (Giving them in full as found in this sutta)<br />
					This is a subtle response to this question in that The 10 Questions is a broad and deep exposition to the 10th power of how everything in the world is to be let go. Each of 'the 10' is a complete path to utter detachment seen from a different perspective. A sutta no serious student of the Dhamma should neglect!

							<p>Note: "largely" means does this thing occur very frequently in me? Is it a 'big thing' <i>'bahula'.</i> Woodward: 'Live generally'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'often'. Bhk. Thanissaro omits the qualification. The qualification is important because a single occurance, or a rare occurance of these things is much less of a problem with regard to the bad things and much more of a problem with regard to the good things. Also, stating the case in the form 'do I or do I not' does not put the proper emphasis on the knowledge of the self of both the positive and negative.</p>

					The Buddha gives two criteria for evaluating the knowledge of one's own heart: attainment of higher wisdom and insight into Dhamma, and calm of heart; and then he gives a method for judging the right course to take with regard to clothing, food, location and persons.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi has translated <i>'Samatha'</i> as 'serenity'; Woodward uses 'peace'; Bhk. Thanissaro uses 'tranquility. <i>'Samatha'</i> is a term that both encompasses and is subordinate to <i>'samādhi'</i>. It stands for the general goal of the calm necessary for unbiased vision of things the way they really are, and it is the practice of stilling, calming and tranquilizing the body in preparation for samādhi. What is required for this word then, is one that implies the general idea of calm (applicable to both body and mind, or as here, heart), plus the specific idea of calm of body. 'Serenity' is more of a mental quality. It is the idea of being calmly above it all. Therefore I suggest that for <i>'samatha'</i> we use 'calm' or 'tranquility'; and reserve 'serenity' for <i>'samādhi.'</i><br />

In this sutta is a case of 'curing' by way of hearing the Dhamma. Also in this sutta is found a version of what would later become the Satipatthana method.<br />
					In this sutta Bhk. Bodhi translates 'sankhara' both as 'conditioned phenomena' and as 'activities'. The first is simply incorrect (all own-made phenomena are impermanent, but not all conditioned phenomena are impermanent: Nibbāna is conditioned), the second is one-sided and too narrow, the two together are confusing.

					I suggest reading the introduction to my translation of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/10_tens/an10.208.olds.bd.htm">#208</a> to understand the problems with translation of this sutta, namely that as translated the Buddha is saying that there is no ending kamma without experiencing the consequences of all previously done deeds which is impossible. ... Well, it is possible, twisting one's understanding of what 'experiencing' means. I have explained this elsewhere as being a matter of the degree of effort made to liberate oneself being such as to alter the nature of the consequences so that all consequences get jamed into what remains of one's lifespan and is experienced more mentally than in any other way. But my explanation in #208 uses a different translation of the term being translated 'experiencing' and makes the same case in simpler terms.<br />

					There are some interesting traces of old thoughts to be found in the background story for the verses of this Thera: that the 3 Piṭakas existed prior to the first council; (of course a 'basket' is not the same thing as what is contained in the basket); that at least some believed that the 3 Piṭakas exist as a sort of cosmic force that is recollected by each succeeding Buddha; that for the most part bhikkhus at the time specialized in one or another branch of Dhamma study: Dhamma or Vinaya, or what is called "Abhidhamma" with a capital "A" but which more likely ought to be referring to "abhidhamma" meaning the study of actual practice, especially in the cultivation of the jhanas, release, and the super-normal powers, in which case calling it a 'basket' would indicate that such was not so much a collection of stories about specific occurrances as a collection of ideas. (The Patimokkha vs. the Sutta Vibhanga; the Anguttara and Samyutta Nikayas -- with some exceptions -- vs the Majjhima and Digha Nikayas) Given this latter understanding the idea of the pitakas existing throughout time becomes more reasonable: A Buddha, his two main disciples,  and the main and corrolary ideas relative to awakening and to the ethical conduct of one who follows the Dhamma would all be cosmic principles which resurface periodically at various points in the evolutions of the world.<br />

Bodhi and Woodward translations (notes are missing from the Bhk. Bodhi versions permitted to be published on line)) concerning the use of the future tense in Dona's inquiries. Bhk. Thanissaro's solution here is that this is a manner of speech. I would only express it slightly differently as a contracted form of: "Will you be being about being a ..." From the perspective of the awakened mind there is actually no true 'present' to base a present tense upon in the case of asking a person what he is in the present. Things are under constant change, so a being is always about becoming something. There should really be a special tense for this case: The present-future or the future-present.<br />

					The Buddha explains how when faith, sense of shame, fear-of-blame, energy and wisdom are established as instinctive responses, unskillful states find it impossible to gain access.<br />
					The word to understand here is <i>paccupaṭṭhitā.</i> PED: <i>Paccupaṭṭhita [pp. of paccupaṭṭhahati; [paṭi+upa+sthā]</i> "to stand up before," to be present;] (re)presented, offered, at one's disposal, imminent, ready, present. I would say rather to have at one's disposal (uprising, <i>upa</i>) the reflex <i>(paṭi)</i> previously established <i>(sthā, stood up)</i> of ... In other words at the first appearance of danger faith etc. reflexively also appears: what we call an 'instinctive response' or 'muscle response' a habitual response recollected more by the musclulature than through thought processes. Hare: "is set on"; Bhk. Bodhi: "is securely settled in."<br />
					The point is to give assurance that one has not fallen off track simply because one is harassed in mind by unskillful things; as long as the skills of faith, etc. have been thoroughly ingrained in one's thought processes they will come forward and the skillful will prevail.<br />

					The Buddha likens a person mastered by wishing for sense pleasure, hate, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling, and doubt and vacillation (the Nivaranas — diversions) to a stream which has been diverted and no longer has it's original strength or free will. Then he likens a person who has mastered desire for sense pleasures, hatred, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling and doubt and vacillation to a stream whose diversions have been closed off and which has regained its strength and free will.<br />
					The Pali word to understand here is <i>Nīvaraṇa:</i> 'Diversion', not 'obstruction' or 'obstacle, or check. The psychology is completely different when dealing with an obsticle or obstruction or check than it is when dealing with a diversion. An obstacle, etc. stops one's forward motion until the obstacle is eliminated; a diversion weakens but does not arrest completely the forward motion. The simile is of a diversion, not of an obstruction. Words are very important. You must see yourself as if in a stream. The hippies said "Go with the flow". The Buddhist says: "Escape the flow". The Buddhist does not say: "Try to stop the flow," or "Try to stop flowing within the flow."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddhist idea of the stream is two-sided. On the one hand it symbolizes the flow of the world; on the other hand it symbolizes the flow of one who has latched on to the idea of escaping the worldly stream. First one must recognize the worldly stream and it's dangers, then one can understand the value of making the effort to escape. That is the meaning of Stream-entry. The ability to see that everything, including oneself is in constant motion, flow, and that one has taken a portion of that flow and identified with it and that if that identification is not broken, that flow will take one on endlessly against one's will. The stream flows into the river, the river into the ocean the ocean evaporates into the clouds and falls back to earth again as the rain which flows down the mountain into the stream. It is constantly ending and reviving. Lust is a diversion from the task of escaping identification with the flow. If one considers lust, etc. to be an obstruction to escape, it conduces to despair because it is felt that there is no progress at all in other areas as long as one has any lust remaining at all. And this is not the case. Progress is gradual. It is a progressive diminution of lust, etc. Progress, escape, liberation, freedom is pleasurable, enjoyable. Something that is desired once it is seen in even a small way. When lust, etc. is seen to slow down that progress, to divert one's energy from effort to enlarge that enjoyment, it is seen as something to be got rid of for the sake of that higher enjoyment.<br />

					<p class="f4">"Truly, now," said Michael Mail, clearing the corner of his throat in the manner of a man who meant to be convincing; "there's a friendly tie of some sort between music and eating." He lifted the cup to his mouth, and drank himself gradually backwards from a perpendicular position to a slanting one, during which time his looks performed a circuit from the wall opposite him to the ceiling overhead. Then clearing the other corner of his throat: "Once I was sitting in the little kitchen of the Three Choughs at Casterbridge, having a bit of dinner, and a brass band struck up in the street. Sich a beautiful band as that were! I was sitting eating fried liver and lights, I well can mind - ah, I was I and to save my life, I couldn't help chawing to the tune. Band played six-eight time; six-eight chaws I, willy-nilly. Band plays common; common time went my teeth among the fried liver and lights as true as a hair. Beautiful 'twere! Ah, I shall never forget that there band!"</p>

					To give another example of the use of 'mind' as 'remember'. So we justify using 'mind' as the translation throughout for 'sati', whether the intent is to be saying: 'the mind', 'remember', 'pay attention', or 'look after.' It makes no never-mind that this usage has fallen out of the common memory. We can recollect it. - 'lights' = lung - O.E.D.</p>

					Sangarava approaches Gotama with the idea that those who perform sacrifices do more good for more people than those who leave the household life for the homeless state. Gotama then raises the case of a Buddha arising in the world, one who teaches multitudes, gods and men. There follows discussion of the merits of various magic powers.<br />

					Woodward notes that the Pali word used for the title of this sutta, <i>'cara'</i> means 'walking' but he is then forced to say that this includes all the postures. PED: "[from <i>car, carati</i>] 1. the act of going about, walking; one who walks or lives." We say 'carries on'. This is 'carriage' the manner in which one carries oneself ... whether walking, or standing still, or sitting or lying down ... or acting with mind and speech. The term has wide use and is worth remembering. It has come down even to us in our: 'carriage' (both the vehicle and the way one carries oneself) 'cart' 'car' 'carry'.<br />

Do not confuse with either <i>vimutti</i> or <i>vimokkha.</i> 'Release' really doesn't work here. PED has: "<i>Vossagga:</i> relinquishing, relaxation; handing over, donation, gift".

					The Buddha lists the Four major chiefs of beings in the world.<br />
					Both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translate the individuals in the list in this sutta as being spoken of in the present tense. This creates a small problem when it comes to Mandhata. In <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.2/jat.2.258.rous.pts.htm">the Jataka story,</a> Mandhata is identified with The Buddha. So from these two sources of information, as translated, we are told: Gotama is his own early ancestor. (Not a problem given the nature of rebirth.) Gotama was two of the pre-eminant beings he is describing. (Somewhat of a problem as they are incompatible, for this would be telling us that The Buddha (as Tathāgata) is one who possesses or enjoys sense-pleasures. when it is clearly stated in numerous places that one does not speak of the 'Tathāgata' in this way.)  But if Gotama is not to be identified with Mandhata, how can Mandhata be being spoken of in the present tense as the mythical Mandhata is long dead?<br />
					Trying to resolve this problem if we conclude that the Jataka story, as a story of a previous life of the Buddha is a later invention, but that the story of Mandhata was likely one well known to at least the Sakyans, we are left thinking that the mention of Mandhata in the present tense in this sutta is hardly a useful example of what it means to be supreme in the enjoyment or possession of sense-pleasures as we know 1. that he is dead, and 2. we know nothing about his current location or experiences. Either we have here a case where the teaching of the Buddha is not well done, or that this is not a true sutta given by the Buddha, or we have to conclude that the Jataka story is a true story of one of the Buddha's former lives and that the point of using Mandhata as an example was to create this question in our minds and force us to see that Gotama and Mandhata were one and the same individuality and that this is a way for the Buddha to tell the bhikkhus that a Tathāgata enjoys sense-pleasures. (Just a little too twisted even in my view of Gotama's subtlety, and still amounting to a view rejected by the Buddha.) I suggest a different construction:<br />
					<i>etad aggaɱ bhikkhave kāmabhogīnaɱ yad idaɱ rājā Mandhātā;</i><br />
					At the top, beggars, that is to say of sense-pleasure possessors/enjoyers: King Mandhata.<br />
					'At the top' meaning 'at the all-time top'.<br />

					A detailed discussion of the five fetters to lower rebirths and the practice by way of which these five fetters are eliminated so as to result in non-returning.<br />
					This sutta is incomprehensable in any of the translations we have. See the discussion: <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/fetters.htm#fn5">'The Five Fetters to the Lower Rebirths'</a> for an analysis of why this is the case. In brief: The Buddha objects to Malunkayaputta's statement that he has taught that x,y, and z are yokes to rebirth because what he has taught is that it is obsession with x,y, and z that is the yoke, not the x,y, and z itself.<br />
					In the second part of this sutta the Buddha describes five paths to either arahantship or by the abandoning of the five yokes to rebirth (remember: <i>obsession</i> with views of own-body, etc.,), non-returning: the first burning-knowledge <i>(jhāna),</i> the second, the third, the fourth, the realm of limitless space, the realm of limitless consciousness and the realm of nothing's-to-be-had, each, if accompanied by the perception that the khandhas are painful and not-self, and if one turns his mind from those things and dwells in stead on the deathless thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">(In the abridged Chalmers and Bhk. Bodhi translations it is easy to read this as being one path, but it is five discrete paths — for a clearer picture of what is being said read the fully expanded Horner translation.)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, at this point Ānanda asks: "This being the Way, this being the walk to walk to the abandoning of the yokes to rebirth, how is it that some persons are heart-freed <i>(ceto-vimutti)</i> and some are wisdom-freed <i>(paññā-vimutti)</i>?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda's question arises from the fact that each path terminates in the same insight and thought (as above); and that being the case, how is it possible that it could result in two sorts of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha's response is that this is a result of differences in forces <i>(indriya-vemattata)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ms. Horner quotes commentary as follows (Bhk. Bodhi paraphrases in a footnote): [I have inserted the underlying pali in square brackets; Bhk. Bodhi's translation in parenthesis:]</p>

					      <p class="f2 in2">MA. iii. 147-8; If when a monk goes after calm [<i>samatha = samādhi</i>] (Bhk. Bodhi: serenity), one-pointedness of mind [<i>cetaso ekodi-bhāvaɱ</i>](B.B.: unification of mind) is to the forefront - this monk is called freed in mind [<i>ceto-vimutti</i>](BB: deliverance of mind); but if wisdom [<i>paññā</i>] is to the forefront - such a monk is called freed through wisdom [<i>paññā-vimutti</i>]. When one goes after insight [<i>vipassana</i>], if wisdom is to the forefront, such a monk is called freed through wisdom; if his one-pointedness of mind is to the forefront, he is called freed in mind. The two chief disciples attained arahantship with calm and insight to the forefront; Sāriputta was freed through wisdom and Moggallāna was freed in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say that what all this is saying is that of the multiple Ways and Walks to Walk to the one end result, there are two prominant interdependent modes of approach: by way of calm and serenity (<i>samatha and samādhi</i>) and by way of insight (<i>vipassana</i>). Both are necessary but emphasis is placed on one or another of these forces by different personality types.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within each of the two modes there are two further sub-forces (really just echos of their opposite number) at work: intent to gain focus (or whole-hearted single-mindedness or to become 'centered')(<i>cetaso ekodi-bhāvaɱ</i>)(which is really just another term for <i>samādhi</i>); and intent to gain wisdom (<i>paññā</i>)(which is really just another way of speaking about <i>vipassana</i>).</p>

					<p class="f4">'Heart' or 'Whole-hearted single mindedness' here is single-minded focus on the attaining of liberation without necessarily understanding the various mechanisms by which that liberation is attained (you must, at least, have knowledge of the meaning of freedom in the Buddha's Dhamma). You sit down to get freedom and you know if you are free and you know if you are not free and you intend to get free period. Intent on wisdom is the intent to attain freedom through the understanding of each step of the way. Wisdom is the ability to use that understanding both to advance the self and advance others of similar inclination. Some persons are more inclined one way others the other way, some both ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are (back to describing what the commentary is saying) the different forces that in different combinations result in either heart-freedom or wisdom-freedom or freedom-both-ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <i>samatha and samādhi</i> --&gt; <i>cetaso ekodi-bhāvaɱ</i> --&gt; <i>ceto-vimutti</i>;<br />
					2. <i>samatha and samādhi</i> --&gt; <i>paññā</i> --&gt; <i>paññā-vimutti</i><br />
					3. <i>vipassana</i> --&gt; <i>cetaso ekodi-bhāvaɱ</i> --&gt; <i>ceto-vimutti</i>;<br />
					4. <i>vipassana</i> --&gt; <i>paññā</i> --&gt; <i>paññā-vimutti</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I question the need to introduce <i>samatha</i> and <i>vipassana</i> except as a means of staking out territory. <i>Vipassana</i> is not listed among the forces (<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>indriana;</i></a>) <i>samādhi</i> and <i>paññā</i> are. If one understood that <i>cetaso ekodi-bhāvaɱ</i>  could be classed as equivalent to <i>samādhi = samatha</i> (see <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">MN 44</a>) and <i>paññā</i> as <i>vipassana</i> we could have checked the list and not have had the complication of information not provided by the Buddha in the sutta. As explanation it could all have been said by saying that if in your approach to awakening you emphasize the direct attaining of freedom of heart through <i>samādhi,</i> you will end up heart-freed; if you emphasize the acquisition of wisdom through insight you will end up wisdom-freed, if you balance both or follow one with the other, you end up freed-both-ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is interesting to note how the Chalmers translation (here and elsewhere) shows us the powerful influence of first translations on those that follow.</p>

					Two bhikkhus are taken to task for disparaging the rule about eating at impropper times. Includes a description of Seven sorts of Persons pointing out which have nothing more to do and which have something more to do.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<div class="inner">

							<h4 class="ctr">Seven Persons</h4>

							<p class="f4">The Both-ways freed<br />
							The Wisdom-freed<br />
							The Body-knower,<br />
							The View-secured,<br />
							The Faith-freed,<br />
							The Dhamma-follower,<br />
							The Faith-follower.</p>

									<p class="f2 in2">'Freed' in this set means not necessarily that such a one is freed, but that such a one is working at being freed in this way. It might be better to understand this in the sense of 'freed or partially freed'.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>The Both-ways freed:</b> One who has attained arahantship by having both attained in body <i>The Eight Releases</i> [see below <a href="#releases">'releases'</a>] and who has also seen with wisdom that he has destroyed the Corrupting Influences [<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm">Āsavas</a>].</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has nothing more to do in that he has secured unshakable freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>The Wisdom-freed:</b> One who has attained arahantship only having seen with wisdom that he has destroyed the Corrupting Influences [<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm">Āsavas</a>].</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has nothing more to do in that he has secured unshakable freedom.</p>

							      <p class="f4 in2">The distinction here is between freedom attained through experience of having trained with the body  — the individual who sits down to attain freedom without necessarily understanding the details for attaining such, so that it is said that 'his body knows' — and freedom attained by having destroyed the corrupting influences by way of insight gained working through knowledge and seeing things as they really are. Today [Sunday, April 24, 2016 6:39 AM] modern science recognizes something called "muscle-memory". Having performed an action enough times it becomes such as can be performed almost without use of conscious thought. If this is not the same thing it is closely related.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>Body-knower</b> [aka: witness; Ms. Horner 'mental realizer' (which translation is inexplicable)] One who has attained temporary release through experience of having attained in body <i>The Eight Releases,</i> but who has not yet completely destroyed the Corrupting Influences.</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has more to do in that he has not yet secured unshakable freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>The View-secured:</b> One who is essentially on the same path as the Wisdom-freed, but whose wisdom has got only as far as a comprehension of <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_saccani.htm">The Four Truths</a> and who has by this much partly destroyed the Corrupting Influences.</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has more to do in that he has not yet secured unshakable freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>The Faith-freed:</b> One who has faith that the Buddha was an Arahant, a fully self-awakened one, one who got what was to be got, a seer of this world and the worlds beyond, who understood the way to the End of Pain and whose teaching of that way was consummately done, and who also by this faith has partly destroyed the Corrupting Influences.</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has more to do in that he has not yet secured unshakable freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>Dhamma-follower:</b> One who is able to see that the Corrupting Influences are not destroyed in him; in whose wisdom there is moderate approval of the Buddha's Dhamma; and in whom there are the forces of faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom.</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has more to do in that he has not yet secured unshakable freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4"><b>Faith-follwer:</b> One who is able to see that the Corrupting Influences are not destroyed in him; but who has sufficient faith and respect for the Buddha; and in whom there are the forces of faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom.</p>

							<p class="f4">This individual has more to do in that he has not yet secured unshakable freedom.</p>

					Vacchagotta is given a lesson in brief concerning what is skillful and what is not skillful and becomes a bhikkhu. Having mastered what is necessary as a foundation he is told to master calm and insight in order to attain magic powers, recollection of past lives, knowledge of the outcome of deeds, and the destruction of the Asavas.

								<p class="f4">The issues raised come up now and again. The Arahant does not agree with points of view that are expressed, nor does he negate them. This is expressed in other cases as 'neither collaborating with nor rebelling against'. He does not 'confront' in debate or in any other form of behavior. He sees things as they are, without intervening 'interpretation' and so when himself confronted by the expression of a viewpoint he does not respond directly, but responds with a statement of what he actually sees. And the corollary (in response to the challenge that by using terms such as "I" and "mine" in common speech he (the arahant) is expressing a point of view): In ordinary speech the Arahant uses the words 'I', 'My' etc., without attaching any idea of ownership.</p>

					<p><b>On Style:</b> After having thoroughly purged almost all the translations of their references to Pali pages, I have seen the value of these references and will begin to restore them as I go along. They will have the following appearance: <a id="pt348" href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg348"><span class="f2">[348]</span></a> and will be links to the PTS Pali Text Page number as located on this site's BJT/PTS hybrid Pali Text. These links can themselves be linked to by appending "#pt000" (without the quotation marks; zeros do not precede single or double digit numbers) to the url.<br />
					Along these same lines, I can see at some point a future generation editor adding/restoring the alternative readings and the page numbers of other versions of the Pali. At this point, for the following reasons, I have not included/kept these items: 1. Alternate readings are 99% irrelevant to the understanding of the doctrine (occasionally they are significant, but on these occasions they will almost certainly have been noted in footnotes); 2. are needlessly confusing; 3. would take more time than seems reasonable to me considering their utility; 4. page numbers to Pali texts that are not readily available are a time consuming luxory.<br />
					While we're at it, let's add to this list the insertion of the various corrections found in errata sheets, footnotes, and on errata pages at the end of some of the books.</p>

					Sitting there he finds himself in a very peaceful state of mind which he describes in a formula that later becomes know as 'the First <i>Jhāna</i>' — 'knowing'; it is a point at which two things are seen with absolute clarity: 1. it is got by letting go of (separating from) lesser states; and 2. it is a higher form of happiness than sense pleasure; that is at this point one knows for certain one is on the right track.</p>

					The well-known sutta in which the Buddha explains the idea that consciousness is a conditioned phenomena and is not the self that transmigrates from one birth to the next.<br />
					This is a very important sutta to understand clearly. (The Chalmers translation is too abridged to be of much help, see the other translations for a better perspective.)<br />
					All consciousness is a result of the coming together of conditions.<br />
					There are various sorts of consciousness depending on the conditions which give rise to it.<br />
					Consciousness is not a self that transmigrates from one existence to the next.<br />
					The subjective aparent continuity of individuality from moment to moment and life to life is a matter of illusion. A case of mistaken identity: Identification with conscousness assumed to be the continuation of an identification with consciousness that performed deeds with the intent of creating this consciousness.<br />
					After determining that it is individualized consciousness (among the various sorts of consciousness) that Sati believes transmigrates from birth to birth, the Buddha deals with that form of consciousness from the point of view of the factors on which it is dependent and the mechanism of rebirth itself. The mechanics of the arising of consciousness in ordinary rebirth must be understood before it can be seen how there arises a second sort of consciousness that is not dependent on individualized existence.<br />
					There are then two <i>general</i> categories of consciousness: Consciousness conditioned by things of Time; and consciousness conditioned by things not of Time.<br />
					Consciousness conditioned by things of time (the six senses) is a thing of time and comes to an end.<br />
					This is the consciousness of the ordinary individual.<br />
					When consciousness is conditioned by consciousness of freedom from things of time, it is consciousness conditioned by things not of time.<br />
					That consciousness, though it is conditioned, has not been own-made, identified-with, and is not an 'existing thing' but is only a consciousness of not being a thing, is not identified-with as "I" or "mine", and because not dependent on something that comes to an end, does not itself come to an end and is the goal of this system.<br />
					Again: Consciousness arises dependedent on conditions.<br />
					If the conditions present are consciousness of freedom from things of Time, the resulting consciousness is consciousness of consciousness of things not of Time. It has arisen as a result of conditons, not as a result of the willing of an individual (i.e., own-making, or sankharaming.) Consciousness, freed from things of time, is unlimited, not bound to Time, deathless... Nirvana: Out of the Woods; Nibbāna, unbound.<br />
					Returning to the sutta: An individual who sees consciousness like this does not speculate about the past, future or present nature of a self. He may have vision of past lives, but he also sees that none of them were the self of him. He knows of the future that there is no thing which will be identified with as the self. He knows of the present that there is no thing there that is the self. This is a simpler way of seeing things than the divisions that are created by the assumption of individuality and consequently he is not confused about things of the past, future or present. Things come to be as a consequence of conditions (kamma); without conditions they do not come to be; on the ending of the conditions that brought them about, they cease to be. For all things. Not just "me" or "them".<br />
					If you can see how ordinary rebirth-consciousness arises as a consequence of conditions, you can then see how with different conditions (consciousness of consciousness of things not of Time) a different sort of consciousness can arise and you can direct 'mind' to that second sort of consciousness which, unending, deathless, and free from time is clearly superior.<br />

					The Buddha explains the unreasonableness of such superficial practices as the wearing of robes, going naked, living in filth, ceremonial bathing, living at the root of a tree, eating according to a set regimin, chanting, or wearing matted hair in the hope of ridding one's self of malevolence, wrath, grudge-bearing, hypocrisy, spite, jealousy, stingyness, treachery, craftyness, evil desires and wrong views.

							<div class="inner">

							<p class="f4">Subjective existence, what is considered the individuality <i>(sakkāya)</i>, is that which is identified with and made up from the five support piles <i>pañca upādānakkhandhā</i>.</p>

							<p class="f4">The five support piles:</p>

							<p class="f4">The form support pile <i>(rūp'upādānakkhandhā)</i>;<br />
							the sensation support pile<i>(vedan'upādānakkhandhā)</i>;<br />
							the perception support pile<i>(saññ'upādānakkhandhā)</i>;<br />
							the own-making support pile<i>(saŋkhār'upādānakkhandhā)</i>; and<br />
							the consciousness support pile<i>(viññāṇ'upādānakkhandhā)</i>.</p>

							<p class="f4">The arising of individuality is a consequence of thirst <i>(taṇhā) — </i><br />
							thirst for this and that,<br />
							thirst for sensual pleasure,<br />
							thirst for existence,<br />
							thirst for increased existence,<br />
							accompanied by delight,<br />
							results in attachment<br />
							that leads on to rebirth.</p>

							<p class="f4">To bring about the end of individuality,<br />
							end the thirst.</p>

							<p class="f4">The walk to walk to bring about the end of thirst is:</p>

							<p class="f4">High Working Hypothesis,<br />
							High Principles,<br />
							High Talk,<br />
							High Works,<br />
							High Lifestyle,<br />
							High Self-control,<br />
							High Mind,<br />

							High Vision, and<br />
							High Detachment.<br />
							(see: <a href="../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">The Method</a> for details.)</p>

							<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="f4">That which is support for individuaity arises from the five support piles and<br />
							there is no support for individuality apart from the five support piles.</p>

							<p class="f4">The five support piles are not the support itself,<br />
							but the support does not exist without the five support piles;
							it is the wanting and lust arising from the five support piles that is the support for individuality.</p>

							<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="f4">The idea of individuality arises as a consequence of seeing beyond what is self-seen holding the views:</p>

							<p class="f4">Shape is the self<br />
							the self has shape,<br />
							shape is in the self,<br />
							self is in shape.</p>

							<p class="f4">Sensation is the self<br />
							the self has sensation,<br />
							sensation is in the self,<br />
							self is in sensation.</p>

							<p class="f4">Perception is the self<br />

							<p class="f4">The own-made is the self<br />
							the self has the own-made,<br />
							the own-made is in the self,<br />
							self is in the own-made.</p>

							<p class="f4">Consciousness is the self<br />
							the self has consciousness,<br />
							consciousness is in the self,<br />
							self is in consciousness.</p>

							<p class="f4">The idea of individuality is got rid of by:</p>

							<p class="f4">Not regarding shape as the self<br />
							or the self as having shape,<br />
							or shape as in the self,<br />
							or self as in shape.</p>

							<p class="f4">Not seeing sensation as the self<br />
							or the self as having sensation,<br />
							or sensation as in the self,<br />
							or self as in sensation.</p>

							<p class="f4">Not seeing perception as the self<br />
							or the self as having perception,<br />
							or perception as in the self,<br />
							or perception as in shape.</p>

							<p class="f4">Not seeing the own-made as the self<br />
							or the self as having the own-made,<br />
							or the own-made as in the self,<br />
							or self as in the own-made.</p>

							<p class="f4">Not seeing consciousness as the self<br />
							or the self as having consciousness,<br />

							<p class="f4">The Aristocratic Multi-Dimensional High Way, that is, High Working Hypothesis, High Principles, High Talk, High Works, High Lifestyle,<br />
							High Self-control, High Mind, High Serenity, High Vision, and High Detachment,<br />
							is own-made or constructed,<br />
							not not own-made.</p>

							<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="f4">There are three own-makings <i>(saŋkhāra):</i></p>

							<p class="f4">Own-made body;<br />
							own-made speech;<br />
							own-made heart (willing, intention).</p>

							<p class="f4">The broadest generalized way of speaking of the own-made body is to call it respiration;<br />
							respiration is bodily, and<br />
							the body is tied up in respiration.<br />
							(This definition accommodates other forms of body than are generally familiar, such as those who have multiple shapes but a single mind.)</p>

							<p class="f4">Own-made speech is essntially thinking and pondering;<br />
							first one thinks and ponders,<br />
							then one utters speech.</p>

							<p class="f4">The own-made locus of focus is essentially perceiving and experiencing the senses<br />
							perceiving and experiencing the senses are the heart of the matter (are central to),<br />
							and the heart is tied up in perceiving and experiencing.</p>

							<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

							<p class="f4">Serenity (<i>samādhi</i> = 'even-over'; here is where the term 'equanimity' even-mindedness, imperturbability should be being used as opposed to using it for <i>upekkha,</i> detachment) is the state of having become whole-heartedly single-minded <i>(cittassa ekaggatā)</i>. This definition encompases the entire practice, from undertaking generosity to the attainment of the ending of perception of sense-experience.</p>

							<p class="f4">The signs of serenity are having set up<br />
							minding the body,<br />
							minding sense experience,<br />
							minding states of the heart,<br />
							minding Dhamma.</p>

							<p class="f4">The pre-requisites for serenity are the four consummate efforts:</p>

							<p class="f4">The effort to get rid of unskillful states that have arisen;<br />
							the effort to keep off unskillful states that have not yet arisen;<br />
							the effort to aquire skillful states that have not yet arisen; and,<br />
							the effort to preserve skillful states that have arisen.</p>

							<p class="f4">This is the way Serenity is said to be being cultivated.</p>

							<p class="f4">The culmination of Serenity is the knowledge and wisdom attained in the freedom of deliverance from things of Time. Serenity being a state of mind of an individual, beyond that, the freedom of deliverance from things not of time is not counted as serenity.</p>

							<p class="f4">Here first own-making of body ceases first,<br />
							then own-making of speech,<br />
							then own-making of heart (perception and experience of sense).</p>

							<p class="f4">This state is reached by way of conditioning the mind, not by the intent to attain. There is in attaining this state no thought "I am attaining".</p>

							<p class="f4">The difference between this state and the state of a dead body is that there is here the remaining lifespan to be lived out and there is caloric energy.</p>

							<p class="f4">In re-entering serenity from the point where there is the freedom of delivery from where perception of sense experience ends, one enters signlessness, aimlessness, and emptiness, where here signs are signs of lust, anger and blindness; aims are towards things involving lust, anger, and blindness; and emptiness is a state empty of lust, anger, and blindness.</p>

							<p class="f4">Here first own-making of heart (perception and experience of sense) is revived,<br />
							then own-making of speech,<br />
							then own-making of body.</p>

The gatha at the end is about as close to an old-time curse as is found in Buddhism. (But note that Moggallāna clearly shows how this is not a curse, that he holds no ill-will, and that it is strictly this Mara's own deed that will bring about the dread consequences. In fact what we may be seeing here is the way the curse originated, that is as a simple statement of what a real seer sees as the consequences to someone of what they have done.

					The Buddha, from a brief discussion of the four types of individuals found in the world, when asked to elaborate expounds on the habits of those intent on harmful ascetic practices, those who follow a bloody calling, those who torment both themselves and others, and those who neither torment themselves nor torment others. By way of the last group he teaches a detailed course of progress from layman to the benefits of Arahantship.<br />

					In this sutta Ānanda explains to a householder how Arahantship can be attained via any single one of eleven different avenues. It is important to note that here is an unequivocal statement that it is possible to attain Arahantship directly from the First Jhana. I stress this point to the readers here not to make out that it is any easy task, but only to refute the notion that it is an impossible one, or that it is absolutely necessary to attain all Four Jhanas which is to make the task appear to be absolutely out of reach for most people today. To attain the First Jhana one must abandon all desire for sensual pleasures, give up foolish conduct, and become entheusiastic about the enjoyment of solitude. Most people can do this much. It requires a little effort. You need to find some place where you can be alone and undisturbed for several hours. Then remember: The Jhanas are not the goal, they are just the platform. At this point one must see the impermanance of all things that have been constructed to form one's individual world including this very mental state called the Jhana, any body, sensation, perception, personal construction, and individualized consciousness. Then one must see that this impermanance, for one attached to the world, inevitably brings pain, and that what is painful cannot be the self. So seeing, one is repelled by constructed things, repelled one abandons them and constructs no more, having abandoned construction one is free, in freedom, seeing freedom, one can know: rebirth is left behind (it requires construction), lived is the best of lives, duty's duty has been done and there is no more being any kind of an 'it' at any place of 'atness' left for one. This is Nibbāna, Arahantship, being no longer subject to Time and Death, the Unseen Consciousness of the utterly purified Mind void of any identification with 'self'.<br />

					Ānanda delivers a variation on The Gradual Course. Here he gives the laymen of Kapilavatthu a discourse on undertaking the quest for awakening from the point of undertaking the training in ethical behavior right on up to the eradication of the Corrupting Influences in Nibbāna. It is possible this sutta was intended for laymen directly, (in which case it is encouraging laymen to become arahants) but I believe rather that it was intended to encourage some to enter the order, and to show the others the nature of the practice of the bhikkhus.<br />

					The Buddha explains in detail what it means to have given up all avocations in this Dhamma.<br />
					Note that here, speaking to a layman, the Buddha is describing the attainment of the three visions of the Arahant as being attained just subsequent to the abandoning of pleasures of the senses. That is, without any specific mention of even the first jhana.<br />
					Based on this one could say that Arahantship is attainable without jhana; or one could say: The conditions for the first jhana are met with, and the conditions for the fourth jhana are met with, so there is here the attainment of arahantship with jhana.<br />
					Why is jhana not mentioned here? I suggest it is because the discussion proceeds from the request to provide the entire giving up in every way of all occupations. Jhana, as jhana, is essentially an occupation.</p>

							Sense-Pleasures</h4>

							<p class="f4">When trying to determine what is meant by the Buddha when using the term <i>kāmā</i> one should picture not a single state or class of states, but a spectrum of classes of states from the own-making (sankhara-ing) born of the yearning of the deluded Pajapati for the companionship of other beings, to common experience of [caring about] enjoyment of the sensations produced at the senses, to sexual intercourse. Visualize these images as superimposed over one-another. (A = B = C) It's not Freud's 'everything is just sex' and it's not 'ultimately everything is Pajapati's problem'. It depends on where your mind is at present. Start there. It's from there that detachment is possible. To help cultivate the mind to detachment from wherever it is focused, the Master has concocted (cooked up; sankhara'd) a number of similes: Pleasures of the Senses are:</p>

							<p class="ctr"><b>Like A Bone thrown to a Dog</b></p>

							<p class="f4">Of course not.</p>

							<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4">In the same way as in these similes<br />
							Pleasures of the Senses<br />
							are of much grief and aggrivation at the time<br />
							and lead to real danger later.</p>

							<p class="f4">Seeing the meaning of these similes<br />
							as they really are<br />
							with consumate wisdom —<br />
							you avoid<br />
							whatsoever is that which is diversity-situated diversity detachment —<br />
							whatsoever is that which is unity-situated unity detachment —<br />
							and develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4">Diversity-situated diversity detachment is the detachment of an individual who is himself diverse in nature from that which is diverse in nature. What is diverse in nature is form, sensation, perception, own-making and individualized consciousness. Ordinary detachment: aka: Poise, equanimity, unflappability, detachment.</p>

							<p class="f4">Unity-situated unity detachment is the detachment of an individual who is himself unified in nature from that which is unified in nature. What is unified in nature is the four formless realms and the state of ending perception of sense-experience. Temporary Release. Delivery from things of Time.</p>

							<p class="f4">Detachment wherein all support for the world is completely desolved is Nibbāna, the unseen consciousness, deathlessness, being outside Time. This is called "Release from things Not of Time," and is an unshakable, permanent freedom.</p>

							<p class="f4">See <a href="#mn.29">MN.29,</a> and discussion that follows it, and <a href="#mn.38">MN.38</a> and the discussion that follows that.</p>

							<p class="f4">This is precisely the difference between 'equanimity' and 'detachment' and why 'detachment' is the better translation for <i>upekkhā.</i></p>

							<p class="f4">There can be a worldly sort of detachment (equanimity) but there cannot be an equanimity without worldly objects.</p>

							<p class="f4">Equanimity = Equal minded. Equal meaning towards either side of something. Something with two sides is not a unity. Balanced between two alternatives. You cannot be equal minded within unity.</p>

							<p class="f4">Go back to the Seven Dimensions of Self-Awakening: Put Memory in charge. After doing your Dhamma Research so that you have a basis in knowledge; develop energy and enthusiasm; then progress from equanimity to serenity to detachment = equal-minded within it, serenely above it, detached from it.</p>

							<p class="f4">So, in response to:</p>

							<p class="f4">[Bhk. Bodhi's edited version of Ñanamoli Thera's translation]:<br />
							Having avoided the the equanimity that is diversified,<br />
							based on diversity,<br />
						 	do not develop the equanimity that is unified,<br />
							based on unity —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">[Lord Chalmers]:<br />
							Having shed any equanimity<br />
							which is scattered and diffused<br />
							do not develop that real poise<br />
							which is one-centred and concentrated —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">[Bhk. Thanissaro]:<br />
							Having avoided the equanimity coming from multiplicity,<br />
							dependent on multiplicity,<br />
							do not develop the equanimity coming from singleness,<br />
							dependent on singleness —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">[Ms. Horner]:<br />
							Having avoided that which is equanimity in face of multiformity,<br />
							resting on multiformity,<br />
							do not develop that equanimity<br />
							which is equanimity in face of uniformity,<br />
							resting on uniformity,<br />
							ask yourself: 'What is "equanimity in the face of uniformity based on uniformity"'? and<br />
							how could there be an equanimity towards such without grasping?<br />
							and instead of following this advice —<br />
							develop that detachment<br />
							wherein all support for the world is completely desolved.</p>

							<p class="f4">Go back to the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/mn/mn.001.olds.bd.htm#oneness">Mulapariyaya</a>: "He does not think about unity. He does not think: 'I am unity, unity is mine, I am of unity, unity is of me.'"</p>

							<p class="f4">This discourse has been about how,<br />
							in the discipline for an ariyan,<br />
							there is an entire giving up in every way<br />
							of all avocations;<br />
							about what makes up the plenitude of universal giving-up<br />
							according to the Law of the Noble;<br />
							about how the cutting off of affairs in the Noble One's Discipline is achieved entirely and in all ways.</p>

							<p class="f4">This discourse has not been about how to achieve a menatally balanced position in the world. That would be an avocation, an affair.</p>

In repeating the insident to the bhikkhus he is questioned as to what this teaching is that argues with no one about anything. The Buddha explains in brief that it is by having no interest in the obsessions and perceptions that assail the mind. Then further the bhikkhus ask for a clarification of this of Maha Kaccana, who speaks of the obsessions and perceptions that arise from sense experience.<br />

					The Buddha provides a complex simile illustrating by way of a herd of deer and a crop of corn set up to trap it the relationship of the arahant to the realm of the senses.<br />
					Following the allegory in this sutta would have us understand that, in the non-identified-with state of arahantship, the arahant may, even after death, still have at least awareness of the world. He makes his 'residence' the states of mind between the first jhana and the ending of experience of sense perception, again, not depending on any of these for identification, and makes use of these states and the sense faculties — the five senses are being made use of by the fourth group, though not to the point of wiggling those sticks!<br />
					If this sounds like herasy to you, then you need to bring to mind two other aspects of the Dhamma which dove-tail with it and explain them all in some other way. What two? The so called 'unseen consciousness', <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/green_tea/green_tea_toc.htm">(vinnana anidassana),</a> and the three 'visions' of the arahant (see for example <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p4">MN 4</a> and many others) (which include knowing past lives and knowing the outcome of deeds, both of which involve perceptions of the world.) Nowhere does it say that these two visions and this sort of consciousness are lost in the state of arahantship at death. In fact what it does say is: "And, monks, as a man might be bound in a prison, but after a time might be freed from those bonds, safe and sound, and <i>with no loss</i> of his property," <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p39">(MN 39)</a>.<br />

								Pain and Misery,<br />
								and Despair are Pain.</p>

								<p class="f4">Not getting what is wished for is Pain.</p>

								<p class="f4">Getting what is not wanted is Pain.</p>

								<p class="f4">In a word: 'These five support-compounds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="dtfn1" href="#dtn1">1</a>]</sup></span> are Pain.'</p>

								<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

								<p class="f4">And what, friends, is to be understood by<br />
								"In a word: 'These five support-compounds are Pain'"?</p>

								<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

								<p class="f4">What are the five support compounds?</p>

								<p class="f4">The shape-support-compound;<br />
								the sense-experience<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="dtfn2" href="#dtn2">2</a>]</sup></span> support-compound;<br />
								the perception support-compound;<br />
								the own-making<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="dtfn3" href="#dtn3">3</a>]</sup></span> support-compound;<br />
								the consciousness support-compound.</p>

								<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

								<p class="f4">Of these the shape-support compound is made up of the four great properties:<br />
								solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion<br />
								and the shapes that are compounded from these.</p>

								<p class="f4">These four can be either relating to an individual or be external<br />
								and in either case they are unstable,<br />
								change,<br />
								and come to an end.</p>

								<p class="f4">And that which is unstable and changeable,<br />
								and that which is compounded from<br />
								that which is unstable and changeable<br />
								and comes to an end<br />
								cannot sanely and rationally be understood as:</p>

								<p class="f4">"This I am;<br />
								This is mine;<br />
								This is my 'self.'"</p>

								<p class="f4">How come?</p>

								<p class="f4">Because that which is not under one's control<br />
								cannot sanely and rationally be called one's own<br />
								or to be said to belong to one.</p>

								<p class="f4">And to hold that a thing<br />
								that comes into being by being derived from<br />
								that which is unstable and changeable<br />
								and which comes to an end<br />
								is the self<br />
								amounts to saying:</p>

								<p class="f4">"That which is myself<br />
								comes and goes,"<br />
								which is absurd.</p>

								<p class="f4">So the sane, rational individual thinks:</p>

								<p class="f4">That Pain which has arisen<br />
								in that which I erroneously believed was myself<br />
								has arisen as a result,<br />
								or repercussion of something.</p>

								<p class="f4">A result of what?</p>

								<p class="f4">Contact of sense-organ with sense-object and consciousness.</p>

								<p class="f4">For example:</p>

								<p class="f4">If someone says something disagreeable about him, he thinks:</p>

								<p class="f4">This unpleasant experience has come to me through my sense of hearing.</p>

								<p class="f4">It is the result of something,<br />
								it is not not a result of something.</p>

								<p class="f4">Of what is it the result?</p>

								<p class="f4">Contact of that shape called sound and that shape called ear together with consciousness.</p>

								<p class="f4">The sense-experience;<br />
								the perception;<br />
								the own-made aspect;<br />
								the consciousness of that shape,<br />
								made up from solidity, liquidity, heat and motion<br />
								that is sense-organ and sense-object consciousness —<br />
								all that is unstable and changeable<br />
								and comes to an end.</p>

								<p class="f4">If being abused he should become angry and upset,<br />
								he should recollect the Parable wherein the Buddha says that even if downright bad guys should cut him to pieces with a saw,<br />
								were he to get angry<br />
								he would not be following the Teacher's instructions.</p>

								<p class="f4">He should think:</p>

								<p class="f4">'This body is so constituted that it is subject to abuse'<br />
								and he sets up recollection, investigation, energy, enthusiasm, impassivity, serenity and detachment<br />
								for the attaining of freedom from body.</p>

								<p class="f4">By that focus of his mind<br />
								on the component parts<br />
								on the made-up nature of the experience<br />
								on the task of attaining freedom,<br />
								he is detached.</p>

								<p class="f4">Detached he is free.</p>

								<p class="f4">Seeing this freedom as freedom,<br />
								he sees the end of Pain.</p>

								<p class="f4">In that freedom he can know:</p>

								<p class="f4">"Left behind is rebirth,<br />
								lived is the best of lives,<br />
								done is duty's doing,<br />
								no more is there being any sort of 'it'<br />
								at any place of 'at-ness' left for me."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<p class="f4">Suppose a collection of sticks and straw and mud enclosing a space were to be called a house.</p>

								<p class="f4">Just so the collecting, assembling, combining together of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness in skin and bones, flesh and blood, urine and vineger, hot air and gas enclosing a space is called a living being.</p>

								<p class="f4">If, friends, a sense organ is functioning,<br />
								and an appropriate sense-object comes within it's range,<br />
								and there is contact of the two<br />
								there arises sense-consciousness.</p>

								<p class="f4">That which is shape in such that has thus come to be,<br />
								that is known as a 'shape-supported-compound';</p>

								<p class="f4">that which is sense-experience in such that has thus come to be,<br />

								<p class="f4">that which is perception in such that has thus come to be,<br />

								<p class="f4">that which is consciousness in such that has thus come to be,<br />
								that is known as a 'consciousness-supported-compound'.</p>

								<p class="f4">In this way it is to be understood that<br />
								within any given conscious experience<br />
								resulting from contact of sense-organ with sense object<br />
								there is the collecting, assembling, combining together of the support-compounds.</p>

								<p class="f4">We have seen:</p>

								<p class="f4">Whatever is the walking of the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional High Way,<br />

								and attaining the state where perception of sense-experience ends.</p>

								<p class="f4">The three releases and the eight releases are releases from things of Time.</p>

								<p class="f4">The states themselves are not the release;<br />
								release is the freedom resulting from attaining these states.</p>

								<p class="f4">The eight releases are a heierarchy only in one dimension;<br />
								in terms of their being vehicles of release, each is of an equality.</p>

								<p class="f4">Focused on the release mechanism<br />
								one is only freed from the thing that came before,<br />
								a relative freedom,<br />
								which is called:<br />
								"Freedom as to things of Time".</p>

								<p class="f4">Attaining the topmost mechanism,<br />
								the state where perception of sense-experience ends,<br />
								is not freedom<br />
								and is not the goal<br />
								and the freedom attained by way of release from that is a matter of an intellectual comprehension that the state was own-made and that to attempt to construct higher mental states would only lead to getting more bound up than before.<br />
								In other words, it is an arbitrary end point to the process.<br />
								One could have stopped anywhere earlier to the same effect.</p>

								<p class="f4"><b>Release from <i>that freedom</i> —<br />
								that is that freedom attained by release from things of Time —<br />
								is release from something not of time.</b></p>

								<p class="f4">Things of Time &gt; Release from Things of Time &gt; Unstable Freedom from Things of Time <b><i>(A Thing Itself Free from things of Time, but temporary because relative to things of Time)</i></b> &gt; Release from Things Not of Time &gt; Stable Freedom from Things Not of Time.</p>

								<p class="f4">If that freedom that resulted from release from things 'of Time' were not a thing itself 'not of Time', it would not be freedom from things 'of Time'.</p>

								<p class="f4">Once again: Focus on the fact of being free from X and that is 'freedom as to a thing of Time'; focus on the freedom itself and that is 'freedom as to a thing 'not of Time.'</p>

								<p class="f4">Think of it like this: 'focus' is a detachment (an awareness of awareness; a being one step beyond) which is another way of saying 'freedom'.</p>

								<p class="f4">The Buddha is saying that if you can do this, the resulting freedom is unshakable or is what is also also known as 'the unshakable freedom of heart and freedom of wisdom'.</p>

								<p class="f4">This is having been released from things of time,<br />
								and having recognized in the resulting freedom,<br />
								that this freedom<br />
								is freedom from the corrupting influences <i>āsavas:</i><br />
								(sensual pleasure, existence, blindness, points of view)<br />
								with such clarity<br />
								that it is known and seen<br />
								that this state is of such a nature as to guarantee<br />
								rebirth is left behind,<br />
								lived is the best of lives,<br />
								duty's doing is done,<br />
								and that there is no more being any kind of an 'it' at any place of 'atness' left<br />
								that could cause one to again own-make <i>(saŋkhārā)</i> this world<br />
								or any other 'thing of time'.</p>

								<p class="f4">The freedom is too sweet;<br />
								the pain of the alternative too obvious.</p>

								<p class="f4">There is nothing missing from or incorrect about the PTS version of the Pali.<br />
								In fact I suggest that the versions of the Pali that differ are efforts to 'correct' this version and are themselves in error. The alteration requires slightly more than the simple addition of 'a' before two words. There is enough there to say that the change is conscious.</p>

								<p class="f4">In the first portion of the last case the seeker has attained release from things of Time with the resultant freedom being freedom based on things of Time. Such freedom is not stable because the base is not stable.</p>

								<p class="f4">This is the man searching for heartwood who has found heartwood and has taken it away with him seeing that it will be useful for things requiring heartwood.</p>

								<p class="f4">In the second portion, (which in other similes in other suttas is usually a repetition of the first portion) using the same method, one attains release from things of Time then release from things not of Time (the freedom attained by release from the freedom based on things of Time).</p>

								<p class="f4">The key is seeing the distinction between release, relative freedom and absolute freedom. The first man becomes the second man by using the heartwood.</p>

								<p class="f4">The problem seen by the translators, (that the first half of the sequence does not match the second half) is not a problem, it is intentional. It points to the otherwise missing (unstated) path to the freedom based on things 'not of time' resulting from release from things 'not of time.'</p>

								<p class="f4">As long as the seeker is thinking that there is something there which is giving him his freedom (something released from which he attains this freedom); his freedom is temporary because that 'something' has been own-made and is unstable. When he lets go of that, (not thinking 'This is the real me', 'I have attained this') there is no longer an unstable basis for his freedom and that freedom is absolute.</p>

								<p class="f4">The only thing that has changed between the two situations (the first portion and the second portion of this case) is the perception of the situation. It doesn't need to be re-stated in an additional case, it just needs to be seen differently.</p>

								<p class="f4">The first, temporary release, will be noted because the seeker is after permanent release, but he also knows he has the right method because temporary or not it <i>is</i> freedom, so he focuses on that and discovers ultimate freedom.</p>

								<p class="f4">This business of consciousness being able to be conscious of consciousness and of consciousness being able to be conscious of not being consciouss of things is an essential skill needed to realize Nibbāna.</p>

								<p class="f4">Presenting the issue in the combined way we have it presents a problem (the problem the translators are reacting to) which when focused on with the idea 'how can this be understood to be correct' rather than 'this does not follow the usual pattern and so must be a mistake' results in insight. It is a pedagogical technique, not a mistake. This sort of shift in the use of a frequently-used pattern is not unique in the suttas. Keep'nja onjatoz.</p>

								<p>Warning: There is frequent inconsistency in the terms used to translate <i>vimokkha</i> and <i>vimutti</i> with the terms 'Release' and 'Freedom' being used for both. Ms Horner speculates where she should be able to see the certainty: <i>Vimokkha</i> is an objective reference to the things one is freed from; while <i>vimutti</i> is the subjective experience of (mental) freedom.</p>

								<p>Relative to MN 30, the following is adapted as commentary for this sutta from a discussion where it was  stated that it was an example of an internal contradiction in the suttas. The discussion begins with this quote:</p>

								<p class="f4">Leigh Brasington on Possible Altered Sutras to do with Jhana</p>

								<p class="f4"><i>The Culasaropama Sutra (<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p30">Majjhima Nikaya #30</a>) in addition to being an excellent teaching on the dangers of spiritual materialism, also refers to the Jhanas. However, it shows signs that suggest the text has been altered.</i></p>

								<p class="f4"><i>Its beautiful mathematical harmony of the sutra suddenly breaks down in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.030.pali.bd.htm#p12">section 12</a> with a discussion of the Jhanas.</i></p>

								<p class="f4"><i>The Jhanas are a concentration practice and concentration has already been stated in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.030.pali.bd.htm#p12">section 10</a> to be a lesser state than knowledge and vision. But when the Jhanas are introduced in section 12, they are said to be "higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision." [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.030.than.ati.htm#sublime">Bhk. Thanissaro, trans.</a>] The inclusion of the Jhanas here actually makes the sutta self-contradictory.</i></p>

								<p class="f4"><i>It also contradicts other pro-Jhana sutras. The formulation of the eight Jhanas is the standard "short" one, (similiar to what is found in the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">Mahasatipatthana Sutta</a>) but with the addition of a last sentence in each of the paragraphs: "This [too] is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision." This sentence directly contradicts the last sentence of section 84 of the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">Samannaphala Sutta</a> (Digha Nikaya #2).</i> [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#p84">Horner,</a> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.02.than.ati.htm#insight">Bhk. Thanissaro</a>]</p>

								<p class="f4"><i>In the previous paragraph of the Samannaphala Sutta, the recluse directs the concentrated, pure, bright mind resulting from the fourth Jhana towards knowledge and vision. The understanding gained "is a visible fruit of recluseship more excellent and sublime than the previous ones".</i></p>

								<p class="f4"><i>Many other suttas show signs of this type of tampering and we are left today with the task of puzzling out the original teaching.</i></p>

								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<hr class="hrctr" />

								<p>&nbsp;</p>

								<p class="f4">First some definitions.</p>

								<p class="f4"><b>Pali:</b> <i>Samādhi, ñāṇa-dassana, jhāna</i><br />
								SAMĀ = Even, ADHI = Higher;<br />
								ÑĀÑA: a blend of 'Na's' 'knows';<br />
								JHĀNA = burn, shine, know, chan, zen.<br />
								<b>Bhks. Nanamoli/Bodhi:</b> concentration, knowledge and vision, jhāna<br />
								<b>Horner:</b> concentration, knowledge and vision, meditation<br />
								<b>Olds:</b> serenity, book-knowledge and understanding, attainment of a degree of detachment in the burnings.<br />
								DASSANA = seeing.</p>

								<p class="f4">There is no word for 'meditation' in the Pali, unless you understand the term literally in which case it is using <i>sati</i> (thinking about a thing). Otherwise the place is also sometimes taken by <i>'bhavana',</i> development.</p>

								<p class="f4"><i>Jhāna</i> is not 'concentration.'<br />
								Concentration is an aspect of <i>Jhāna,</i><br />
								and the second <i>jhāna</i> is characterized by <i>cetaso ekodi-bhāvaɱ</i>: the heart having become whole-heartedly single-minded (my double-meaning translation) (whole, unified, one-pointed, concentrated).</p>

								<p class="f4"><a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm"><i>Samādhi</i></a> is a general term that is defined in different ways. If it is defined as the <i>jhānas</i> as in <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#PartIII"><i>Sammā Samādhi,</i></a> High serenity, it is the first four <i>jhānas.</i> It can be just ordinary serenity, it can be a fruit of the practice of loving kindness, it can be any number of practices of other doctrines, and in this doctrine it can also be the three: Aimlessness, Signlessness, Emptiness.</p>

								<p class="f4">Within this doctrine, <i>samādhi</i> can be higher or lower than knowing and seeing <i>(ñāṇa-dassana)</i> depending on if it is attained in a manner that is informed by <i>ñāṇa</i> book-knowledge of and <i>dassana</i> seeing or understanding the goal, which in this case is described as the ending of the corruptions (<i>āsava</i>: lust, anger, and blindness).</p>

								<p class="f4">Suppose a person came upon the description of <i>jhāna</i> in Gotama's system without being informed about any of the rest of the system or it's goals such as could be the case in the case of this sutta (he is going after the heart-wood without knowing what it is). In the case of such a one, even able to attain the <i>jhāna,</i> such <i>jhāna</i> would be meaningless in terms of the Buddhist goal. For one understanding and striving after the goal then, <i>samādhi</i> by any definition, when not informed by knowledge of the goal, would be lower than the Buddhist idea of knowing and seeing. Informed by the goal, <i>jhāna</i> is an actual step in the direction of letting go of the world and therefore higher than mere book knowledge and understanding (aka, intellectual knowledge).</p>

								<p class="f4">So so far, we might put it this way:</p>

								<p class="f4"><i>Samādhi</i> is lower than<br />
								<i>ñāṇa-dassana</i> which is lower than<br />
								<i>jhāna</i> attainment informed by <i>Ñāṇa-dassana</i>;</p>

								<p class="f4">Serenity is lower than<br />
								knowing and seeing which is lower than<br />
								<i>jhāna</i> attainment informed by knowing and seeing.</p>

								<p class="f4">In dealing with the <i>Dīgha,</i> our understanding of <i>ñāṇa-dassana</i> becomes important.</p>

								<p class="f4">This is a term which is applied to the Streamwinner, not the arahant. It does not imply accomplishment of the goal which is vision of the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/paticca_samuppada.htm"><i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i></a> and because of that vision the ending of the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas</i></a> (corruptions). It is essentially the acceptance of <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm"><i>Sammā Diṭṭhi,</i></a> the Four Truths as a working hypothesis, whereas <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dittha.htm"><i>Sammā Diṭṭha,</i></a> which is actually seeing it at work.</p>

								<p class="f4">Without the book knowledge and understanding one could look for a long time from the mental state called the ending of perception and sense-experience <i>(saññā-vedayita-nirodhaɱ)</i> (if you had even heard of such a state and knew what to look for) and not see what is valuable to be seen from the point of view of the goal of this system.</p>

								<p class="f4">So in the <i>Sāmañña-phala Sutta of the Dīgha</i> the <i>jhānas</i> are used to rise to a point where knowing and seeing can be used to attain wisdom — the vision <i>(vijja)</i> which makes it possible to see what is going on and to see also that because of that it is impossible that lust and anger could arise again. But it is the freedom gained through the vision that is the fruit of the way, not the knowing and seeing. You need to go forward to <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#p97">section 97</a> to see this.</p>

								<p class="f4">This is a great example of the 'Magic' of sutta study. Going to the Abhidhamma first this would never have come up, having come up it breaks up a clot of blindness and moves the story forward. We see that this sutta must have been set up just to provoke such a question or at least to make those who believe <i>jhāna</i> is the end-all stop and think.</p>

									<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
										<p>The note to Bhks. Nanamoli/Bodhi's translation: <i>"Although the jhānas may also have been included in the attainment of concentration set forth in §10, and knowledge and vision was described as higher than the attainment of concentration, the jhānas now become higher than knowledge and vision because they are being treated as the basis for the attainment of cessation and the destrucion of the taints (in §21)."</i></p>

										<p>A non-explanation. Why, How does the change of use alter their position relative to attaining the goal? Because at this point they are informed by knowledge and vision. First he gets <i>samādhi,</i> then he gets knowledge and vision, then he uses samādhi with knowledge and vision for the purpose of attaining the goal.</p>
										<p><img src="../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
									</div>

								<p class="f4">Going to the commentators and the Abhidhamma for clarification would have given you the vague hint that is found in the note to Bhks. Nanamoli/Bodhi's translation which was apparently read by Leigh.</p>

								<p class="f4">We need to read this writing, even in the Pali, with a great deal of flexibility of mind. They said things then in ways that are heard differently today. Gotama says things using puns and other word-games. Some of these are impossible to translate. Things appear in the suttas that nobody can believe would be in 'a religious work' ... some very raunchy stuff! Things are said that are much deeper than they look at first glance. Gotama doesn't keep anything back, but his teachings are certainly layered. He always tells the truth, always answers the question asked, but what he says can go much further than what the questioner intended when asking the question. Things are said in ways that deliberately make one stop and think. So stop and think when you read these suttas.</p>

					It is interesting to note here that Venerable Moggallāna the Great is referred to as being a talker on Dhamma where usually he is noted for his supreme magic powers. As I recall it, the repeaters of the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i> were organized under Mahā Moggallāna ... which fact, (I do not have a citation) if true, would show that the sutta collections were begun well before Gotama's death and not at the First Council. I think it likely that this was the case, and if so it is misguided to speak of this or that Nikaya as preceding the others. They were more likely all begun about the same time, well prior to Gotama's death, and were all added-to as time went on.<br />

								<p>This will form a new 'Topic' in the Forum, under the <a href="df_toc.htm#Ditthadhamma!">Ditthadhamma Lokadhamma</a> Subject heading.</p>

								<p>If, in the Pali text or a translation you see a number, and it looks like this:  <a id="pg1"><span class="f2 g"><b>[1]</b></span></a> that is the page number of the original source of that text and that page number is an identified object to which you may link by appending to the url for the page "#pg1" (without the quotation marks.) When the page number is in other formats, it has not yet been given an identity. You may, however, link to it in the same way in the expectation that at some point it will be given such an id. So doing will not invalidate the link it will just point to the top of the page.</p>

								<p>Example: Use: "../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.013.horn.pts.htm#pg119" for Horner's <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.013.horn.pts.htm#pg119">MN.13, page 119</a>.</p>

								<p>Section numbers and symbols separating sections are unreliable. Different versions of the Pali have used different section numberings as have different translations. Editing of such has altered the numbering inconsistently. The precise 'rule' for determining a section is not defined consistently.</p>

								<p>Suggested style:</p>

								<p>[1] The first, (location,) portion of the Nidana.</p>

								<p>[2] The second, (occasion,) portion of the Nidana.</p>

								<p class="in2"><i>Where the first portion of the Nidana is missing, the occasion portion should still be numbered [2].

Again different parts of the different versions of the Pali and translations use different symbols 'ɱ', 'ɱ', 'ṁ', and 'ŋ'.

								<p class="f4">Suggested style:</p>

								<p class="f4">'ɱ' for the 'mg' (anusvara). It most clearly indicates pronunciation. Evaɱ me sutaɱ. Pronounce: Evam me sutam holding the 'm' sound thinking 'ming' and distinctly concluding the word.</p>

								<p class="f4">'ŋ' for the 'ng' (velar n). Aŋguttara Pronounce: Ang-guttara.</p>

								<p class="f4">'nya' for the ñ. Controversial, but think about it: While a good portion of the population does understand the pronunciation of this letter, a good portion does not and a further good portion of the portion that does understand it's pronunciation does not do it properly. How do you pronunce: Suññata? (sunya-nyatta) or Aññā (anya-nyaa)</p>

								<p class="f4">The underdot 'ḍ', 'ṇ', 'ṭ', and ' ḷ ', if understood to mean 'pronounce dis ṭincṭ ly, work as is; as do the long vowels, though in both cases for the most part they would be pronounced in the same way without any diacritical at all.</p>

					Here the Buddha reveals the root concepts of all things.<br />
					In it's expanded form (found in my translation) it is certainly a hypnotic spell, and will, as if by magic, take one back to the very origins of the world. It builds up from that by way of fundamental concepts at the root of all things, verbal and physical and beyond to Nibbāna. It is an excellent sutta, by the way, for learning the Pali language. In the myth that isn't told, this sutta, prior to Gotama was a magic spell used with the idea that it would by guiding focus on fundamentals, generate wealth (mula &gt; moola = remuneration). Hense the otherwise mysterious name for the suttas as 'The One Up Passed the Mulapariyaya.'<br />

					The Buddha urges the bhikkhus to become heirs of Dhamma, not of worldly things. By heirs of Dhamma he explains, he means putting the Dhamma into practice as he himself puts it into practice. Sariputta follows up on this exhortation with details. It is by not putting this Dhamma into practice as the Buddha did that senior bhikkhus, middle-ranked bhikkhus and juniors, one and all come to blameworthiness, and it is by putting it into practice in this way that one and all come to praiseworthiness.<br />

					Sariputta explains the path to attaining of consummate view in thirty two different ways.<br />
					In this sutta we find Lord Chalmers first encounter with the Paticca Samuppada. Some things to note: He translates 'upadana' as 'attachments' where it no doubt lead others to 'grasping', but where it should better be 'supports or fuel'; he translates 'bhava' as 'existence' which is unusual and most accurate; he translates 'sankhara' as 'plastic forces' and goes way afield trying to rationalize this choice. It is very hard when trying to translate what one can see is a very deep and profound system to simply get down to earth in one's translation. Because of this exotic translation, the step from <i>sankhāra</i> to consciousness is made obscure. I will clarify: Blindness results in own-making; own-making results in consciousness by way of having brought the sixfold sense sphere (aka nama-rupa) into existence. The PS is presented both this way (one instance of 'consciousness') and with two instances of 'consciousness.' #2 being: Blindness results in own-making, own-making results in consciousness, consciousness results in named-form, named form results in consciousness, consciousness results in the six-fold sense-sphere.<br />

					The Buddha explains the logic behind the difference between the Buddhist proclaiming faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha and those of other beliefs proclaiming faith in their teacher, teachings and fellow-believers.<br />
					A very interesting sutta! Essentially the difference is in the perception that the Buddha's system works or ought to work in accomplishing what is in effect the goal of all seekers, that there is nothing left unexplained, and that since this is not the case in other faiths, that the faith of those who follow such is never, can never be fully vested. The inference is that faith is not fully vested <i>by a Buddhist</i> until such time as he has perceived that the system works, or ought to work.<br />

					Three elders differ on the best of three forms of Stream-entry and submit the question to the Buddha.<br />
					This sutta deals with three sorts of attainments: <i>Kāya-sakkhī,</i> the 'body-with-eyes' one who has seen the true nature of body with his own eyes, so at least provisionally: 'body-knower'; <i>Diṭṭha-ppatto,</i> the 'view-secured' (bowled, in-the-bowl, bagged); and <i>Saddhā-vimutto,</i> the 'faith-freed'. The Buddha makes it clear that these are modes or types of practice that have lead to stream-entry, they are not levels in a heierarchy. Any one of the three may be working for arahantship, or non-returning or once-returning. The body witness is one who has made <i>jhāna</i> practice his main focus. The view-attainer has made perception of the truth of the teachings the main focus of his practice. The faith-freed has made faith in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saŋgha the main focus of his practice.<br />

					Providing medical treatment to three types of persons is likened to teaching Dhamma to three types of persons. One sort of person will not recover whether he receives treatment or not; one will recover whether he receives treatment or not; and one will recover if he receives treatment, but not if he does not. Similarly one sort of person will not gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; one will gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; and one will gain the path if he hears Dhamma and not if he does not. It is for the sake of the sick man who will recover if he receives medical treatment that providing medical treatment for the sick is not useless. Similarly it is for the sake of the one who will gain the path if he hears Dhamma that teaching Dhamma is not useless.<br />

					By identification with intentional deviant, non-deviant or mixed deeds one creates personal experience of deviant, non-deviant or mixed worlds.<br />
					"Volitional Activities' is Bhk. Bodhi's translation of <i>Saŋkhāra.</i> The reader should keep in mind that this word is very much like and almost a synonym of 'kamma' and needs to accommodate both the act of creation and the thing that results. The differentiation between this term and kamma is essentially the emphasis put on the personal nature of the creating and the results. To 'sankhara' one identifies with the intent to create personal experience by way of thought, word or deed. The result is personal experience formed by the nature of the intent when creating. (This sutta describes the process.) The word, properly translated must convey this dual nature and this personalizing process. I have suggested 'own-making' <i>Saŋ = own; + khāra = make.</i> and 'the own-made'. What is is not is just 'activities' or 'mental formations' or 'fabrications' or anything else without the sense of those activities etc being the means of constructing one's own personal world. But 'activities' although sankharing is activity, does not relate etymologically with the word at all, and 'mental ... and volitionl' are also 'explanations' unrelated to the word. Sticking closely to the Pali we could get: 'con-struction', 'con-fection,' 'con-juration,' 'co-formation,' etc. But where we have elsewhere the terms 'I-making' and 'My-making' why not also 'Own-making?' What it absolutely is not is 'conditioning'...which translation leads into major misunderstanding of Dhamma.

					The three points at which kamma originates and the three where kamma is ended.<br />
					The word here to understand is <i>'nidāna'.</i> Nidana = Down-bound. The 'nidana' is the first knot beginning the weaving process (kamma — pun certainly intended). Too often inappropriately translated 'cause' (as here in all translations but my own). In casual English, 'cause' is understood less as the force of creation than as simply something that happens co-insidentally: 'just because'; in precise English, 'cause' is always an imprecise concept. To make a cup of tea what is required is a cup, water, tea-leaves, a heat source, the effort of an individual and a thousand other things that are necessary for these things to exist. Which of these is the 'cause' of a cup of tea? Or a disease? Or Pain? At best one should always use 'proximate cause' or 'economic cause' but better would be to forget this idea altogether and train your thinking to understanding the idea of 'dependence'. Nidana means more like 'tied up in/to' involved with, but also 'beginning' which is the basis for the other often used translation 'foundation', 'basis.' It is also the first 'condition' necessary to begin weaving. Here what is indicated by the context is a way to say 'There are three "factors based on which" "tied to which" "dependent upon which" action begins.' "Tied-up with," "bound-up in" "Tied down to".<br />

					<p>"People never cease to change place in relation to ourselves. In the imperceptible but eternal march of the world, we regard them as motionless, in a moment of vision too brief for us to perceive the motion that is sweeping them on. But we have only to select in our memory two pictures taken of them at different moments, close enough together however for them not to have altered in themselves - perceptibly, that is to say - and the difference between the two pictures is a measure of the displacement that they have undergone in relation to us."</p>

					Maha Cunda approaches the Buddha to ask how to eliminate ideas of 'I' and 'mine'. The Buddha's response is to give him fourty-four pairs of opposites to be resolved upon, thought of, used as guides to follow, things leading upward and which will scour out ideas of 'I' and 'Mine.'<br />

					A wide-ranging very famous sutta that begins with a forceful teaching on the dangers of indulgence in sense pleasures. This sutta contains two famous similies: the similie of the snake illustrating how a wrong grasp of the Dhamma is like taking hold of a poisonous snake from the wrong end; and the simile of the raft illustrating how the Dhamma should be used to attain it's ends and then be let go. The sutta concludes with a thorough examination of the way 'not self' should be considered.<br />

					The avenues are any one of the four jhanas, the brahmaVihāras, or the arupa jhanas up to the Realm of No Thing's to be Had.

					The Buddha explains a logical way to behave when faced with uncertainty as to what one should believe.<br />
					This sutta should be read by every skeptic and every realist who can see of himself that he does not know or see such things as the workings of kamma, rebirth according to one's deeds, the existence of Heaven and Hell, gods, God or the Devil, etc. The logic of the sutta is incontrovertable, indeed. It only makes sense to cover your bets. To hold the position that 'there is no' (kamma, God, etc.) is actually to say that one 'knows,' and to say that one knows means that one is claiming to know all. How else could one know that 'there was not'? If a thing exists, it can be seen. Perhaps not by everyone, but sooner or later it can be seen. If a thing does not exist, one would need to see absolutely everything to know that it did not exist. And then, maybe you missed something. Then, too, to say that one knows that 'there is not' is to say that one knows more than those who have said that 'there is.' That is 'exalting one's self and disparaging others.'<br />
					I think Bhk. Bodhi's understanding of what he calls 'The Doctrine of Non-doing' is not well reflected in his choice of sub-title for this section. The idea is not that this is a doctrine of 'Not-doing', but that this is a doctrine where people believe that there is no kammic result of deeds, no 'doing' in the sense of creating consequences. It is saying that there is 'no <i>bad</i> (or good) action' 'kamma' 'action' or 'doing,' not 'no doing'. The idea 'bad' or 'good' implies 'consequences.' Certainly we can see with our own eyes that 'doing' has occurred. 'Kamma' here is being translated one-sidedly, that is only as the 'doing', but the idea of the 'doctrine' is that there is no 'result' (the other side of 'kamma'.) Buddhism itself can be characterized as a doctrine of 'not-doing': 'the not doing of unskillful deeds.' For example, the intent to not do a kammic deed identified with own-making in thought, word, or deed.<br />
					There is a similar misplaced emphasis in Bhk. Thanissaro's "Action and Non-Action."<br />

On revisiting his family he is first unrecognized and subjected to abuse, then his father tries to tempt him to return to the world with gold and his former wives. He is not persuaded and delivers a sermon in verses on the subject of the pains in the world. Still later he discourses to the king on four doctrines of the Buddha concerning the futility of living in the world.<br />

							<p><b>Caution!</b> While is is often very helpful for understanding a term to know the translations of that term in another language, many translations of the Suttas in languages other than English are not translations from the Pali at all, but are translations from English language translations. Consequently there is the possiblity of error being propagated across languages. So both those reading about Buddhism for the first time from a language other than English, and those English-speakers consulting other languages for insight should be careful to check the source! Your refuge is the Pali.</p>
