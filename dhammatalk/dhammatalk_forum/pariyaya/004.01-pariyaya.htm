					<p class="f4">What follows is a multi-year curriculum for Dhamma Study compiled from the What's New? pages of this website. It consists of reading materials, sutta discussions, essays, and inspiring quotations grouped as lessons circling through the Four Nikāyas multiple times. Ideally this presentation of the Dhamma would follow a study of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/table_of_contents.htm">the Gradual Course</a> or at least a careful examination of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">The Method</a> and at least one full reading of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm">the whole of the Four Nikāyas.</a> However as in essence what is found here is just a selection of suttas dealing with important topics, a beginning student of the Dhamma will not go wrong if they elect to begin here. The un-orthodox sequencing has as its primary intent the stimulus of insight.</p>

The questions to be asked when in doubt about some person's claim to be Arahant. I believe this is the first full translation of this sutta. The PTS and Bhks. Nanamoli and Bodi's  translations have abbreviations and both re-use previous translations of the last section whereas it contains differences from the previously translated Pali. Sister Upalavana's translation is linked. She often mangles English, but her predisposition is to accurate translation independant of the other translators and consulting her choices is sometimes helpful.</p>

Another in a growing collection of suttas which describes an impersonal consciousness. Not 'Bodhi Mind'! Not something that is always there and simply needs to be realized, not something which when attained is the same as that which was left behind, but a stable, happy, fear-free mind-made freedom-sustained serenity where eye is such that of the realm of shapes there is no resultant personal experience.</p>

Number 11 in the series on Respiration that was likely the source for the Satipatthana Sutta. Whatever, the description of this meditation practice in this series is very simple and clear. For the complete method start at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.001.olds.bd.htm">#1</a>. If you are confused by all the various practices out there that tell you to focus on the breathing this way and that way, 'thinking,' 'thinking,' 'thinking' this and that, then check this series out to see the original method in all it's simplicity ... though deeper than the deep blue see. Point of interest: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.009.olds.bd.htm">Number 9</a> in the series tells the story of the first introduction of the method to the bhikkhus. Very dramatic.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_54_anapanasamyutta.htm#p13">SN 5.54.13</a>]: Ānanda Suttaṃ, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.013.olds.bd.htm">Ānanda,</a></b> Olds translation. Number 13 in the series on Minding the Breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this sutta Ānanda approaches The Buddha with what appears to have been a puzzle put to him or an inspiration that came to him. He asks about whether or not Dhamma taught one way might be the equivalent of Dhamma taught another way. The Buddha confirms and explains. This is a very important point that solves many of the issues troubling Buddhist students out there. It provides yet another tool for confirming whether or not a teaching or translation is consistent with the whole. If a teaching or translation renders another teaching or translation invalid, then there is a problem with one or the other or both. It explains how 'The One and Only Way' can be taught 84,000 different ways. It helps a person with a bias overcome that bias by presenting the approach in different ways. For the person with a bias, there is a paradox which must be resolved and resolving paradoxes is always mind-expanding. A very interesting sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">This translation is completely 'rolled out' which is not the case in any other translation, and in addition, I have rolled out the Pali which otherwise is very confusing.</p>

Trades, modes of livlihood, manners of making a living that should not be undertaken by a Buddhist Lay Follower. Notice here the use of broad general or generic terms for the various occupations thus rendering the list less subject to time. 'Swords' is to imply weapons. It could have been 'knives', but knives are sometimes not used as weapons. Trade in living beings implies more than the slave trade and includes trade in animals raised for slaughter. Trade in 'limbs' or 'members' (parts) points to the role of the butcher. The instruction is not to engage in the selling of meat; there is no prohibition against the eating of meat. This is the tactic used in all such issues. This is the tactic used in the case of the trade in maddening drugs. At the time alcohol was the only problem drug but the term points to the real issue: any substance which causes a person to loose good judgment.</p>

					Continuing the Samyutta Nikaya Iddhipada Samyutta, the collection of suttas on developing Magic Powers. In this sutta we get the method for the Magic Power known today as 'shape-shifting'. <i>Vikubbanā-iddhi,</i> 'the power of transformation'. In this example it is the power to visit the brahma world in this body. This sutta is also interesting from the point of view of the fact that it is one of the few instances where Gotama is asked directly about his mastery of magic powers and specifically about one which is always at the top of the list of doubts by skeptics: the ability to do magic deeds in this body — the only state considered 'real' by the skeptic.<br />

					This ends the third sub-chapter of eight, or the first thirty-two of eighty-six suttas of the Iddhipada Samyutta. All but the first and last of the remaining suttas are completely abbreviated in all translations and in the Pali and consist of similes or benefits of cultivating the Iddhipadas as described to this point. The first and last suttas spell out only the formula for attaching the simile or benefit and only give indicative phrases and elipsis for placement of the details of the Iddhipadas. These suttas consist of a standard ('stock') set used at the end of many collections of suttas relating to a topic under development which are, however, themselves subject to a rotating variation. One can imagine if these series were spelled out here and in all the other places they occur an image in the mind's eye something like what one might experience in the actual view of a vast desert of sand-dunes stretching out to the horizon as compared to the way the same desert might be thought of without the view or indicated image in mind. In the actual view the beauty of the scope is seen and felt where in the thoughts alone all the biases one has with regard to deserts interfere with the awe inspiring direct perception. Or the sea. Or the vastness of outer space. Or a jungle. Or life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Things talk to us. What this says to me here is that I as well as the other translators and even the editors of the Pali have not yet surpassed this limitation in vision, but here have come to a stop, short of the full scope of possibility. Let me not stop here, boss! If we're going to play 'translator', let's play it for all it's worth!</p>

					<p class="f4">OK, I did two sets:</p>

It is curious to me that this term which bears so much weight — in one place it is said that by understanding this one term one could attain Arahantship — it is the term used in the last piece of advice Gotama gave to the bhikkhus at the time of his death — should simply mean: 'no-carelessness', or Woodward's: 'seriousness', or Bhk. Thanissaro's: 'headfulness', or Bhk. Bodhi's: 'dilligence', or my 'caution'. I suggest the term is a 'manta' [Skt. 'mantra'], a door to another understanding of the Pali language and the origins of all languages. ... but! Be Careful! That way mada lies!</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.465.rous.pts.htm">Jataka 465</a>]:</b> Bhadda-Sāla-Jātaka<br />
					A long, convoluted story which contains a detailed description of the story of Gotama's effort to save the Sakkya clan from slaughter by King Viḍūḍabha, son of King Pasanadi. The story is sometimes used to justify Buddhists taking up political action. Reading the story itself shows that the only lesson to be taken from this event is exercise of compassion for all sides and abstention from futile action. This came up in a curious coinsidence in the old BuddhaDust site where I posted an essay on not taking revenge on September 10, 2001. On reflection it occurred to me that it was also curious that the person to whom I was responding had posted an essay advocating taking revenge and using violence in self-defense just at this time and seemingly out of the blue ... a person not heard from since.</p>

					Note that included in the topics of talk called 'animal talk' which should be avoided is talk about existence and non-exisetence of things. This includes 'self' — the discussion of whether or not there is a self, the statement that 'There is no self', are not proper subjects for discussion. The topic suitable for discussion is that there is 'no thing there that is the self'. The former is an opinion, the latter is something that can be observed.</p>

The king asks the goose: "Well, friend, is there any speed swifter than yours?" "There is, my friend. Swifter than my swiftest a hundredfold, a thousandfold, nay a hundred thousandfold, is the decay of the elements of life in living beings: so they crumble away, so they are destroyed."<br />

					<b><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.6/jat.6.547.cowl.pts.htm">Jataka Story 547: Vessantara Jataka.</a></b><br />
					A greatly beloved and much written-about story. I find it excruciatingly boring drivel and embarasing for it's values as well.<br />
					The Jataka stories, or at least some of them, are held to be of very early origin. I see the collection as a mixed bag. In some cases stories emerge from stories that can be found in the suttas and I don't find even some very fantastic things that appear in them to be too hard to take. This story appears to me to be some poet gone mad with the sound of his own voice and the sway of his emotions and there is what looks to me like a confusion concerning just exactly who it is that is telling this story.<br />
					Still, if you are going to call yourself educated in the Buddhist literature, this is a story you need to have read at least once.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm">Jataka Stories</a></b><br />
					The entire collection of The Pali Text Society translation of the Jataka Stories edited by Professor E.B. Cowell. This collection is in the Public Domain. The collection here has been re-formatted and proofed correcting a few errors ... mostly problems with footnotes. The stories here are each on separate html files which will facilitate different organizations of collections of these stories for text-readers. Not all these stories are sutable or of interest to all audiences.<br />
					The primary value of this collection is the vast volume of 'lore' that it contains. Fascinating descriptions of magic powers and potions, customs and rituals and the manner in which tasks of ordinary life at the time were conducted.<br />
					Another value, not to be under-estimated, is the inspiration these stories can give to both adults and children. There is here a treasure trove of stories that will instill values such as courage, perseverance, resourcefulness, honesty, generosity, wisdom, learning, self-sacrifice, performance of duty for those in rule and for all to their parents, and many other high values.<br />
					It should be remembered, however, that these stories, even where they are very likely genuinely uttered by Gotama, represent the values held by Gotama prior to his having become a Buddha. Most of the stories represent high values acceptable both in the world and for the Buddhist renunciate, but there are exceptions and it should be remembered that what is being suggested by these stories pertains to worldly existence. Doctrines held by characters in these stories should not be used to support arguments concerning what is taught in the Dhamma except where they are in accordance with the Suttas.</p>
