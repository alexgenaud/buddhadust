				<p class="f4">The static format of this forum was conceived as an on-line journal, seeking submissions with substantial content that should be preserved but which would also allow for expansion and rebuttal. This seemed to be a better way to handle intelligent dialogue than the dynamic forums, which better serve as support communities, but where the sometimes very interesting and valuable contributions are quickly buried in on-going chatter.</p>

				<p class="f4">Essentially it failed as a Forum. There was precisely one contribution submitted in all the time it was available. Where it has more or less succeeded is as a platform for the presentation of my take on the Buddha's science of Awakening.</p>

						<h4 class="ctr"><i>Loka.</i> The World</h4>

						<p class="f4">1. What is perceived through the senses. Through the eye: Light <i>(rūpa).</i> Through the ear, nose, tongue, and body: sounds, scents, savours, contact = substantiality. Through the mind: perception, sense experience, sensation, intention, consciousness = things <i>(dhammas)</i>. 2. the world of the perceiving existing being. 3. The location of or gathering place of beings. A focal point of existing things. For the individual being it is 'his' body; for groups of beings it is 'their' consensus reality. In sort <i>'loca'</i> is a name for where beings and things that have come into existence are located. A focal point of existence.</p>

						<p class="f4">PED:</p>

						<p><b>Loka</b> [cp. Vedic <i>loka</i> in its oldest meaning "space, open space." For etymology see <i>rocati.</i> To the etymology feeling of the Pāli hearer <i>loka</i> is closely related in quality to <i>ruppati</i> (as in pop. etymology of <i>rūpa</i>) and <i>rujati.</i> As regards the latter the etymology runs <i>"lujjati kho loko ti vuccati"</i> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.082.pali.bd.htm">S IV.52,</a> ... see <i>lujjana.</i> The Dhtp 531 gives root <i>lok (loc)</i> in sense of <i>dassana</i>] world, primarily "visible world," then in general as "space or sphere of creation," with various degrees of substantiality. Often (unspecified) in the comprehensive sense of "universe." Sometimes the term is applied collectively to the creatures inhabiting this or various other worlds, thus, "man, mankind, people, beings." - <i>loka</i> is not a fixed and definite term. It comprises immateriality as well as materiality and emphasizes either one or the other meaning according to the view applied to the object or category in question. Thus a translation of "sphere, plane, division, order" interchanges with "world." Whenever the spatial element prevails we speak of its "regional" meaning as contrasted with "applied" meaning. The fundamental notion however is that of substantiality, to which is closely related the specific Buddhist notion of impermanence (<i>loka</i> = <i>lujjati</i>).</p>

						<p><b><i>Rocat</i>i</b> [Vedic <i>rocate, ruc,</i> Idg. <i>&deg;leuq,</i> as in Latin <i>luceo</i> to be bright (cp. lūx light, lūmen, lūna etc.); Sanskrit <i>rocan</i> a splendid, <i>ruci</i> light, <i>roka</i> and <i>rukṣa</i> light; Av. <i>raocant</i> shining; Gr. <i>αμϕι-λύκη</i> twi-light, <i>λευκός</i> white; also with 1: Sanskrit <i>loka</i> world, locate to perceive, <i>locana</i> eye; Lith. <i>laukti</i> to await; Goth. <i>liuhap</i> light = Ohg. <i>lioht,</i> E. light; Oir <i>loche</i> lightning. - The Dhtp (and Dhtm) gives 2 roots <i>ruc,</i> viz. the one with meaning <i>"ditti"</i> (Dhtp 37), the other as <i>"rocana"</i> (Dhtp 395), both signifying "light" or "splendour," but the second probably to be taken in sense of "pleasing"] </p>

						<p><b>Lujjati</b> [Pass. of <i>ruj,</i> corresponding to Sanskrit <i>rujyate.</i> Dhtp 400 gives <i>luj</i> as sep. root with meaning <i>vināsa.</i> See <i>rujati</i>] to be broken up, to break (up), to be destroyed; to go asunder, to fall apart</p>

					<p class="in1">"Speech, originally, was the device whereby Man learned, imperfectly, to transmit the thoughts and emotions of his mind. By setting up arbitrary sounds and combinations of sounds to represent certain mental nuances, he developed a method of communication - but one which in its clumsiness and thick-thumbed inadequacy degenerated all the delicacy of the mind into gross and guttural signaling.<br />
					Down - down - the results can be followed: and all the suffering that humanity ever knew can be traced to the one fact that no man in the history of the Galaxy, until Hari Seldon, and very few men thereafter, could really understand one another. Every human being lived behind an impenetrable wall of choking mist within which no other but he existed. Occasionally there were the dim signals from deep within the cavern in which another man was located - so that each might grope towards the other. Yet because they did not know one another, and could not understand one another, and dared not trust one another, and felt from infancy the terrors and insecurity of that ultimate isolation - there was the hunted fear of man for man, the savage rapacity of man toward man.</p>

					<p class="f2 in1">We must object to the statement that no man has ever understood his fellow men, and to the one that suggests that Hari Seldon, standing in for Isaac Asimov, did, at least in so far as it is demonstrated in this book. What is the case is that very few have ever learned how to understand their fellow men from those that did understand and taught the way to do so in a way that could have been understood by them.</p>

						<p class="in2"><b>Quickies:</b><br />
						<b><a id="futureshock">Future Shock,</a></b> Alvin Toffler, Random House, N.Y., 1970. Relevance: Transience. I thought this would throw some light on <i>anicca.</i> It does, but, of course what he is dealing with is worldly transience. His proposition is that the new technologies emerging in the world speed up transience and this will result in mass disorientation. The first half of the book is very informative in its discussion of the areas where technology will cause disruption. The book was 50 years ahead of its time and is required reading for anyone who has the feeling that the insanity here today is more than the usual older generation viewing the younger generation as more corrupt than they were and who wishes to understand what happened. The second half of the book is useless predictions and methods for counter-acting the damage of transience. Interesting because most of the predictions and methods suggested for coping were tried and failed.<br />
						<b>2001 A Space Oddesy.</b> Stanley Kubrick, Director. Relevance: Pajapati's Problem. Creates in the viewer the overwhelming sense of boredom experienced by 'the one and only.' Some people, and some robots call this the best movie ever made. I could barely force myself to watch it through. Pretentious in the extreme. Slow. Plodding. Disrespectful of the viewer's intelligence. Looks like the idea was cop't from Kurt Vonnegut; the whole history of mankind being directed at one point ... in this case the return of man to a point where he begins the whole story again. Every scene goes on and on interminably. ... and did I say the movie was boring? I side with the computer that wants to scuttle the whole project.<br />
						Franz Kafka, <b>The Trial:</b> Not really helpful. Pajapati's problem allowed to become paranoia, no helpful or edifying solution pointed to.<br />
						Knut Hamsun, <b>Hunger</b> Hamsun has not yet reached Pajapati's problem in this one. Here he portrays a true to life, autobiographical picture of his struggles with hunger. Really useful from the point of view of understanding why Food is #1. So much of his trouble results from poor training in understanding ethics which allows his pride to bring him back to starvation again and again.<br />
						<b>Mysteries.</b> Another early work which reveals the madness faced by the mind that has reached into the upper atmosphere without adequate training in ethics. This book was the inspiration for the yellow suit of The King of New York (aka P.P.). As an aside the first thing one will encounter when beginning to read Hamsun is the bewilderment on the part of reviewers as to how it could be possible for such an intelligent, sensitive person to also have been a Nazi sympathizer. Even casual reading of <i>Mysteries</i> should answer that question. The seeds of a radical political view are a central theme! There is no mystery as to how the writer of this book could come to champion the early Hitler as a crusader for a break-away from somnambulist politics, the idea that Hitler espoused of detachment from all current political forms in favor of a more noble past. At a later point there is good reason to think that Hamsun's Nazism was a ruse used to gain influence with Hitler so as to attain the liberation of Nazi prisoners in Scandinavia. Still, he clearly advocated racial purity; he considered the U.S., for example, as destined to fail as it was becoming a mongrel nation. (I prefer to see it in more positive terms as a nation of hybrid strains, one which has and could still result in hybrid vigor and which is certainly producing a human of extraordinary physical, if perhaps too feminine beauty.) The book is a great read. It is often laugh-out-loud funny in a mad sort of way when the central character piles lie upon lie, outrageous action upon outrageous action making every aspect of the world crumble around him. However it has little use for anyone who does not already appreciate the dangers of irrational behavior.</p>
