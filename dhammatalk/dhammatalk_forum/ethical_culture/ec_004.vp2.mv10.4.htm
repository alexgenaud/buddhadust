					<h1>Better to Walk Alone</h1>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'Loud is the noise that ordinary men make.<br />
					Nobody thinks himself a fool, when divisions arise in the <i>Saṅgha,</i><br />
					nor do they ever value another person higher than themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'Bewildered are even the clever words<br />
					of him who is versed in the resources of eloquence.<br />
					As wide as they like they open their mouth.<br />
					By whom they are lead they do not see.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'"He has reviled me, he has beaten me, he has oppressed me, he has robbed me," -<br />
					in those who nurse such thoughts,<br />
					hatred will never be appeased.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'"He has reviled me, he has beaten me, he has oppressed me, he has robbed me,"-<br />
					in those who do not nurse such thoughts,<br />
					hatred is appeased.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'For not by hatred is hatred ever appeased;<br />
					by not-hatred it is appeased;<br />
					this is an eternal law.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'The others do not know<br />
					that we must keep ourselves under restraint here;<br />
					but those who know it,<br />
					their quarrels are appeased.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'They whose bones are broken by their foes,<br />
					who destroy lives,<br />
					who rob cows, horses, and treasures,<br />
					who plunder realms, -<br />
					even these may find conciliation.<br />
					How should you not find it?</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'If a man find a wise friend,<br />
					a companion who lives righteously,<br />
					a constant one,<br />
					he may walk with him,<br />
					overcoming all dangers,<br />
					happy and mindful.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'If he find no wise friend,<br />
					no companion who lives righteously,<br />
					no constant one,<br />
					let him walk alone,<br />
					like a king who leaves his conquered realm behind,<br />
					like an elephant in the elephant forest.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'It is better to walk alone;<br />
					with a fool there is no companionship.<br />
					Let a man walk alone;<br />
					let him do no evil,<br />
					free from cares,<br />
					like an elephant in the elephant forest.'</p>
