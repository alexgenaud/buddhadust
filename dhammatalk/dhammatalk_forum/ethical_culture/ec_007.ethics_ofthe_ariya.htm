					<h1>The Ethical Standards Much Praised by the Aristocrats<br />
					or<br />
					The Fourth Dimension of Streamwinning</h1>
								
					<p class="f4">These are referred to as 'training rules' or 'the householder's seeker's path'. They should be taken on with the idea: "Let me train myself to abstain ..."</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><b>(1)</b> <i>pāṇa-tipātā veramaṇī,</i> abstention from injury to breathing things. This is <i>intentional</i> injury. But it is 'injury', not just 'killing,' and 'breathing things' includes plant life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><b>(2)</b> <i>adinn'ādānā veramaṇī</i> abstention from taking what is not given.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><b>(3)</b> <i>abrahmacariyā veramaṇī</i> abstention from carrying on in an ungodly (non-Brahma; not-the best) way. Forgetting ethical standards in the pursuit of pleasure. Often translated abstention from adultery or chastity, but this is too narrow. As with #5 below the idea is the abstention from injurious behavior caused by pursuit of pleasure, not the specific pleasure. Where sexual transgressions are  specifically described the idea for laymen — the rules for bhikkhus, and the practices leading to the higher attainments such as non-returning are much more restrictive — is abstention from sexual intercourse in cases where the result would be dangerous to the self or harmful to another: <i>i.e.,</i> with another person's mate(s) or betrothed, with those still living with their parents, with those protected by the state or powerful individuals.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><b>(4)</b> <i>musā-vādā veramaṇī</i> abstention from negligent speech. The idea of <i>'musā-vādā'</i> is that which is said carelessly, not only lies but also thoughtlessly saying things that are not true, exageration, slander, passing along rumors, cussing, intentionally hurtful, provocative, insulting speech and name-calling, gossip, and speech which just wastes time;</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><b>(5)</b> <i>surā-meraya-majjapamāda-ṭṭhānā veramaṇī</i> abstaining from careless behavior resulting from fermented or distilled drinks. This is alcohol. For us, with our plethora of intoxicants, drugs, psycho-active chemicals and insideous influences in our commodities, the general rule would be where the use of a thing causes careless behavior or neglegance. This 'rule' was a later addition to the first four and is really encompassed by them, and we can see in the case of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_55_sotapattisamyutta.htm#p24">SN 5.55.4</a> and other similar cases, that the emphasis is on the consequence in neglegance, not the use of the substance.</p>
