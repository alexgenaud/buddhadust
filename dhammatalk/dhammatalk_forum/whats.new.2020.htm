					<p class="f4">The God of the Old Testiment and Indra: primative attempts to understand the preditory, destructive and painful nature <i>(dukkha)</i> of this world? And a groping after some manner of alieviating these forces by propitiation? (correcive, compensatory, preventative <i>kamma</i>)?</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p class="f4 ctr">Can a layman righteously live on donated food?</p>

					<p class="f4">Its complicated. Technically there would be no problem. The problem comes up with living up to the technicalities. And this is a problem not only for the layman, but for everyone. It is of special concern these days when we read of huge lines for free food because of the hardships created by the Covid virus.</p>

					<p class="f4">First off I think (my opinion!) there is a distinction between a needy person reciving hand-outs from a food bank and a person seeking food to support his spiritual quest.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the needy person receiving food from a food bank, the food has been collected or received by the food bank with the intent of feeding the needy. There is no breach of trust in this transaction and the actual donators are not technically involved. They have given to the food-bank and will get good <i>kamma</i> as giving to such a recipient dictates. (It won't be a complete waste! The food is being given to people who have generous intentions.) It is unclear to me as to the ownership of food-banks, but I believe <i>kamma</i> requires an intelligent recipient to be really effective, (just the giving itself is good <i>kamma,</i> but the effect is magnified hugely when there is a worthy recipient. [<a href="#O.10.28.20">more on this</a>]) so it would be the owners and employees of such an entity that would be the object and they would get the good <i>kamma</i> from giving and their expectations would not rise above that of giving food to the needy, <i>i.e.,</i> they should have no expectations of any great result (and it is unlikely that such a thing even enters their minds in this case). Still, I would think twice about taking food from such a place if one were not in genuine need.</p>

					<p class="f4">The case is more serious when it comes to <i>bhikkhus</i> and laymen seeking 'alms'.</p>

					<p class="f4">First I must deal for the umteenth time with the idea that the <i>bhikkhu</i> is begging. The <i>bhikkhus</i> that object to this name fail to see the symbolism and advantages of living at the bottom of the pile and needing to beg for food. They think: "Mendacant" "Receiving Alms". But what were these practices originally but efforts to humble the self by putting oneself at the bottom of the pile and needing to beg for food and other supports?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ok, then, what is the issue? It is being worthy to live off the labor of others who give with the hope of great <i>kammic</i> returns from a person working at the problem of escape from <i>samsara, kamma, dukkha.</i> And in this <i>Dhamma</i> at least that is no easy thing even for the <i>bhikkhu</i> sheltered by the <i>Saṅgha.</i> For a layman it is next to impossible. It isn't impossible, but take a long careful look, layman, and ask yourself if you are worthy to have another person work for you and pay <i>you</i> in food.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what should you do if you want to study <i>Dhamma</i> full time but do not yet feel capable of renouncing the world completely and joining the <i>Saṅgha?</i> Work hard, make as much money as you can, live frugally, don't get involved with "cigareets and whiskey and wild wild women, they'll drive you crazy they'll drive you insane" [Jim Croce] (and spend all your money). Be sure to make gifts to the <i>bhikkhus</i> of the essentials you would want to see returning to you: food, clothing, medicine, shelter. Give to the <i>Saṅgha</i> as opposed to individual <i>bhikkhus.</i> Retire early and have faith in the great fruit of generosity.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c">Pīti</h4>

					<p class="f4">This is one term that gives people a hard time, especially as it is closely related to and frequently accompanies <i>sukha</i> and the difference is not immediately evident. It is important even for beginners to understand as it is one of the essential ingredients for the first and second <i>jhānas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The difference between <i>sukha</i> and <i>pīti</i> is that <i>pīti</i> is <i>saṅkhāra-k-khandha,</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.11.24.20fn1" href="#O.11.24.20n1">1</a>]</sup></span> that is <i>Pīti</i> is or is to be own-made, constructed on the spot whereas <i>sukha</i> is the sensation/sense-experience consequent upon previous action. The latter arises 'spontaneously' in <i>jhāna,</i> whereas <i>pīti</i> must be brought about.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, there is the discouraging influence of <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro's translation of <i>pīti</i> exclusively as 'rapture.' I don't know why he persists in using this term as I am sure he has no intention to discourage people from attaining <i>jhāna</i> but experience will teach one that one does not sit down and raise rapture without a serious apprenticeship to the early, less dramatic stages of this state:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>The Fivefold <i>Pīti</i></b><br />
					<i>pañca-vaṇṇā pīti</i></p>

					<p class="f4">[<b>1</b>] <i>khuddikā</i> (slight sense of interest),<br />
					[<b>2</b>] <i>khaṇikā</i> (momentary joy),<br />
					[<b>3</b>] <i>okkantikā</i> (oscillating interest, flood of joy),<br />
					[<b>4</b>] <i>ubbegā</i> (ecstasy, thrilling emotion), and<br />
					[<b>5</b>] <i>pharaṇā pīti</i> (interest amounting to rapture, suffusing joy).</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Pīti,</i> like <i>jhāna,</i> is not a static thing, it evolves and is a stage in the evolution from involvement with the world to detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cultivation of <i>Pīti</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Pīti</i> is not something you aim your mind at to cultivate: "Let <i>pīti</i> arise; let <i>pīti</i> arise!" You need to come at it sideways. I use "appreciation"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.11.24.20fn2" href="#O.11.24.20n2">2</a>]</sup></span> as a basic root meaning of <i>Pīti.</i> Appreciation (as well as the other stages of <i>Pīti</i>) is not really something you 'do', it is more along the lines of 'when you notice certain things, appreciation of them arises of its own". Your job is noticing. And for bringing it about for the first <i>jhāna,</i> what is wanted is focus on the advantages of solitude. The peace and calm; the detachment from the hassles of this world. Focus on the advantages and an appreciation of the state arises. Once you have got the nack you can branch out and will see that <i>Dhamma</i> practice provides an abundant source of things to appreciate. Then expand your awareness of the advantages and the appreciation becomes deep and broad and soon will fit the more profound terms in the spectrum of states that is <i>pīti.</i></p>

In this case the difference between 'perceiving' and 'thinking' is significant. What this does is describe the result of the thinking, thus overlooking the method of attainment. To attain this realm one abandons certain factors and thinks: "There is nothing" (which means not that there is nothing, but that there is nothing there that can be 'had' or 'owned' or 'possessed'.

					The Buddha explains the meaning of 'living in the <i>Dhamma</i>'. It is not enough to study the suttas, teach the <i>Dhamma,</i> repeat the suttas, think about the <i>Dhamma,</i> but one must also have the wisdom to grasp the attainment of the goal itself.<br />
					A significant feature of this sutta is the fact that the attainment of the goal is through the application of wisdom <i>(paññā).</i> Wisdom is a matter of taking known knowledge and experience and coming up with a solution to a problem, answer to a question, method for attaining a goal; knowing what to do. It isn't really the discovery of anything new, such as with insight. It is more a matter of having the heart for the attainment. The use of will-power and resolution to overcome reluctance to attain what one already knows can be attained and how it can be attained. Here we have an explanation for the idea of 'sudden awakening' for which we have an example in Ananda's awakening at the last minute before he is called upon to recite <i>Dhamma</i> at the first council where he thinks to himself that he himself ought to become Arahant before joining this auspicious assembly of arahants, and he becomes <i>arahant</i> there and then.<br />

					The Buddha teaches the need to act skillfully in even the smallest things by way of comparing the way he teaches <i>Dhamma</i> with the way the Lion strikes at even the smallest game, that is, with consummate skill.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>"Sir Joshua Reynolds once asked him [Johnson] by what means he had attained his extraordinary accuacy and flow of language. He told him, that he had early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his best on every occasion, and in evey company: to impart whatever he knew in the most forcible language he could put it in; and that by constant practice, and never suffering any careless expressions to escape him, or attempting to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the clearest manner, it became habitual to him."<br />
							Boswell, <i>The Life of Dr. Johnson, London, 1791.</i></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">A short sutta but one that teaches an extremely helpful discipline. Hare translates the Lion's reason for his care no matter what the prey by 'Let not my skill fail me!' but it would be better as 'Let not my skill deteriorate!' The lesson is that the important thing is the skill with which one acts, not the circumstances in which one acts. Lazy habits infect one's entire practice. This world is like a vast swiftly-flowing river; a slight change in a small object may not appear to have an immediate effect, but in a short time it will have exerted some influence on every molecule of that on-going flow. Beings are the inheritors of their deeds.<br />

					This sutta describes a course to non-returning based on the practice of seclusion and having cultivated the first <i>jhāna</i> wherein the first three <i>saṇyojana</i> are broken and further there is a restraining of <i>abhi-j-jhāya</i> and <i>vyāpādena</i> (Woodward's coveting and malevolance). Note that the usual fourth <i>saṇyojana</i> is, <i>kāma-c-chanda</i> so that what may be being said is that the restraint of coveting is the essential aspect of wishing for sense pleasures that must at least be restrained to attain non-returning.<br />
					The BJT and CSCD pali and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi break this sutta into two at section 4. The BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has this section include all four <i>jhānas;</i> the CSCD and the <i>Pāḷi</i> apparently followed by <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi have, as is the case with the PTS <i>Pāḷi,</i> only the first <i>jhāna.</i> Except for following what was done before, there is no sense to breaking the sutta into two at this point.<br />
					<i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi notes that the commentary wants to deny that this is a non-returner, but all the commentary does is invent the name '<i>jhāna</i>-non-returner' and define this in the same way as the non-returner is defined which is just what the sutta does. The essential thing the commentary wants to inject into the thinking about this is that this non-returner does not enter a <i>Brahmā-loka</i> or the Pure Abodes, but goes to some <i>kāma</i> world (that would include the Tusita realm) and attains Final <i>Nibbāna</i> there. There is nothing in the sutta itself to confirm or deny this, but attainment of the <i>Brahmā Lokas</i> is said to be done by way of attaining the first <i>jhāna</i> even for commoners. Add this to the picture of the non-returner in the outline above. This is a good example of the kind of mess you can get into trusting the commentaries to explain things.<br />

					The version of the <i>Pāḷi</i> on this site has been fixed, but the BJT version picks up the previous sutta without making all the necessary changes.<br />
					Three things from which originate actions, <i>kamma, karma.</i> This is the reverse case of the previous. This pairing of opposites is a frequent practice in the suttas precisely for situations like this where an exact understanding of the terms must be had to put them in both positive and negative form or they turn the sutta into a mess. Woodward notes that here <i>'Nidana'</i> as 'cause' doesn't work but he uses 'cause'. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi also uses 'cause'. Its an ego thing. A reflection of <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's problem.</a> The arrogance of the ego that at heart thinks it is God the Creator of the Created: the cause of all this. It's inconceivable that things arise without being 'caused'. How come? "Because I can see that I exist, and I can see that things arise in the world as I become conscious of them and therefore I am the cause of things arising in the world." But: "This being, that becomes," is not a causual relationship, its an associative relationship. The beginning of both this and the previous sutta is: "There are these three <i>nidana</i> giving rise to <i>kamma,</i>" Here the three are not-lust, etc. Using 'cause' we are saying that a not-thing is the cause of an action. If we understand <i>'nidana'</i> to mean, 'bound up in, tied to, (rises in association with)' we then have a sensible translation: Lust is tied to (even based on, even dependent on) the origination of <i>kamma.</i> Not-lust is tied to the origination of <i>kamma.</i> Any <i>kamma</i> tied to lust is no good, any deed not tied to lust is good. In the second case the <i>kamma</i> is the intentional not-doing of any action based on lust. <i>Kamma</i> which ends <i>kamma.</i><br />

					The very interesting thing in this sutta (once it is unabridged and straigtened up) is the visibility here of the way in which at least one style of dialog was conducted (there are many examples of this style in the suttas). Gotama lays out four cases and asks Potaliya to say which he thinks is best. Potaliya chooses one which is not the one which Gotama thinks is best. Gotama states that of the choices, a certain one is best. (No "you are wrong, I am right", but no waffling either. He makes the statement "This is the best, and for such and such a reason." In response Pataliya does not say "you are right, I am wrong," but indicates his acceptance of Gotama's case by stating it as Gotama has stated it explaining it as Gotama has explained it. This is the combat of two ideas without bringing in the personalities. Potalia might have disagreed up to three times and Gotama repeated the case up to a third time before Potaliya's head split into seven pieces.<br />

					<p class="f4">Something for someone to research: In the commentary on the Sutta Nipata Paramatthajotika II, pages fifty-two and sixty-seven (This from PED; I do not have this commentary and cannot vouch for the page numbers)) there is used the term <i>"Pacceka-bodhisatta"</i> one destined to become a <i>paccekabuddha. </i>This throws off the idea that a <i>bodhisatta</i> is one destined to become a <i>Sammā-saṃbuddha.</i> What is, if there is one, the vow that is made that creates this condition? Must it be made face-to-face with a living Buddha? Why would one, face-to-face with a living Buddha wish to become a solitary <i>(paṭi + eka) </i>Buddha? ... actually I can see a motive there: What a hassle this Buddha is experiencing with all these people demanding his attention, etc. The predelection of one who loves solitude would find this a better path than that of Arahantship. And it is a much shorter path than that of a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">See also: <b>Padesa</b> [from <i>pa + diś,</i> cf. late Sanskrit <i>pradeśa</i>] indication, location, range, district; region, spot, place <i>-bodhisatta</i> a limited <i>Bodhisatta</i> Kv 283 (cf. <i>PtsC.</i> 1393, 1662);</p>

					<p class="f4">This leads to a second thought concerning Pirsig's (<a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/book_reviews/br_021.persig_zenaaomm.htm">see</a>) clarity of mind: what if this clarity, as well as being a result of a powerful mind, was also helped into being by being wiped out with the convulsive electroshock treatment? All the useless crap in there wiped out but not quite a complete 'do-over'; and in recovering his memory he would then be able to objectively evaluate the old memories against a new perspective gained with a more mature mind? (And we do see this sort of re-evaluation going on in the book.) Electroschock in stead of re-birth? I don't think I would try that in my old age; it took him years and years to recover. I think something similar might be accomplished with LSD; a total re-evaluation of one's purposes in life if one makes the effort to squeeze out every ounce of insight from the experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">An issue raised by the idea of the <i>Pacceka-Buddha</i> is that this is, in terms of accomplishment, arahantship. Yet these individuals do not die 24 hours after attaining <i>Pacceka-Buddhahood</i> and do not join an order. Another discouraging word which we can put to the side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is an interesting and possibly very valuable research project for someone: Nearly every term used in the standard formulas of the <i>Dhamma</i> has synonyms. What are the distinctions? Are the synonyms all found in the Four <i>Nikāyas,</i> or do they exist only in commentaries? Or is our familiarity with only certain formulations an illusion based on selective attention? What are the possible implications of the choices made by Gotama? Do the distinctions suggest better translations for the popular terms?</p>

					The Brahmin Brahmayu, at the age of 120, is converted and becomes a non-returner when he sees the thirty-two marks of a great man in Gotama and is taught a gradual course in <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					This sutta has several interesting features. The casual mention of this Brahmin as being 120 years old and 'reaching life's termination'! is only one of several such examples of life expectancy at the time. The thirty-two marks of the Superman are always a good challenge. Try and work out in your mind how these marks can be both physically visible and representative of superiority or special powers in a being. Note the manner of the exchange; that is, in verse. This was a frequent form of debate and required that the one challenged reply to the challenge in the form of the challenge. Verse required a reply in verse, etc. Today such debates are still to be found in Spain and Arab countries and in musical battles in many countries. Also note the extreme politeness and respect in the brahmin's behavior.</p>

					A sutta which provides a detailed run-down of most of the major <i>'dhammas'</i> or groups of concepts central to the Buddha's system.<br />
					But what does 'purification of almsfood' mean? This is the situation of the <i>bhikkhu</i> (that is, a beggar) that he is asking people to support him from the fruits of their labour in order for him to be free from such 'work' so as to be able to devote his full attentions to the gaining of the goal, arahantship, absolute freedom. This is something we all seek in our hearts, but few have the courage to attempt. Further, understanding and believing in <i>kamma,</i> the rich fruit of giving, this bargain seems to be a good one for most people. ... that is if the beggar actually spends the time granted to him by the food he has eaten in the earnest effort to achieve the goal. For the <i>bhikkhu</i> that which is time not spent in this pursuit is impure time and that is reflected in the benefits to the householder that gave. So the effort of a scrupulous <i>bhikkhu</i> is to make his time productive and by that purify the gifts given to him.</p>

					The Buddha is not able to halt the argument and contention of the <i>Saṅgha</i> in Ghosita's <i>vihara</i> in Kosambī and so moves on to Visit Bhago in Balakallonakara village where he teaches him <i>Dhamma</i> and then he visits the Anuruddhas staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove there. There he teaches the Anuruddhas in great detail the process of eliminating the obstructions to clairvoyant sight and describes the method of <i>jhāna</i> practice in threes which he himself used to attain arahantship.<br />
					The over-all message of the sutta is that when the <i>bhikkhus</i> do not live in harmony with each other they obstruct their access to <i>Dhamma,</i> when they live in harmony access to <i>Dhamma</i> appears.<br />
					An absolutely invaluable sutta when it comes to developing insight, clairvoyance and the <i>jhānas.</i></p>

					<p>It is here that we see the actual meditation method used by Gotama: The 'method in threes':</p>

					<p class="f4">I.i. Develop serenity <i>(samādhi)</i> with thinking (vitakka) and pondering <i>(vicāra);</i><br />
					I.ii. Develop serenity without thinking, just a measure of pondering <i>(vicāra-matta);</i><br />
					I.iii. Develop serenity without thinking or pondering;<br />
					II.i. Develop serenity with entheusiasm <i>(pīti);</i><br />
					II.ii. Develop serenity settling down entheusiasm;<br />
					II.iii. Develop serenity in connection with happiness;<br />

					<i>[then, not stated as such, but I suggest are, the second and third parts of the third part:]</i><br />
					III.ii. by that attaining freedom,<br />
					and in freedom seeing freedom,<br />

					Venerable Anuruddha is instructed by Sariputta to get rid of his conceit about his great powers of clairvoyance, his arrogance about his strenuous energy and his worry about attaining his heart's release from corruption. An important sutta in terms of comparing translation with translation. What is presented in this translation is a picture of Sāriputta's keen perception into the various nature of illusion and his ability to translate his perceptions into the precise prescription necessary for attaining the goal. Previous translations have cast this as a case of Sāriputta <i>chastizing</i> Anuruddha for his conceit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is very easy to read this sutta as directing Anuruddha's attention away from his clairvoyance, etc, and onto a something called the <i>amata-dhātu;</i> [<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p53">A. iii, 356,</a>] "The Deathless Property, or deathless element or characteristic, but what is being said is that (for the reasons of pride, etc.) he is looking at the thing itself (the clairvoyance) where he should be looking at the clairvoyance from the point of view of its transience, pain yielding and selfless nature; that will get rid of his pride and anxiety which is what is blocking his heart's release. Its a matter of perspective. It is not a matter of having particular objects in view. This is important! This is The Method. That is, seeing things from the perspective of the Four Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">NOTICE: I have got myself into a pickle here and need to take off some of the pressure. I have recently begun to proofread the PTS <i><i>Pāḷi</i> English Dictionary</i> against the 2015 reprint corrected by K.R. Norman, William Pruitt and Peter Jackson. As of now at page 279 of 660; ETA about April '21. In the process I am discovering that it is in much worse of a mess than I had thought. It is also going much more slowly than I had anticpated (and it should be done without haste or pressure). It is also apparent to me that this is an extremely important work to have in reasonable shape for people to use. This warning is to alert readers to be careful when using the file in its current shape and to somewhat relieve the time pressure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Proofing is being done on the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.utf8.txt">.txt file version.</a> (It is recommended you use the .txt version<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.10.24.20fn1" href="#O.10.24.20n1">1</a>]</sup></span> until proofreading is completed when it will be converted to .htm.) Progress in proofing to date is shown there. Watch especially for words with "sing" which will be found as "singular"; "past participle" for "opposite"; "Kās" for "Kṣ"; "kāsa" for "kesa", "kusa" and "kosa"; and the "°" symbol used to indicate the entry term is always "-" past the point where proofreading has ended. There are other regularly-found errors that cannot be corrected with a regex (the problem in the first place, that is, multiple abridgings using the same letters and mishandling — previously existing, accidental and based on ignorance — of the power of the regex). Still this file is largely correct and is easier to use than the Chicago version and will be more up-to-date when proofing is complete.</p>

					The Buddha refutes the accusation that he allows the eating of the flesh of animals killed specifically for him and he explains the peramaters that allow the eating of meat.<br />
					A sutta to consult when the endless debate over vegetarianism comes up. Let me have another shot at clarifying the situation. There is <i>kamma,</i> and there are the rules for the <i>bhikkhus,</i> and there is doing good deeds. As far as <i>kamma</i> goes, the operant factor, the efficient cause of a <i>kammic</i> consequence, is intent. Where there is no intent to cause harm, there is no (harmful) <i>kammic</i> consequences. The rules for the <i>bhikkhus</i> are based on the law of <i>kamma.</i> There being no intent to harm in connection with eating meat that was not killed by one's self, killed upon request by one's self, or suspected to have been killed specifically for one, there is no (harmful) <i>kammic</i> consequence and there is no rule against eating meat of such a sort. Where some individual decides that he wishes to reduce the demand for meat that is the motive for the butchering of animals, that is an intentional good deed and is to be praised. When an individual blames a person who does not have any intent to harm living creatures, but who eats meat as per the factors that make it <i>kammically</i> blameless, then that person is blind to the nature of <i>kamma</i> and is making bad <i>kamma</i> by holding a wrong mental position. And the louder and more forcefully they do that, the worse is the bad <i>kamma</i> they make. Finally, the <i>bhikkhus</i> are beggars. Beggars should not be choosers. They are in the right refusing meat that is not allowable because in the refusal is a lesson given to the doner of what is allowable. But in the ordinary course of the begging round for a beggar to refuse meat lawfully given is to deprive the doner of good <i>kamma</i> and that is bad <i>kamma.</i> There are countries which are primarily vegetarian and situations where the <i>bhikkhu</i> may have a choice. In the case where the doner of a food gift gives the <i>bhikkhu</i> a choice, there is no problem with his requesting to be given vegetarian food only. The layman, of course, can choose to be a vegetarian or not according as he wishes with no adverse consequences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Miscellaneous fact: Here and there in translations and in the PED you will come across the term 'corn' for translations of <i>kiṭṭha</i> and <i>khala</i> which perplexes USAmericans who know that corn is native to the Americas and was not brought to India before 1492. Maybe: 'Corn', British English for grain and more specifically a grain, kernel, seed of one of the cereals: wheat, rye, barley, etc. and applied to both the grain and the whole plant. More specifically still it applies to "the chief cereal of a district" (New/Shorter Oxford English Disctionary). So oats are the corn of Scotland, and wheat is the corn of England. So if you see a reference to a corn market in England, it means a market for wheat. To the British, USAmerican English 'corn' is maize, Indian corn, Zea Mays. Though history tells us maize was only brought to India after the 'discovery' of the new world there are stories of the Chinese doing trade with Mexico as early as 300 BC and doing trade with Jambudipa at that time could well have introduced it then. Both <i>kiṭṭha</i> and <i>khala</i> apparently refer to wheat which was cultivated there as early as 3000 BC.</p>

					<p>(neuter) [Sanskrit <i>citta,</i> originally past participle of <i>cinteti, cit,</i> cf. <i>yutta &gt; yuñjati, mutta &gt; muñcati</i>. On etymology from <i>cit,</i> see <i>cinteti</i>].
					I. Meaning: the heart (psychologically), <i>i.e.</i> the centre and focus of man's emotional nature as well as that intellectual element which inheres in and accompanies its manifestations; <i>i.e.</i> thought. In this wise <i>citta</i> denotes both the agent and that which is enacted (see <i>kamma</i> II introduction), for in Indian psychology <i>citta</i> is the seat and organ of thought (<i>cetasā cinteti;</i> cf. Greek <i>ϕρήν,</i> although on the whole it corresponds more to the Homeric <i>θυμός</i>). As in the verb <i>(cinteti)</i> there are two stems closely allied and almost inseparable in meaning (see &sect;III ), viz. <i>cit</i> and <i>cet</i> (<i>citta</i> and <i>cetas</i>); cf. ye should restrain, curb, subdue <i>citta</i> by <i>ceto,</i> M I 120, 242 (cf. <i>attanā coday'attānaṃ</i> Dhp 379<i>f.</i>); <i>cetasā cittaṃ samannesati</i> S I 194. In their general use there is no distinction to be made between the two (see &sect;III). — The meaning of <i>citta</i> is best understood when explaining it by expressions familiar to us, as: with all my heart; heart and soul; I have no heart to do it; blessed are the pure in heart; singleness of heart (cf. <i>ekagga</i>); all of which emphasize the emotional and conative side or "thought" more than its mental and rational side (for which see <i>manas</i> and <i>viññāṇa</i>). It may therefore be rendered by intention, impulse, design; mood, disposition, state of mind, reaction to impressions. It is only in later scholastic language that we are justified in applying the term "thought" in its technical sense. It needs to be pointed out, as complementary to this view, that <i>citta</i> nearly always occurs in the singular (= heart), and out of 150 cases in the <i>Nikāyas</i> only 3 times in the plural (= thoughts). The substantiality of <i>citta (cetas)</i> is also evident from its connection with <i>kamma</i> (heart as source of action), <i>kāma</i> and the senses in general.</p>

					<p class="f4">Two ideas make the understanding of "Heart" difficult for the Western mind: The idea that this 'faculty' is located in the chest; and the idea that it deals primarily with the emotions (this reflected in the above definition).</p>

					<p class="f4">The more utilitarian way of understanding this concept is that it is the center of one's being, and that thought arises to and is comprehended by this heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am just starting Robert Pirsig's <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.10.13.20fn2" href="#O.10.13.20n2">2</a>]</sup></span> I have always put this book off as a fad thing or because I pretty much detest philosophy, but I finally decided to read it and I find it quite enjoyable and not heavy at all. Pirsig makes a really strong effort to make himself understood by us 'common people'. Right away (pg 82) there is an idea that seems important, so here is a short note on his understanding of the process involved in becoming conscious of our personal world and particularly the idea of discrimination.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the way, just in case, this is not 'discrimination' in the sense of holding irrational derogatory opinions about things; this is distinguishing, singling out for awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have never understood the Sutta definition which, in translation, is that it is called discrimination because it discriminates.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pirsig comes at it this way: Awareness is an individual's general awareness of the world. Something we cannot manage, or rather is not useful, because of its overwhelming detail, so what we do is take a sample: we discriminate (his term)(re: his term: it is uncertain (to me as yet) how much actual Buddhism Pirsig has under his belt, he may himself have picked this term up from a teacher or book (<i>viññāṇā</i> is translated this way by the translator for Ajhan Dtun, and Ajhan Dtun may have had it from his teachers, it may be the common understanding in some schools), he is obviously aware of Buddhism to some degree).</p>

					<p class="f4">Well that is not a <i>Dhamma</i> description, but it helps. Re-cast, I describe it this way: The five lower sense organs come into contact with their objects and the resulting information is picked up by the mind-sense as its sense-object. It is here that the mind composes from that raw data (= Pirsig's 'Awareness'), our perception of the world: <i>i.e.,</i> it discriminates between the valuable and the chaotic. Here 'mind' or even 'mind minding (recalling, remembering, recognizing; <i>sati</i>) mind' would then seem to take the place of our 'consciousness'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This avoids much of the confusion raised by the fact that the Arahant has (or does) <i>viññāṇā (<i>e.g.,</i> viññāṇā-anidassana).</i> So 'discrimination' is, in this description, a preliminary to 'consciousness' which idea is not even mentioned, or rather is taken for granted or as just suggested is to be understood in some other term like <i>'sati'</i> or <i>'mano'.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I do not think my "re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" (or, for short: re-knowing-knowing) is invalidated by this understanding but is made much clearer; translating <i>viññāṇā</i> as 'consciousness' may need revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is discrimination a <i>'dhatu'</i> (element; characteristic; data)? We might say: upon the conjunction of <i>nama/rūpa</i> and <i>viññāṇā</i> what results is a discriminated thing (a thing carrying its own identification of itself); the result of that is the possibility of making it conscious against the larger chaotic background; discriminatability, then, is a characteristic that accompanies that which becomes and which allows it to be distinguished from its background by whatever it is that is conscious (<i>i.e., sati,</i> memory (for what is consciousness really other than memory?), <i>mano,</i> mind (for what is mind really other than consciousness?) ...).</p>

					<p class="f4">This also makes the note in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15</a> much more comprehensible: It is only in so far as there is discrimination of named/forms that there is that which is called an existing thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Persig illustrates his idea by picking up a handful of sand from a sandy landscape; we can use this illustration by thinking of drawing out from the uncreate our own personal world. And from that we can now much more easily see that <i>Nibbāna</i> is the dumping back into that landscape of that handful of sand. Just that is <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">So the message is: Forget about consciousness here, that just complicates things, what is important is the way we create and become aware of the personal world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In short this translation of <i>viññāṇā</i> simplifies/clarifies the whole story.</p>

					The Buddha instructs a number of <i>bhikkhus</i> about the various pitfalls facing the <i>bhikkhu.</i> He provides four similes: one for anger, one for gluttony, one for the five cords of sense pleasures and one for sexual lust.</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p class="f4">The distinction between <i>pīti</i> and <i>sukha: Sukha</i> is pleasure, <i>Pīti</i> is appreciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasure arises to the individual, is the experience of pleasant sensation consequent upon contact of sense organ with sense-object, and is a result of past <i>kamma.</i> Appreciation covers the spectrum from mild appreciation through liking, enthusiasm, affecion, delight, zest, exuberance, love and rapture and is an emotional reaction in the present. <i>Pīti</i> is classed under <i>saṅkhāra-k-khandha,</i> not <i>vedanā-k-khandha."</i> In other words it is own-made, constructed; new <i>kamma.</i> That is commentary, I think it can be both, depending on circumstances.</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p class="f4">Among the recent slew of insane attitudes of the day is one in which a white academic (an academic is a person in the position of teacher, a person who claims to be a good example, someone to follow) pronounced that "Being white in America is by definition racest."</p>

					<p class="f4">By definition?</p>

					<p class="f4">Actually this is a true statement. Any person identifying themselves by race, is a racest by definition. And I would go farther and say any person that identified themselves with a race likely did that out of preference for the things they identified as being attributes of that race and that that would make racests of just about everyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think: "I am about to be reborn. I want to be liked; I want to be popular; I want to live the good life that I see is possible in this world; let my hair color be such, my eye-color be such, my skin color be such, let me be born in a wealthy privilaged family, let me be not too tall, not too short, not to fat, not to thin ... complete in every faculty." Are you a racest?</p>

					<p class="f4">Related to this is the madness of Buddhist <i>Bhikkhus</i> and <i>Bhikkhuni's</i> and laymen and lay women Buddhists thinking of joining the order getting worked up about sexual orientation. The opportunity to become a <i>bhikkhu</i> is the opportunity to rise above sexuality! How on earth is a person identifying as 'homosexual, or bisexual, or trans-sexual' rising above sexuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Another meaning for <i>'bhikkhu'?:</i> "having completed the lower life"; "having mastered what one's teacher <i>(guru)</i> (of the Vedas, etc.) had to teach". One sent out from the teacher's abode to hunt up (beg for) the teacher's fee. Which teacher's fee would be reintrpreted in the Buddhist system as putting the <i>Dhamma</i> into practice. So we can say a person is worthy to be called a beggar who has rejected the doctrines of other beliefs and taken up the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This definition is not ment to supplant but to augment the idea that the beggar is symbolic of God come down in the disguise of the lowest of the low in order to ascertain the true behavior of the people and to guide them to higher things than material concerns.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">I have just finished reading <i>The Razor's Edge</i> by W. Somerset Maugham. An interesting novel in the style where fictional characters are made to debate philosophical points. (This work, well written and constructed, is more or less painless in this regard. And Maugham is an interesting person to follow for us as Buddhists because he was instrumental in influencing the career of H. E. Musson aka <i>Bhk.</i> Nanavira.) Here we follow the character Larry in his search for the meaning of life which culminates in his mastering to his satisfaction, the techniques of an Indian guru and going out into the world to live life accordingly. By the time I reached highschool this sort of thing had been worked to death and was rightly called 'sophomoric'. One line, spoken by the character Larry, paraphrased by me, sticks in mind:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>"If I did not have certainty about <i>kamma</i> and rebirth I would go mad trying to make sense of the injustice and cruelty of this world."</b></p>

					<p class="f4">It is the only explanation of why bad things happen to aparently 'good' people that my mind is able to think of as rational. True, it goes against the grain of everything believed by the good-hearted to think that a rape victim, or an assault victim or the person with birth defects, or victims generally (living in poverty, being ugly, having many illnesses, etc.) are in fact experiencing the consequences of earlier (especially including previous births) badly done <i>kamma.</i> And for sure the fact that a person experiences some bad luck should not be seen as justifying another person inflicting pain on people — that is a separate thing and will have its consequences in its own time. But at the same time to claim, with no more evidence than that required for a belief in <i>kamma</i> and rebirth, that these things are the work of some God, or are just a matter of chance does not inspire effort at elevating one's behavior. If for no other reason than that, it would be well if everyone at least acted in ways that indicated a belief in <i>kamma</i> and rebirth: suffering the consequences of badly done deeds without complaint and endeavoring to conform to the ethical standards that are derived from the theory of <i>kamma.</i> It certainly beats blaming someone else for what happens to one which just perpetuates the cycle, leaves one in a state of anger and gives no one satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have worked much harder, and not succeeded half so well; but I never could have done what I have done, without the habits of punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate myself on one object at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come upon its heels, which I then formed. Heaven knows I write this, in no spirit of self-laudation. The man who reviews his own life, as I do mine, in going on here, from page to page, had need to have been a good man indeed, if he would be spared the sharp consciousness of many talents neglected, many opportunities wasted, many erratic and perverted feelings constantly at war within his breast, and defeating him. I do not hold one natural gift, I dare say, that I have not abused. My meaning simply is, that whatever I have tried to do in life, I have tried with all my heart to do well; that whatever I have devoted myself to, I have devoted myself to completely; that in great aims and in small, I have always been thoroughly in earnest. I have never believed it possible that any natural or improved ability can claim immunity from the companionship of the steady, plain, hard-working qualities, and hope to gain its end. There is no such thing as such fulfilment on this earth. Some happy talent, and some fortunate opportunity, may form the two sides of the ladder on which some men mount, but the rounds of that ladder must be made of stuff to stand wear and tear; and there is no substitute for thorough-going, ardent, and sincere earnestness. Never to put one hand to anything on which I could throw my whole self; and never to affect depreciation of my work, whatever it was; I find, now, to have been my golden rules."</p>

					<p class="f4">Several years ago (3.3.12) I had an interaction with a Daniel Ingram, MD MSPH, Arahat. As what I wrote was a fairly thorough scouring, and as Daniel did in fact remove his claim to be an Arahant from his website, I removed the dialog and proceeded to forget about this fellow. At present there is again a flare-up concerning Daniel, this time over on Discuss Sutta Central concerning an article by a <i>Bhikkhu</i> Analayo covering the same territory.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Daniel's position has apparently not changed in the slightest, and I find <i>Bhk.</i> Anallayo's article totally inadequate to the issue, I am now re-posting the dialogue with Daniel, this time without any intent to influence Daniel, but with the hope that the way I dealt with the case will make the issues clear and show the direction responses to this individual should be focused.</p>

					<p class="f4">In <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro's translations of MN 107 and MN 125, (see just below) he footnotes his translation of sati-parimukhaṃ ["brings mindfulness to the fore"]:</p>

					      <p class="in2">To the fore (parimukhaṁ): An Abhidhamma text, Vibhaṅga 12:1, when discussing mindfulness of breathing, defines this term as meaning “the tip of the nose or the sign of the mouth.” However, the term appears as part of a stock phrase describing a person engaged in meditation, even for themes that have nothing to do with the body at all, such as sublime-attitude (brahma-vihāra) meditation <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p64">(AN 3:64).</a> Thus it seems more likely that the term is used in an idiomatic sense, indicating either that mindfulness is placed face-to-face with its object, or that it is made prominent, which is how I have translated it here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dismissing entirely what the <i>Abhidhamma</i> says as being an opinion, not a translation, there are a couple of things that are problematic about this statement. First is that though the purpose of this little procedure is not always explicitly connected to the body, the process itself is in no case in the <i>Suttas</i> separated from the body: if you want to practice the <i>brahma-viharas,</i> you do it with the body. When you bring the mind foreward it is foreward relative to the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Second is that this translation does not explain the <i>'pari'</i> = 'around'. OK, you could say that this was a sloppy instruction "somewhere around the forefront of your thinking'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the beginning point of the meditation process and is the instruction as to where to 'base' (not 'place') your attention. I say this is your base of operations. It is not that the mind, once placed, is never to move away again, it is that this is the place when the mind has ventured out into the exploration of some thing or another it returns (it is trained to return); its function is as a base of operations and also as the point of departure when it comes to the letting go of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, finally, the effort in meditation is not to mind minding (which is what is implied by the instruction to make it the important thing — at this point (where we are using <i>sati,</i> it is already trained)), it is to use minding to see things as they are. To make minding the foremost object of one's meditation is certainly important for the beginner in the development of centering as a habit, but beyond that point: well-trained go unrestrained.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Crossing the Stream</h4>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>or</b></p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>Seyyathā pi</i> — "Its just as if ...".</h4>

					<p class="f4">"This Middle Way, what is it like?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"<b>Its just as if</b> you were attempting to cross a swiftly flowing stream, you do not fight the flow and you do not go with the flow.</p>

					<p class="f4">How do you manage that?</p>

					<p class="f4">If you enter the stream and face the flow you present the maximum target with a weak stance and even if you can maintain your balance you are heading straight up-stream, not across the stream. This is fighting the flow and you will lose.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you enter the stream and try to go straight across your stance is weak (you get no advantage from the strength in your legs and feet because they are exerting their energies in one direction while the pressure of the flow is from another direction) and you will get knocked down when you lift a foot to move ahead. This too is fighting the flow; in this case by not respecting its power. And you will lose.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you go with the flow you are collaborating with the flow and it will carry you away to be done with as it wishes and you will accomplish nothing. You lose.</p>

						<div class="floatr wpx">
						<p class="f1">Would that be<br />
						an aṭṭhaṅgle,<br />
						or a bojjhaṅgle?</p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">But if you enter the stream, and respecting the power of the stream, you enter it in a way that neither fights it nor collaborates with it but cuts through the middle: facing it, but at an angle that utilizes all your strengths,</p>

					<p class="f4">you present a smaller target than face-on;</p>

					<p class="f4">you are presenting an oblique target which deflects much of the pressure of the flow,</p>

					<p class="f4">you get all the benefit from the strength and agility of your feet and legs and your stance becomes very strong,</p>

					<p class="f4">you learn the dangers because they are ever present to your consciousness,</p>

					<p class="f4">and if you are not careless, <i>(pamāda)</i> or come to a halt mid-stream,</p>

					<p class="f4">you will be able to make your way across.</p>

					<p class="f4">Act this one out in your mind when you sit. It will help you to understand what we are about. You should not just do this visually in your mind's eye, but you should also 'feel it'. Imagine the pressure of the flow on your legs; the insecurity of your stance, the way to firm up your stance.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In a united society, as with fresh milk straight from the cow,<br />
					the cream rises to the top,<br />
					but in a disunited society, as in a melting pot,<br />
					the scum rises to the top.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is needed, to suggest the obvious, is a leader that strives not to enhance only his own or his own side's position and to destroy any on the other side, but one who strives to unite all the people he is leading.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decisions should be made by consensus. There is time. Certainly there is more time than that used up making decisions that fail because they do not serve the purpose of the whole and then going back to make corrections that just throw the balance off in the other direction.</p>

					<p class="f4">In unity there is strength.<br />
					Disunited a fall is to be looked for as each side works at destroying the others and by that wastes and destroys what internal strengths there are.<br />
					Going more slowly because of consensus decision making will at least avoid the blame of being careless and wrong and the progress that is made will have a strong united base supporting it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the point of this? Aside from putting a smile on your face? Pidgin and Creole are sort of between languages. They make communication possible between two peoples whose native languages are diverse using the absolute minimum of the most used and useful words in both languages. The result is the use of terms that are early and basic and cover a very large territory.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what we have here in front of us is a strong hint at what we should be looking for in a language which was intended to be timeless, understood easily by an ear capable of intuiting precise meaning from broad general terms.</p>

					<p class="f4">In other words, an accurate translation of the <i>Pāḷi</i> will not reflect subtle shades of meaning by abstract terms. And the corrolary is that when subtle abstract terms are used in a translation of <i>Pāḷi</i> it should be read as a translation aimed at a specific strata of individuals, <i>i.e.,</i> it is not timeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the Grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain EM maintains that observing one's farts is the real meaning of minding the breaths. I don't agree, but this is certainly a very clear way to 'see' the meaning of 'not-doing'. Either action, pushing or holding back, is intentional involvement and makes it your act not just a function of body, <i>i.e.,</i> it produces <i>kamma.</i> Otherwise you generate no <i>kamma</i> from the event.

					<h4 class="ctr c">Crossing the Flood</h4>

					<p class="f4">Just <a href="#O.7.11.20.2">below,</a> in the context of how to handle a situation where for some reason someone is attempting to force one to do something one does not want to do, I have suggested that the best course is to neither comply nor resist. Elsewhere I have used 'neither resist not collaborate', but both 'comply' and 'collaborate' are a little vague and can be misunderstood.</p>

					<p class="f4">To attempt to clarify this ambiguity and since this represents a method frequently cited in the suttas I am here presenting the idea in several contexts. In the end, however, push coming to shove, this is a case that can easily result in a life-on-the-line situation.</p>

					Str. Upalavanna: not taking a footing, not exerting — sank, led astray.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The different terms used in these examples are variations of an underlying theme: how to respond or not-respond in a situation where to react either favorably or antagonistically where it is possible to do neither would be to create <i>kamma</i> for the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">I think of this in terms of the occupation of a country by enemy forces where in order to remain neutral one should neither join a resistance movement nor collaborate with the enemy.</p>

					<p class="f4">The problem with both 'resistance' and 'compliance' is that they are involvements with the world. We are after not being involved with the world. This position could rightly be said to be at the heart of every aspect of the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">But how does one handle this when it is up close and personal?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a case <span class="f2">[<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_09_vanasamyutta.htm#p12">SN 1.10.12</a>]</span> where the Buddha had entered the lair of a <i>yakkha</i> who then ordered him to get out. His response? "Very good, friend." And he left. The <i>yakkha</i> then ordered him to enter, and the Buddha's response was the same and he entered again. The <i>yakkha</i> repeated this a second and a third time with the same results. At the fourth iteration, the Buddha got fed up and said: "No, friend, do whatever you must do."</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking this example as our paradigm, the proper way to handle the situation would be to follow the order to the letter and not more ... provided the order did not involve a requirement that we ourselves act unethically or subject ourselves to unreasonable arbitrary demeaning demands. I believe this does not fall under the heading of 'compliance' or 'collaboration' (though outside thinking in terms of <i>kamma</i> it might well be thought of in this way) and would not carry any <i>kammic</i> consequences in that it can be seen that it is simply not making the <i>yakkha's</i> life difficult. In other words, it is not collaborating, it is not resisting.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that way we do not cause problems for the <i>yakkha</i> giving us orders — we must maintain compassion for him! and, after all, we are being asked to do something insignificant and harmless!</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where one is being ordered to perform an act that would result in harm to the self or another and where one refused to act, one has got one's self into a righteous pickle, and this might be a case where one has put one's life on the line for one's beliefs and one must just think self-asuring thoughts like: "At least I can live with myself in this matter!" or "It is not because of this that I would find myself in deep <i>kammic</i> du-dukkha!" or "Some people go around looking for someone to help them commit suicide, here we have found one without looking."</p>

					<p class="f4">As a practicing Buddhist, the task facing you is not 'minding' mindfulness; or living in the present moment!</p>

					<p class="f4">You live in the present moment, not attending to the past or the future, in order to supervise the task in front of you which is escape from this existence, <i>kamma,</i> pain, the present moment.</p>

					<p class="f4">You set up minding in order to understand other things, <i>e.g.,</i> body, sense-experience, mental states, the <i>Dhamma;</i> the things that are holding you back or down or the things that are helpful to release.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of this case we have the issue, not of 'where to place the minding', but of where to establish a base, or center of operations from which we can monitor the various aspects of individuality (body, sense-experience, mental states, The <i>Dhamma</i>) such that we can quickly detach when we have accurately seen these things as they are: un-stable, painful, and not one's own.</p>


					<p class="f4">For that purpose what is wanted is something that is connected to this body and therefore this world or existence because what we are about is escape from that and you do not escape from that by wishing, or daydreaming of freedom, or by minding minding, but by seeing it as it really is. The idea is that if you have a base, you can be free to let go of everything else, so you will be connected until you have managed to disconnect, but that connection needs to be the absolute minimum connection possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Remember this from the refrains in the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22"><i>Satipaṭṭhana Sutta:</i></a></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Or thinking:<br />
							'This is body'<br />
							he sets up minding<br />
							<b><i>just enough</i></b> to get a measure of knowledge,<br />
							a measure of recollectedness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this need to pay attention to the thing we are trying to escape that is being mistaken for the job of 'living in the here and now' 'living in the moment'. We do not pay attention to our center of operations as a goal. We pay attention to our center of operations in this visible state because that avoids drifting off into the past or dreaming about the future both of which are antagonistic to the understanding of what is going on in the present that keeps us tied to this business of revolving lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is going on in this business of revolving lives?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well one thing that should cause one some serious reconsideration of the situation here is to see that at the end, at death, they take everything away. Everything. Your wealth, your possessions, your house, your loved ones. Your body. Your dreams. Your individuality. Stripped away. Again and again at a predictable point in every life.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what are you going to do?</p>

					<p class="f4">You will just have to start over. Build the whole thing up again from scratch. Even though you know it will end up the same way as in the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is going on here?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, if you have any remnant of some past life connected to the real world, you might recall that there is an industry called farming. In that business The Farmer<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.7.16.20fn1" href="#O.7.16.20n1">1</a>]</sup></span> cultivates the soil and plants his seeds and attends to their care so that the result is a healthy crop.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he harvests the crop.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are being raised and harvested with your own eager ... eager? ... no, greedy for it, enthusiastic persuit toot toot <b><i>participation!</i></b></p>

					<p class="f4">In your own-making (<i>saṇ</i> = own; <i>khāra</i> = make) you are a co-maker (<i>saṇ</i> = with; <i>khāra</i> = make) of your own exploitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">So you should quit.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the meaning of 'not-doing'. That is the point and explanation of that term.</p>

					<p class="f4">This world belongs to Māra: "Mine is earth, water, firelight and wind!" Join with him and be dwarfed. A thing to be done with as he pleases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or stop this co-dependency.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go 'on strike'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think: "That Māra takes back whatever I have created with his substance is like being in debt. I will no longer allow myself to be in debt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tied to existence in Māra's realm is like having a fatal disease. I will no longer suffer this disease willingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This world is like being in prison, in bondage, unsafe and insecure with nothing of one's own (and being made to pay for it to boot.) I will no longer be a prisoner who is being made to pay for his own imprisonment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being Māra's crop is like being a slave, not one's own man, subject to others, not free to do what one wants. I will no longer willingly cooperate in my own enslavement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being prosperous in Māra's world is like being a rich merchant, traveling on the highway through a wilderness filled with robbers, murderers, and kidnappers! I will no longer, for the sake of wealth I cannot keep, put myself in such danger.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, after finding some place to be alone, sitting down, sitting up straight, and taking the mind and placing it on the task of setting up mindfulness and keeping it there to the point where concentration (whole-hearted single-mindedness) has been strongly established, and after minding the interface between the personal and the external world in terms of body, sense-experience, mental states and The <i>Dhamma</i>; and after focusing down on the personal through minding the body and the sense-reactions at the face, and after coming to the conclusion that existence identified with <i>'this'</i> own-made, co-dependent thing is the problem and resolving to let it go, the need is to set up a base of operations for that job of letting go that is as minimally connected to this world as can be managed. That would conveniently be made directed at the area around the mouth — 'area around' rather than 'the mouth' in order to avoid making 'minding' the minding of minding which would be the result of fixing the mind at a certain point and keeping it there forever and ever and ever.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><i>Sati pari-mukhaṃ.</i> Mind around the mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exercise: sit. At this point plus about ten seconds, you will have moved your arm, or your foot or some other part of your body. So this time pay attention. This time intentionally do not-do any intentional movement. What happens next is that what would otherwise result in you moving some part of your body is frustrated. Frustrated it is made manifest. Made manifest it can be seen. Seen it has been made conscious. By not-doing, you have forced the motive for your 'doing' into consciousness. Conscious you can evaluate. Evaluated it will be seen as thirst, <i>taṇhā.</i> So seen it can be let go.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The Mask</h4>

					<p class="f4">This problem of whether or not one should mask, is deeper than it looks. The solution in the current reality is simple: you wear a mask when those in authority tell you to.</p>

					<p class="f4">But what about the ethics? For a person concerned with their <i>kamma,</i> what is the best thing to do? It gets complicated very quickly. Take a look:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wear a mask.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should I?</p>

					<p class="f4">It isn't just a matter of your freedom, or bravery or self-interest; my safety is involved here too. It is a symptom of mental derangement not to be able to see things from any point of view but that of one's own self-interest. What we have here is a situation where a person may be able to infect other people for several days before showing any symptoms. A person can be infecting others without knowing it. Therefore it must be assumed that everyone is a possible transmitter. So everyone needs to wear a mask.</p>

					<p class="f4">No. You are dictating the limits of my freedom based on irrational fears. If masks work, then wear a mask and you are safe. If masks don't work what good is it going to do you for me to wear a mask?</p>

					<p class="f4">Its not that. Its that the mask reduces the volume of pathogens both of the sender and receiver, so the chances of infection are lowered.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see. So this is a matter of relative danger. So given the fact that this virus has been around for more than half a year now and is pulling a rating something around the mortality range of malaria, who is it gets to decide the 'rational' freedom vs. danger ratio? Right now, its out of wack.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well in the end, it is everyone for himself. The world is a predatory place and the number of dangers are countless. We all make a decision (or we just follow along with what some gang has decided) as to our odds tolerance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that is just my point! The logic being used to push the must mask position does not level off at the general concensus odds level. We do not quarantine the world for the flu. We do not quarantine the world for respiratory diseases amounting to 3.91 million deaths/year.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sanity meter clearly points to the anti-maskers here as occupying the rational position.</p>

					<p class="f4">Except that they don't.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose it goes in a bad way?</p>

					<p class="f4">That brings us back to the real world and is the real issue: at this point in the history of this virus, as individuals, we just simply do not have enough information and the information we do have is full of lies and insanity. Self-protection, in terms of <i>kamma,</i> suggests the prudent course is to obey the law or the health authorities right or wrong. That way the <i>kamma</i> is theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the ethical position to be taken by the authorities?</p>

					<p class="f4">They should do pretty much what they are doing: throw at it whatever seems reasonable to them and see what sticks. The lesser authorities, if in doubt, can follow the authorities higher up. What seems reasonable can go either way. The decision as to which way is up to them. One way or another they have been placed in the position of authority and if they are incompetent, that falls on those who put them into their positions. USAmericans, for example, have never demanded that competence be a qualification for public office. A huge percentage of the voter-age population abstains from participation in the vote in protest against the way the system is set up, but they are silent and demand no voice. So the country is lead by the winners of popularity contests. In a democracy the people get the leaders they deserve. Where authorities go wrong is in not fully weighing collateral damage of their decisions: <i>e.g.</i> the number of deaths that will result from prolonged economic slow-down/stand-still.</p>

					<p class="f4">And personally, I think there should be transparency. It could hardly be worse than the confusion we have at this point. Say straight up: "We still havn't a clue! We are throwing everything we think is reasonable at this and we just need to be patient until we find out what is what. We are open to suggestions."</p>

					<p class="f4">Fat chance.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will come a point where the knowledge of the morbidity of this virus and its likely mutation pathways will be known. At that point there should be an adjustment made relative to the other known diseases of mass destruction as to the degree of freedom people should have relative to public safety. If there is an imbalance at that point there is more going on than mere health concerns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is:</p>

					<p class="f1 ctr"><b>Vaccination</b></p>

					<p class="f4">The case here is exactly the opposite as for masking. Again the question is: If a vaccine works, then what is the concern over people who do not wish to get vaccinated? You are safe. Your kids are safe from unvaccinated kids.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.7.11.20.2fn1" href="#O.7.11.20.2n1">1</a>]</sup></span> If I want to put myself in danger, or if I see no danger, that is my problem. If it doesn't work then what is the reason for anyone to get vacinated? The 'relative danger' notion does not apply in the case of vaccines.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a huge difference between being told that one must wear a mask to enter a store or join a group activity and being told that one must submit to having a sharp object pierce the skin and load one with a substance one knows nothing about. We can choose to not go out. We can choose: "Give me liberty or give me death!" This is the same problem as with the individual mandate for health insurance. The right to refuse to 'do' is similar to the right to remain silent. As Buddhists we should be allowed to not-do.</p>

					<p class="f4">If we are not allowed this much, we have a case where one must behave very carefully. One may refuse to 'do' without <i>kammic</i> consequences. If physical force is used in an attempt to make one comply, one must neither resist nor comply. The authorities must be made to take all the action. That done carefully, there will be no <i>kammic</i> consequences for the self. Getting angry in a case such as this is counter-productive; dangerous in itself. Destiny has intervened in your life and given you no choice but to risk death for your beliefs. It would come to this one way or another in any case, so just relax and do the rational thing.</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="O.7.11.20.2n1" href="#O.7.11.20.2fn1">1</a>]</sup> The case of children under the age of reason is more complicated, but in terms of the law it has already been decided. The State has declared that it has a vested interest in the welfare of children because that is the supply of future workers who will support the economy and it has for a long time shown that it is ready to use force to attempt to make parents act in accordance with its dictates. The rational thing for a Buddhist concerned with his <i>kamma</i> is to neither resist nor comply. You are not responsible for your children's <i>kamma.</i></p>

					In this sutta the Buddha teaches that there is a misguided way and a high way and that the high way may be undertaken in a low way and a high way depending upon one's point of view, the direction of one's effort and the set of one's mind.<br />
					Each factor of the <i>Magga</i> is, in this description of how to undertake the <i>Dhamma,</i> to be guided by high view, high effort and high mindfulness. These are defined. The Way in this sutta is described as having High knowledge <i>(ñāṇa)</i> and High Freedom <i>(vimutti)</i> as dimensions nine and ten.<br />
					Note in this sutta the definition of <i>'Sammā Diṭṭhi'</i> High View. It is on this sutta that a certain school of Buddhism holds that any effort at accomplishment is mundane practice and that there is nothing to do to attain the super-mundane practice. If they have any logic to their reasoning it is because this so-called supermundane practice is made up entirely of letting go. But letting go is still <i>kamma,</i> action, something to be done and often requires great effort just to get to the point where letting go is possible. I am of the belief that the intent in this sutta was not to suggest two separate paths, but to create awareness that if a practice is pursued with grasping the result will not be the liberation one saught. In practice one will tread both paths, first with grasping and then upon becoming aware of the grasping, with letting go.</p>

					Ānanda explains the extent of what the Buddha meant by the idea of <i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing. It is explained as advancing through the stages to arahantship in each case living in contact with the body and understanding with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here we have a sutta which deals with a phenomena that is important to understand: the fact that <i>Nibbāna</i> can be experienced in this seen thing on a temporary basis prior to arahantship. In the same way as just a finger-snap of not-doing in the face of temptation yields a taste of <i>Nibbāna,</i> so here the achievement of each of the four <i>jhānas</i> and four higher attainments individually yields a temporary taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i> Final achievement of arahantship is had subsequent to the experience of the ending of perception and sense-experience. This is what is meant when the Buddha states that he teaches <i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">The important term to understand here is <i>pariyāyena.</i> I have used 'circumstantial' because of its closeness to the etymology of <i>pariyāya,</i> in its meaning of 'turning about'.<br />
					Hare: "in one particular" "no further particular";<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: "in a provisional sense" "in a non-provisional sense".<br />
					I say: "To the extent that what is experienced is seen as a result of letting go and not doing rather than as a thing that has been got, there is the experience of a taste of <i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing."</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">A Note on <i>Sammā Samādhi</i><br />
					<span class="f3">Relating to Points Made in DN 34,<br />
					Ten by Ten by Ten</span></h4>

					<p class="f4">There are "The Four Types (characteristics of) <i>samādhi,</i> [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.34.olds.bd.htm#p5.7">DN 34.5.7</a>] which includes a <i>samādhi</i> that 'partakes of decline' which I bring up just to push the point that the term <i>'samādhi'</i> is broad and flexible (officially, it encompasses the entire <i>Dhamma,</i> from giving <i>(dana)</i> to detachment <i>(upekkha).</i> And further it is understood to be a thing which is attained by non-Buddhists, in the same way as serenity is not the exclusive property of Buddhists. In other words, it can be worldly and lead to the worldly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further on there is "The Five knowings of <i>sammā-samādhi.</i>" [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.34.olds.bd.htm#p5.8">DN 34.5.8</a>] Firstly this supports my translation of <i>jhāna</i> as 'knowing' (also 'kenning' and 'gnosis'), and looking at the details we find:</p>

					<p class="f4">The five things known in consummate serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">[1] Thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This serenity arises as happiness in the present and will have pleasant results in the future,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">[2] Thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This serenity is Aristocratic, not carnal,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">[3] Thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This serenity is not given flight by a bad person,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">[4] Thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This serenity is tranquil, exalted, has gained repose, reached the development of concentration, and is not own-made — deprecated — objectionable,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">[5] Thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Additionally then, this "I", minding, enters upon this serenity; minding, emerges,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five things should be produced.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are a couple of things in this to note: First is the last where the statement is being made that there is minding in both entering and emerging from <i>jhāna.</i> That is <i>"Samāpajjati"</i> "entering into" and there is no reason to think that this should be understood as 'once entering into the minding stops.' In fact as I read it the idea is that the minding is unbroken from entry to exit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly, there is the statement that <b>'this <i>samādhi</i>' is not own-made <i>(saṅkhāra).</i></b> This is easily mistaken for the statement that the <i>jhāna</i> is not own-made (where we know that right up to the ending of sense-experience and perception the <i>jhānas</i> are own-made, but that is not what it is saying, it is saying that the <i>samādhi</i> that results from <i>jhāna</i> is not own-made. This then describes what I have claimed to be the case with regard to the unseen consciousness <i>(viññāṇa anidassana)</i> that is equal to <i>Nibbāna:</i> that it <i>is</i> conditioned <i>(paccaya)</i> by following the <i>Magga,</i> but that <i>Nibbāna</i> is a secondary product <i>arising from the conditioning,</i> it has arisen without intentional input <i>(saṅkhāra).</i> ... and it has arisen, it is not something that was there that is arrived at.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another thing. Really important. The instructions for attaining the Akincanna Realm, there is an instruction: Thinking: <i>'N'atthi kiñcī' ti</i> "There is nothing there". This is to be taken literally! You are to think the thought: "There is nothing there." Over and over and eventually there will arise the perception that there is nothing there (that is, in the sense of something which is to be had). The power of the word! This is not an instruction to intellectually analyze the physics of nothingness. And this thinking which is word-thought, is described in all cases as occurring after the fourth <i>jhāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case he thinks:</p>

					and I know if it gets established<br />
					it might get worse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, additionally friends,<br />

					<p class="f4">Well then! Let me energize get-up-and-go<br />

					<p class="f4">The various groups of instructions (<i>e.g.,</i> the Way, the Seven Dimensions of Self-Awakening, the lists, numerous individual suttas including the various repetition series, etc. etc.) are called 'Dhammas'. These units of The <i>Dhamma,</i> are like Tinker Toys, or an Erector Set. You put them together to constuct a path (<i>Dhamma</i> Lesson) to the goal suitable for the teaching opportunity. They are mostly constructed so as to encompass each other or equal each other and are spun out or elaborated upon by adding units to deal with the particular orientation of the audience. There are endless combinations. There are suttas where Gotama was teaching enhanced worldly living and attaining such rebirth as ordinary folk yearned for, but these goals were all considered failures relative to the real goal. Gotama appears to have answered almost any question asked of him about almost anything, but when we speak of 'The <i>Dhamma</i>' it is his Teachings that lead to the goal of ending pain or ending <i>kamma</i> or realizing <i>Nibbāna</i> that is intended. A sutta aspiring to be a <i>Dhamma</i> of The <i>Dhamma</i> should always begin, (after setting the scene of the occasion) with the immediate issue that provoked the lesson (that is, at the beginning, or the lowest level) and end at <i>upekkha,</i> detachment leaving the listener only one step to go: Realizing that the freedom of detachment is the freedom one is seeking.</p>

					<p class="f4">You can get an approximation of how this works by playing around with <a href="../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">The Method.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">You can go straight down that page for one construction of the <i>Dhamma</i> that goes from the very beginning of practice to the final goal, or you can take off sideways from any of the links throughout that page and go back and forth for a 'sutta' that will reflect your interest. The sideways links take you to a page that <i>defines</i> the linked term. It isn't an explanation, it is a definition, and it is from the suttas, and is itself a <i>Dhamma,</i> one of the tinker toys. In turn that definition will frequently have in it links to the terms used in the definition, and so on. These <i>Dhammas</i> are generally constructed as heierarchies, so it is possible for someone to construct a sutta to the goal taking these links round and round but higher and higher until you end up at <i>Samma Upekkha</i> on the original front page. "The Method" is by no means complete or constructed consistantly. It would be interesting to see something like this that was. It, like much else on this site, should be seen as a suggestion for some future development.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does this confine the 'Thousand-fold World' to the solar system, implying an overlap or parallel worlds of which we perceive only ours? Perception of the Thousand-fold World is described as like holding a sparkling gem in the palm of one's hand. Multiple-thousand-fold Worlds are described as like holding several such gems. So conceivably the idea was of multiple solar systems each of which was itself a thousand-fold parallel world. This is certainly something that must be seen with the clairvoiant eye and should not be made to fit into, but rather fit around our modern scientific "knowledge." — Just wondering.</p>

					Consummate <i>Samadhi</i> described as consisting of five dimensions (the four usual <i>jhānas</i> and observation of the signs) and yielding skill in the higher knowledges.<br />
					This description of the <i>jhānas</i> has with it the similes which are very helpful in visualizing the progression of the <i>jhānas.</i> [see also for these: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2,</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p39">MN 39,</a><a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77">MN 77</a>] However Hare's translation reflects neither vision nor a close adherence to the <i>Pāḷi</i> and messes up the imagry to the point of uselessness. Hare has especially botched up the simile for the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> and to complicate that, either he has translated it backwards or there was an editorial error which reverses the meaning. The descriptions of the <i>jhānas</i> and the similes that accompany them are not simply descriptions or recipes, they are also hypnotic suggestions which draw one into the <i>jhāna.</i> All their magic is lost if the repeated phrases are not repeated exactly and if the ordering of the words does not reflect the progressive deepening of the experience. See <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#first_burning">'The First Burning'</a> and my version.<br />
					In this sutta the fifth item (observing the signs) is one that is not seen elsewhere connected with <i>sammā samādhi</i> or the mastery of higher powers and its meaning here is subject to question. There is no support in the sutta itself for the idea that this is paying attention to a concentration device, or the so called 'reflex image,' or to the subject of one's meditation. I believe the key is in the simile which is of a man observing another man while standing, observing while standing another man who is sitting, and sitting observing another man who is lying down. I believe what is being observed is the body and its state of serenity and that there is, in the idea of 'a man', a <i>symbolic imagry</i> for mnemonic purposes which is humorous. Note that the final, always the highest state, is supine.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe.</p>

					<p class="f4">One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">His Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"</p>

					<p class="f4">As he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.</p>

					<p class="f4">In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.</p>

					<h1>Milly's Spell</h1>

					<p class="f4">I first saw Milly (aka Mary by the good old Irish cops) after buying a loaf of Black bread at the tiny Russian bakery opposite the police station on 52nd Street between 8th and 9th.</p>

					<p class="f4">She was standing in the middle of the intersection of 52nd and 8th Avenue. Police hat, overcoat (in mid-summer N.Y.), waving the traffic on with one arm while swigging booze from a bottle in the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">I saw her again as she migrated up 8th Avenue to 57th Street.</p>

					<p class="f4">Saw her again during a winter when she resided in the stairwell to the basement of Gristedes (high end grocery store at this time located in the middle of the block, north side).</p>

					<p class="f4">And again at 57th and 9th.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again at 56th and 9th.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again as she turned East into 55th off 9th and took root in the stairwell to the basement of the building across the street opposite my window. Her day job: directing traffic from the middle of the intersection of 55th and 9th.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was already deeply into Buddhism and my thinking was that I should try to live as closely as I could to what I imagined to be the life of the Buddhist Beggar and I found Milly fascinating and a great source of information.</p>

					<p class="f4">One time I was walking past her she was crouching between two parked cars. I was staring. What is she doing there? "What the fuck are you looking at asshole! Can't you see I'm taking a piss." The value of the overcoat (outer robe) as apartment, closet and toilet.</p>

					<p class="f4">One time I saw her being robbed by another street-lady. No fighting, she just calmly stood there and watched as the other lady made off with her possessions. "You shouldn't do that" was all she said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Twice I saw cultivated people who should have known better get into screaming matches with her because she made some remark they found offensive. They couldn't see that they lowered themselves to what they thought of as her level by that.</p>

					<p class="f4">She never lacked for food or booze or money or cloths. People would give her things all the time. Periodically she would disappear for a few days and come back with new second hand clothes from the thrift shop on the corner. I used to bring her my left overs. Lenny would say I was giving her my garbage. He was not quite right. I always separated off what I was to give her before I began to eat, so you could say I shared my meals with her. Occasionally I bought her a whole meal from the Chinese fast-food place next to the A&amp;P. Bought her coffee every morning. But I shied away from taking charge. It was beyond my scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">One truly freezing cold morning when I handed her coffee as she stood in the entry-way to the five and dime on the corner she was so cold the cup slipped right through her fingers. Bobby, the deli-man owner of Pembroke Deli on the corner was so pissed at the refusal of the cops to take her in that he made a complaint so as to get her arrested to get her in from the cold. It was at a time when all the nuts in New York had been removed from the nut-houses and the law stated that they could not be arrested simply for vagrancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was later to see for myself that when you are really down and out some people you thought of as hardasses become kindly and generous. One of the advantages of being a beggar is that you can see the picture in a way that can never be seen by anyone occupying a higher economic level. I noted that the Greeks especially were of this sort: gruf and unpleasant to almost everyone until they perceived you were down and out at which point they seemed like they would give you everything they owned.</p>

					<p class="f4">So one day I have an inspiration. I will save Milly by a spell that will work on her mind and reform her from within! I gave her this carefully hand written with a bic ball-point pen on an old scrap of paper:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">On a One-Way Avenue downtown<br />
							They drive themselves into the ground<br />
							Though I be drunk on a spiritual brew<br />
							With angry downbound ways I'm threw<br />
							Round and round and round and round<br />
							They drive themselves into the ground</p>

					<p class="f4">Milly spent hours scratching. Itch itch scratch scratch. I told her that this problem was solved by Buddhist Beggars by shaving their heads. She shaved her head. But then she immediately let her hair grow back. Clinging to femininity I suppose. More important than comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">One day as she was washing her hair with water from some bottles, I beconed her over to my window and gave her another bottle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later that night as I was sitting in my fly-free chamber (a box covered in photographic rubber matting that allowed in no light in which I used to meditate free of flys and flying free) she approached my window and gave a two-finger whistle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Something took over and I went absolutely still. She knew I was there and I knew she knew and I did not move a muscle.</p>

					<p class="f4">She whistled twice more, then went back to her homestead.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later still I heard a whistle from across the street. And a little later again. And again. And again and again throughout the night.</p>

					<p class="f4">The next morning she was gone. She returned a couple of days later dressed entirely in pink. Pink hat, pink overcoat, pink shirt, pink pants, pink sneekers with pink socks. The ladies at the thrift shop had had a great time.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that I went around to all my neighbors that I knew and told them: "If you want to see Milly for the last time, you had better go see her now."</p>

					<p class="f4">A short while later she was gone for good.</p>

					<p class="f4">I saw her a few weeks later walking between two nuns, well dressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bobby at the deli said she was actually rich and had been taken in by the Nuns.</p>

					<p class="f4">A while later I had been rescued from my own poverty and was living here in California. Watching television one day I see a news program about the homelessness in San Francisco and there is Milly, standing in the middle of the intersection of 55th and 9th, holding up her bottle and waving at me.</p>

					A very rich, complex sutta.

					The Buddha explains in detail the meaning of the statement that all that which is experienced is joined with pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is a sutta which speaks of a gradual, step-wise progression to Arahantship focused on the gradual reduction and final elimination of own-making <i>(saṅkhāra).</i> It also shows that all four <i>jhānas</i> and the <i>arupa</i> attainments are possible to get in a partial (reduced) state and temporarily.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a group of bhikkhus that hold that <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> in the first jhāna should be translated "placing of the mind and keeping it connected")</i> which is not a thing particularly suited to being done partially (in a reduced form) or to being pacified.</p>

					<p class="f4">I wonder why one would go to all the trouble of placing the mind in the first <i>jhāna</i> and then having to get rid of it again for the second <i>jhāna.</i> Such a back-and-forth is not a characteristic of Gotama's style (he prefers "round and round").</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, a characteristic that <i>is</i> Gotama's style is the explanation of terms he uses when doubt is possible: nowhere in the suttas is there an explanation of why what is in every other context clearly properly translated "thinking and pondering" (or some such idea related to thinking) is suddenly to be understood in a completely different way just for the first <i>jhāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I also wonder what happened to the thinking and wandering thoughts that one had while still engaged in the unskillful, just prior to entering the first <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jhana.htm">jhāna.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">These bhikkhus do not see that they are playing a role that supports a (probably brahmin) conspiracy or Buddhaghosa's ignorance (hardly likely when we learn that he burned the originals of the commentaries he was "copying"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.6.04.20fn1" href="#O.6.04.20n1">1</a>]</sup></span> — <i>Buddhaghosuppatti,</i> <i>Pāḷi</i> Text Society, Oxford, 2001, pg 7 and 29) which makes attaining the <i>jhānas</i> impossible (Ok, they say 1 in a million may attain the <i>jhānas,</i> whereas in the suttas the <i>jhānas</i> are to be attained 'easily and without trouble' by ordinary folk including laymen).</p>

					<p class="f4">These bhikkhus are also maintaining a hypocritical stance in that while they advocate following only the Early Buddhist Texts, in this case they are following commentary only. There is no sutta support for this position.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is another inconsistancy in the translation they use <i>saṅkhāra</i> as "conditions" where elsewhere they have vigorously defended the translation as 'choices'. It is clear why the translation is changed here; 'choices' just simply does not work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does they think nobody is watching? That there is no consequence for misrepresenting what the Buddha taught? Especially in such a way as to preclude the attaining of <i>Sammā Samādhi</i> (which they also insist is a prerequisite to attainment of Arahantship).</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="O.6.04.20n1" href="#O.6.04.20fn1">1</a>]</sup> I have spoken in my mind with Buddhaghosa and he earnestly pleads his innocence and I tend to believe him. So he was duped. Maybe his work is even a true copy of the original commentaries. Who knows? We will never know unless some copies escaped the fire. Maybe he had nothing to do with the fire. Maybe it really was an act of blind reverence for Buddhaghosa's work. But somewhere back there somebody did not read that the way to determine the compatability of an idea with the Buddha's <i>Dhamma</i> is to compare that idea with the Buddha's <i>Dhamma.</i> Those who have access to both and have read both and still opt to put faith in the idea that disagrees with the <i>Dhamma</i> have another problem altogether.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I was growing up here in the US, teachers explained the limits of freedom this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your freedom to extend your fist ends with the beginning of my nose."</p>

					<p class="f4">As applied to breaking lock-down of course this is complicated by the piles of mis-information confronting individuals on this subject. I think, however, in the case we have here where an individual can apparently infect others while being symptom-free, the responsibility lies with the individual to determine that he is not infectious. This being nearly impossible for most, the safe bet that covers one's bases is to abide by the rules set out by those in authority; however much one may distrust those authorities and doubt their qualifications to rule, and however much one distrusts the rules themselves even down to near certainty (there is no way of knowing for certain) that they are misguided (maybe they are not). That way the blame falls on them whichever way it works out. If they wasted your time, that falls on them; if they allowed you to break out early and you get infected or infect others, that too falls on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">We're talking about <i>kamma</i> here; what to do or not do to keep from creating a bad <i>kammic</i> result for yourself by what would be intentionally risking the lives of others by not respecting the rules; and the creation of good <i>kamma</i> by the good intent associated with following the rules.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is two different things:<br />
					1. setting up the mind, and<br />
					2. using it once set up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Set up, mind is: A mind that, abiding in a body, sense experience, mental states, or the <i>Dhamma,</i> sees them as they really are (transient, painful and not self) sees how they come to be (as a consequence of thirst), sees how they pass away, and which, so seeing, lives above it all, watchful and dilligent, reviewing and calming down, overcoming any <i>taṇhā</i> that may appear, downbound to nothing at all in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Minding the breaths (a shortcut for saying 'minding the body, sense-experience, mental states and the Dhammma) is abiding in a mind that sees body, sense experience, mental states, and the <i>Dhamma</i> as they really are, sees how they come to be, sees how they pass away, and which, so seeing, lives above it all, watchful and dilligent, reviewing and calming down, overcoming any <i>taṇhā</i> that may appear, downbound to nothing at all in the world.</p>

(I don't know, it still looks to me like there is 'hurry' there and that would indicate desire of some sort; even when responding to a request for a compassionate visit to someone, the Buddha always did so (so we hear) in a very cool, calm, and collected way (finishing his meal, putting his site into order, waiting until the end of the afternoon meditation, etc.). Generally we (I) should not be speculating about other people's attainments though I think there is room for this in the case of doubtful claims to arahantship and when choosing a teacher. In such a case the effort should not be to determine the status of a person, but only to determine if he is <i>not</i> what he claims or is not himself at a level which might be of benefit to oneself. This post was a result of contemplating the purchase of an electric bike for myself to deal with mobility issues and I had concluded that it would reflect grasping as described.</p>

					<p class="f4">A quick note on The Once-Returner. This is not a case where the individual has only one more life to experience before Arahantship. That may be the case (the usual description is that such a one <i>'returns to this world but one more time and there makes an end'</i>), but careful reading shows that this description allows for the case described in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p75">AN 10.75</a> where the Once Returner is first reborn in the Tusita realm. So apparently there may be one or more rebirths in realms other than the <i>manusa</i> realm before one's last rebirth upon returning here.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I am at it I should repeat here what I have mentioned previously concerning the Non-Returner: that is that non-returning is not just a matter of going from death here to one of the Pure Abodes, but the wording: 'going upstream to the Akinittha Realm' can also mean a series (presumably of less than seven) of upwardly situated rebirths culminating in the Akanittha Realm. Non-returning = no turning back.</p>

					<p class="f4">More and more I am being driven to the conclusion that seeking to find a single term for the important concepts in translation of the <i>Pāḷi</i> is not only misguided, but also destructive of the information conveyed by the original.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not in every case, but in a great number of cases (see just <a href="#O.5.8.20.02">below</a>) digging into the meaning of a <i>Pāḷi</i> term will show that it actually encompasses more than one of the shades of meaning supplied by the various possible translations. To choose one narrows the interpretation and in that way legislates against the others to the disadvantage of anyone trying to understand the full scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Translation of the <i>Pāḷi</i> is a sort of arrogance, not just in the assumption the translator makes in thinking he has understood the meaning, but in thinking that (as translators must) one term will do when multiple meanings are actually indicated and helpful (again, as per the example just below) — it is, essentially the statement "our language is superior in its refinement of meaning" wheras it just might be that our language is destructive of thinking in depth.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what is not an elegant solution, the best way around this is probably the very-hard-on-understanding practice of using multiple terms according to context. The danger in that is still the elimination of multiple meanings possible in a single context and the just mentioned difficulty of keeping the various meanings in mind as one reads and puts one's mind to, and thinks about and re-evaluates and reconsiders and ponders and analyzes and keeps at it ... suggesting an alternative that is not pretty:</p>

					<p class="f4">Still a third work-around would be to leave the <i>Pāḷi</i> term untranslated — that is not just difficult-to-translate terms like <i>'Dhamma',</i> but every term with multiple possible good translations. A solution useful to the truly dedicated only!</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Find yourself a place to be alone,<br />
					sit down, sitting up straight,<br />

					<p class="f4">Another solution was proposed by Alex for sites which, unlike this one, allow running scripts: drop down lists of the alternative translations for important terms. Something like the pop up definitions of words now found on several sites, this would have not just one preferred translation, but all the alternatives. A sort of 'make your own translation' tool.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing really one can do about this problem that would yield readable results without completely remaking virtually every sutta we have, but what, as readers we can/should do is keep an open mind about the possibility of an expanded scope versus an alternative meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">The instruction is: <i>sati-parimukham,</i> or <i>parimukham-sati.</i><br />
					This means: "Mind-around-mouth."<br />
					It also means: "Mind-around-face."<br />
					It also means: "Mind around the front."<br />
					It also means: "Mind around the interface" [between the personal and the external].<br />
					It also has been interpreted as meaning: "Mind the business at which you are about" (that is minding).</p>

					<p class="f4">This instruction is found in cases where a formula for meditation is being set forth, not exclusive to minding the in and out breaths.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no instruction that reads: 'focus where the breath is felt' or 'at the nose' or at any specific place. Try to focus on the point where the breath passes the nostrils you will quickly see that you cannot find that place. It moves around at light-speed!</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the instruction reads "around" <i>(pari).</i> The point is the focus, not the locus.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is also important as a preventive measure: our job here is not to maintain a state of concentration on any one object. We are trying to develop concentration (or better, focus) as a skill, a tool to be used in understanding other things. You are not going to <i>Nibbāna</i> with your mind focused on your nose!</p>

					<p class="f4">Follow the instructions without trying to pick it apart and you will see the advantages of minding around the mouth as a starting point, minding the face as a matter of minding the sense-reactions, minding the front as minding the whole body, minding the interface as minding the inter-relations of the body and the external world, and minding your business as keeping you focused on the task. Round and round, up and down, back and forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is uncertainty and confusion concerning the meaning of the term <i>'Gandhabba'.</i> I suggest that without knowing the origin of the term or even its meaning, a place to look to understand the idea is within: the <i>gandhabba</i> is the individuality, the personality of the being seeking to be born upon the conjunction of the male and female: that's you Bub! For me this is a clear statement that there is a state, at least for some forms of rebirth, between death and rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Speed of Light: 299,792,458 miles/second. I wonder if anyone has tried to measure the speed of consciousness. I wonder if science is not missing something by not considering consciousness as an element when they speak of the speed of light being the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter and information can travel. Leaving aside  the idea that they are speaking of the speed at which  'conventinal matter' can travel, I see the situation where an Arahant could (and as reported in the suttas, does) switch awareness of one state of sense-consciousness identified with a certain individuality in one location to awareness of another state of sense-consciousness identified with the same individuality in another location or multiple locations at the speed of thought and without loss of memory. So though conventional matter may not be able to travel at this speed, the illusion of matter may. "From being one, he becomes many, from being many he becomes one." "Dissapearing from here, he re-appears there." The trick, it seems, is letting go of the idea that there is any material reality to 'conventional matter'.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this essay Bhante Thanissaro argues that it is a mistake to conceptualize the method as being one where there is no need for taking action, that is, that it requires only 'doing nothing'. The idea that there is nothing one needs to do and that Arahantship arrives on its own in its own good time is approximately the 'theory of non-action' and is a wrong method and is highly criticized by the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the possibility of mistaking this wrong stand as the one suggested here, I hasten to clarify that 'doing nothing' is not the method suggested here.</p>

					<p class="f4">The method suggested here strongly emphasizes the idea of 'intentional not-doing' the <i>kamma</i> that ends <i>kamma,</i> in combination with 'letting go', <i>(nekkhamma).</i> The difference is critical.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The Crossroads<br />
					<span class="f3"><i>Cātu-m-Mahā-Pathe</i></span></h4>

					<p class="f4">Here and there throughout the suttas you will come across this business of a crossroads.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does this stand for?</p>

					<p class="f4">It stands for the point where the Four Great Elements (<i>paṭhavi</i>/earth/solidity, <i>āpo</i>/water/liquidity, <i>tejo</i>/firelight/combustion, and <i>vayo</i>/wind/motion) meet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that stands for this living being made up from the four.</p>

					<p class="f4">One term of the four is most helpful for 'seeing' this: <i>tejo:</i> combustion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sitting, sitting up straight and bringing the mind to the mouth and then, when still, calm and tranquil, looking down at the body in the mind's eye, you will see the body as faint (usually) quavering outline in light (or, if you have developed a 'center' as <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/whats.new.2019.htm#O.3.8.19.2">suggested,</a> you may just see a line, or a smudge, or even, possibly just a point of light. Look again and you will see that it bears every resemblance to a fire whose flames are formed creations. Creations appear to be 'spewing' out from that light. The more active you get, the greater the breadth and visibility of the flames to the point where it is this efflouresence of forms that is what one takes for 'my body' 'my world'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is more than an interesting illusion. One of the more difficult problems we face in attaining freedom is attaining freedom from the body. While it is not easy to see the solidity, liquidity and motion of the body in this detached way (as opposed to the normal composit view of a 'whole' body that is seen as 'my body') but what is happening with the element of combustion is much easier to see objectively (or you might say 'down to its point of origin') and because of that is very helpful to the effort to detach.</p>

					of intent,<br />

					<p class="f4">Taking this as his stand<br />

					<p class="f4">Blindness<br />

					<p class="f4">There are several variations on the formula for the First <i>Jhāna</i> to be found on this site; today I would translate the formula as follows:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Separated from<br />
							sensuality<br />
							separated from<br />
							unskillful things,<br />
							still re-thinking,<br />
							still re-evaluating,<br />
							appreciating the pleasure born of separation,<br />
							enter<br />
							and make a habitat of<br />
							the First Gnosis.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Vivicca:</i> 'Separated from', 'divorced from', 'aloof from', 'having put away', 'secluded from'. All these are good. What is not good is any word indicating suppression. Suppression requires continued contact and what we are after here is no contact at all.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Kāmehi:</i> Sensual desires; sensuality; thinking erotic thoughts, but also any thoughts of a similar nature implying indulgence in sense pleasures as in fantasizing about lunch. Unless you have practiced that it be otherwise you resort to lustful thoughts about every 29 seconds all day every day. Not a skillful use of Time.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Akusalehi dhammehi:</i> unskillful things. At the very moment when you sit down, your intent goes from indulgence in the unskillful to attention to the skillful. That, along with an appreciation of the advantages of solitude, is, in essence, the entry to the First <i>Jhāna.</i> But do not make the mistake of thinking that you have 'got' the First <i>Jhāna</i> or that that is all there is to it. The First <i>Jhāna</i> is not 'got', what you have got is a good example of the method: progress is made in this system by abandoning <i>(nekkhamma)</i> — the first principle: <i>saṅkappa.</i> The First <i>Jhāna</i> is what you have left after abandoning unskillful things. It is here, in this state that one does ones <i>Dhamma Vicaya;</i> research into the way things really are; <i>yoniso manasikara:</i> tracing things back to their point of origin; <i>Dhamma</i> re-evaluation; re-evaluation of your ethical standards and all the other problems associated with the discrepancy between your self subject to pain and freedom of mind. Attend to these things before you even think about 'getting' the second <i>jhāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There are those who say there is no 'thinking' in the <i>jhānas.</i> So they condemn those who follow this notion to doing all their <i>Dhamma Vicaya</i> in the unskillful state of worldly consciousness. That this could result in clear thinking is not reasonable.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sa-vitakka: Sa</i> = 'with'; <i>takka</i> = thinking. Push it a little and I think that 'still' could be found in <i>'sa';</i> but the point is that 'with' means that while prior to sitting you were thinking, now in this first <i>jhāna</i> you are still thinking. The only difference being that the thinking now is skillful where previously it was unskillful.</p>

					<p class="f4">On re-thinking: thoughts arise from the outside as incomplete fragments; when you string them together in mind to make a coherent thought, it is re-thinking. But because we USAmericans have not, as a people placed much value on our minds, we do not have words that as precisely as this describe what is really happening, that is, that the process of thinking is a matter of repeatedly bringing to mind and arranging and re-arranging perceptions or fragmentary thoughts to form coherent (at least to some) thoughts and (all too often) subsequent speech.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sa-vicāraṃ</i> With Re-Evaluation. Pondering. <i>'Cāra'</i> has the sense of lifting up and moving around with setting down implied but not in the word. Once a re-thought thought has been coherently formed, it is then reviewed and evaluated and altered to fit the inquiry. 'Turning over in the mind' is another way of saying the same thing. What was wanted here was a word that had in it the idea that this too was a thing that was done and redone again and again in the mind. Otherwise 'pondering' would also do. [I note that 'evaluation' is <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's translation. No doubt I unconsciously picked this up from him ... but this is one of our objectives, no? To arrive at a vocabulary that those knowledgable in the <i>Dhamma</i> all agree on.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Viveka-jaṃ pīti-sukhaṃ</i> This is the appreciation of the peace and quiet that comes from being alone for a good spell. <i>Viveka-jam:</i> separation-born; <i>pīti:</i> appreciation; <i>sukhaṃ:</i> pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Upa-sampajja:</i> Rise up into; <i>vihārati:</i> abide in, live in, inhabit, make a habit of.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Paṭhamaṃ: the first; <i>jhānaṃ:</i> knowing, gnosis.</i></p>

							<p class="fp4 in2"><i>Vivicca||<br />
							kāmehi||<br />
							vivicca||<br />
							akusalehi dhammehi||<br />
							sa-vitakkaṃ||<br />
							sa-vicāraṃ||<br />
							viveka-jaṃ pīti-sukhaṃ||<br />
							paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upa-sampajja vihārati.</i>|| ||</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Thanissaro, in his translation of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.014.than.ati.htm#n5"><i>MN</i> 14, note 5,</a> says, in reference to the statement in that sutta:</p>

					      <p class="in2">"Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta ... has told us, "Nigaṇṭhas, there are evil actions that you have done in the past.</p>

					      <p class="in2">Exhaust them with these painful austerities.</p>

					      <p class="in2">When in the present you are restrained in body, restrained in speech, and restrained in mind, that is the non-doing of evil action for the future.</p>

					      <p class="in2">Thus, with the destruction of old actions through asceticism, and with the non-doing of new actions, there will be no flow into the future.</p>

					      <p class="in2">With no flow into the future, there is the ending of action.</p>

					      <p class="in2">With the ending of action, the ending of stress.</p>

					      <p class="in2">With the ending of stress, the ending of feeling.</p>

					      <p class="in2">With the ending of feeling, all suffering and stress will be exhausted."</p>

					<p><i>"One of the great ironies in the history of Buddhism is the extent to which teachings that the Buddha clearly disapproved of, such as this one, have later been taught as quintessentially Buddhist. In some circles, a teaching similar to this one — that non-reactivity to pain burns away the impurity of past <i>kamma</i> and creates no new <i>kamma</i> for the future — is still taught as Buddhist to this day."</i></p>

					<p class="f4">First of all the statement that "non-reactivity to pain burns away the impurity of past <i>kamma</i> and creates no new <i>kamma</i> for the future" is not even what Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta is saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro does not give us the exact wording of the "teaching similar to this one" so we have no basis for comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now here on this site the statement that could, for a careless ear, be heard as 'similar to this' is made thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Practice non-reaction to the thirst <i>(taṇhā)</i> that results from sense experience created by past <i>kamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">Practice 'response' in its place.</p>

					<p class="f4">What response?</p>

					<p class="f4">Intentionally not reacting.</p>

					<p class="f4">When in the present you are<br />
					restrained in body,<br />
					restrained in speech,<br />
					and restrained in mind,<br />
					that is the non-doing of evil action for the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, with the destruction of old actions through non-reaction,<br />
					and with the non-doing of new unskillful (unrestrained) actions,<br />
					there will be no <i>kammic</i> flow into the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">No <i>kammic</i> flow into the future is the ending of <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">With the ending of <i>kamma,</i><br />
					the ending of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not certain that <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro had this site in mind, but it comes close enough that an ... um ... response seemed advisable for the sake of clarity.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the <i>Dhamma</i> is telling us that we should hear,<br />
					when you hear<br />
					"<i>Appamāda</i> means 'Non-Carelessness', or<br />
					'without carelessness'"<br />
					is <i>not</i>
					"Be Careful", or<br />
					"Dilligence", or<br />
					"Heedfulness",<br />
					but
					"Be on the watch-out for Carelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Its a matter of the direction of your focus. If you saw the world as it really is, you would know that being careful is the natural state and that it is corrupted from without by and as a result of carelessness. So you don't want to be worrying about being careful where you are already being careful which is what you would be doing if you understood <i>appamāda</i> to be telling you to be careful; you want to be paying attention to those signs that indicate that you might be slipping into carelessness. That is why this word is given so much importance in the <i>Suttas.</i></p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>Now I have a good one for you. Give Ear!:</p>

					<p class="f4">Remourse and self-recrimination<br />
					over some past deed poorly done<br />
					is itself bad <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">How so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Its the difference between<br />
					passively experiencing and active doing:<br />
					self-recrimination is an active doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Punishing yourself by self-recrimination is taking on a role somewhat beyond your standing in the matter. ... and it isn't going to let you off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Active doing is <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Sucha one is making himself feel bad<br />
					about an anticipated unpleasant sensation, or<br />
					about having experienced an unpleasant sensation, or<br />
					about experiencing an unpleasant sensation<br />
					thus capitalizing on the old <i>kamma</i> to create new experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the whole of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as two persons<br />
					who act in the same shameful way<br />
					intending to cause pain;<br />
					both will experience painful experience<br />
					in proportion to the intent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one experiences the unpleasant sensatins<br />
					and "feels guilty"<br />
					is ashamed,<br />
					heaps abuse upon himself,<br />
					etc., etc., etc.;<br />
					the other understands <i>kamma</i><br />
					experiences the unpleasant sensations,<br />
					and sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the consequence<br />

					<p class="f4">In the case of the translation of <i>Pāḷi</i> negative opposites, we need to remember that a fundamental principle in this system is intentional not-doing.

					<p class="f4">Whatever the reality of the Covid-19 virus outbreak turns out to be, what we can see is that it has given a good scare to virtually everyone on the planet that has access to news. For the first time, for many, this will be an up-close look at how they feel about death. A true 'wake up' call. There is the possibility that for some who would not have done so naturally, this scare may turn them to an examination of their beliefs and readyness for the world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I am dealing with a worldly matter, let me also put foreward a thought on the business much in discussion today of income inequality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Naturally today the focus is on exactly the wrong aspect of this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">For me this needs to be seen from two aspects: The righteousness of earning huge amounts of money, and the righteousness of the playing field.</p>

					<p class="f4">As far as Buddhist doctrines are concerned they are based on the idea of <i>kamma.</i> There is no fault in an individual based strictly on the amount of money they amass or how rapidly they amass it, as long as it is done honestly. Wealth in this system is a result of generosity in the past. To say that earning huge amounts of money was in some way immoral is to point to a morality that is not based on the Buddhist understanding of <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand, we need to ask: How is the capitalist system any different than the feudal one? In stead of kings of states; we have CEOs. In stead of Lords, we have VPs and Department Heads. Such an organization is not based on <i>kamma</i> or on the reality of the situation, but on privilage and arbitrary favoritism.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I have personally heard multi-centi-millionairs state that they earned it all themselves and owe their success strictly to their own efforts. But this is an absurd opinion. I suggest that the expression "ideas are a dime a dozen" points to the reality: ideas, (the basis for the boss justifying his disproportinately large salary) without support from the infrastructure paid for by the people in the past, financing, and competant co-workers, nothing new would get off the ground. It is to the organization of the playing field: the rules set up by the government and the structure of the distribution of earned income within the corporation that needs to be the focus of the concern for equitable income distribution.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because the idea of <i>kamma</i> has not been introduced into this dialog that the same battle has been faught since the world began: back and forth, round and round. The terminology of the debate needs to be upgraded.</p>

					<p>My say.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) All things which have been brought together, made up, by pre-existing causes, forms, the world of phenomena, <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.15.020.pali.bd.htm#pg193"><i>S.</i> ii. 193;</a> <i>Dhp.</i> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v255">255,</a> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v278">278.</a></p>

Essential conditions, antecedents or synergy (co-ordinated activity), requisite for act, speech, thought: <i>kāyas,</i> <a id="pg28"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span></a> <i>vacīs, cittas,</i> or <i>mānos,</i> described respectively as 'respiration,' 'attention and consideration,' 'percepts and feelings,' 'because these are (respectively) bound up with,' or 'precede' those, <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.044.pali.bd.htm#pg301">M. i. 301</a> (<i>cf.</i> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.010.pali.bd.htm#pg56">56</a>); <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_41_cittasamyutta.htm#p6">S. iv. 293.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">(3) One of the five <i>khandhas,</i> or aggregates of the constituents of organic life (see <i>khandha</i>), comprising all the <i>citta-sampayutta-cetasika Dhamma — i.e.,</i> the mental concomitants, or adjuncts, which come, or tend to come, into consciousness at the uprising of a <i>citta,</i> or unit of cognition, Dhs. 1 (<i>cf.</i> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p111">M. iii. 25</a>); Abh.S. ch. ii. As thus classified, the <i>saṅkhāra's</i> form the mental factor corresponding to the bodily aggregate, or <i>rūpa-k-khandha,</i> and are in contrast to the three <i>khandhas</i> representing a single mental function only. But just as <i>kāya</i> stands for both <i>body</i> and <i>action,</i> so do the concrete mental syntheses called <i>saṅkhārā</i> tend to take on the implication of <i>synergies,</i> of purposive intellection, connoted by the term <i>abhisaṅkhāra, q.v. — e.g.,</i> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p120">M. iii. 99 <i>f.,</i></a> where <i>saṅkhārā</i> are a purposive, aspiring state of mind to induce a specific rebirth; <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.051.pali.bd.htm#pg82">S. ii. 82,</a> where <i>puññaṃ, apuññaṃ, āṇeñjaṃ saṅkhāra abhi-saṅkharoti,</i> is, in Vibh. 135, catalogued as the three classes of <i>abhisaṅkhāra;</i> S. ii. <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.025.pali.bd.htm#pg39">39,</a> 360; <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p171"><i>A.</i> ii. 157,</a> where <i>saṅkhāra</i> is tantamount to <i>sañcetanā;</i> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm">Mil.</a> 61, where <i>saṅkhāra,</i> as <i>khandha,</i> is replaced by <i>cetana</i> (purposive conception). Thus, too, the <i>saṅkhāras</i> in the <i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i> formula are considered as the aggregate of mental conditions which, under the law of <i>kamma,</i> bring about the inception of the <i>paṭi-sandhi-viññāṇa,</i> or first stirring of mental life in a newly begun individual. Lists of the psychologically, or logically distinguishable factors making up the composite <i>saṅkhāra-k-khandha,</i> with constants and variants, are given for each class of <i>citta</i> in Dh.S. 62, etc. (<i>N.B.</i> — Read <i>cetanā</i> for <i>vedanā,</i> § 338.) <i>Phassa</i> and <i>cetana</i> are the two constant factors in the <i>saṅkhāra-k-khandha.</i> These lists may be compared with the later elaboration of the <i>saṅkhāra</i>-elements given in Vis.

					<h4 class="ctr">In the Beginning<br />
					was also<br />
					The Word*</h4>

					<p class="f4">In <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.15.olds.bd.htm#extent"><i>DN</i> 15,</a> we are told that<br />
					<b>named-forms depend on consciousness<br />
					and that consciousness depends on named-forms.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">There are implications.</p>

					<p class="f4">[<b>1</b>] The logical inference is,<br />
					that in this ever-revolving evolving devolving world<br />
					the occasion of<br />
					<b>the appearance of formed objects <i>(rūpa)</i><br />
					occurs symultaneously with<br />
					the origin of consciousness <i>(viññāṇā)</i> of their identity <i>(nāma).</i></b></p>

					<p class="f4">If we bend the theorizing of our modern scientists, we might say that every entry of a new existing thing is a mini- big bang. So this is saying that <b>as well as the material universe as it re-evolves being created by a big bang, so is consciouosness.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">To see this you need to divorce yourself from the notion that consciousness is something unique to your brain, or a thing that arises and evolves only within the already existing being or world. In this system <b>consciousness is like an element.</b> Sense-consciousness is a property that naturally arises at the time of the formation of existing beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">[<b>2</b>] As the world of objects evolves,<br />
					so also does the scope of sense-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">From raw consciousness of elementary forms, consciousness evolves — consciousness of consciousness building on itself forming ideas and opinions into a mind that experiences <i>(vedana)</i> and reacts <i>(upadāna)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here one might say that individuality was a product of consciousness building on consciousness to such an extent that it has lost consciousness of (has forgotten) its origins as element and has become fooled into belief that it has a unique existence as a being. We can call this 'Original Blindness'.</p>

					<p class="f4">[<b>3</b>] Now it may be that someone here, having become aware of the disadvantages of existing, sits down to work out some escape from this world of pain and so works his concentration that he tracks his consciousness back to the point where the process itself is visible. If this is a real phenomena, it is visible. Why would it not be visible?</p>

					<p class="f4">What does he see?</p>

					<p class="f4">He sees things appearing in his world simultaneously with his consciousness of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As things do not pop into existence wholly formed from zip nada, but individually evolve into existence, there is at this point the perception that things are 'thought into existence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And who is the thinker?</p>

					<p class="f4">Without seeing and understanding the Buddha's doctrine that there is no thing there that is the self of you, the appearance of things will force the conclusion that you are the Creator of the Created (<i>i.e.,</i> Pajapati, <i>i.e.,</i> God).</p>

					<p class="f4">This perception — that one is one's self thinking things into existence has implications.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Creator is also responsible for the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">That which comes into existence will also pass from existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">The problem faced by the Creator of the Created is the dilemma: "Do I continue to exist and enjoy the pleasures of the senses but also create this massive bad <i>kamma,</i> or do I not create the world and end up being the only "real" person in the universe?"</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>What are you going to do?</b></h4>

					<p class="f4">The solution is to get rid of this blind view by replacing it with a higher view, that is, seeing that:<br />
					consciousness of named-forms is transient,<br />
					that which is transient is painful,<br />
					that which is painful<br />
					is not well seen as<br />
					'this is me',<br />
					'this is my self',<br />
					'this is a part of me', or<br />
					'I am a part of this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In other words, the error there is the assumption that the self exists, is "real".</p>

					<p class="f4">In bringing your mind to perception (seeing) at this level the evolutionary process that resulted in the original experience of individuality is turned onto itself and set to the task of perceiving the real state of affairs and the escape therefrom in dropping the blind point of view which is causing the problem.</p>

					<p class="f4">From perception of the problem and the solution there follows the process of detachment <i>(upekkha).</i> This process consists of two methods: the letting go and not-doing described in the <i>Magga.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go and not doing being the mechanism of action used to effect detachment, the result is not something made by identification with the intent to create personal experience through acts of thought, word, and deed (<i>i.e., saṅkhāra-ṃ</i>-ming); the result is not a mind that already existed — though it looks like a sort of reversion to the original state of the mind, it is not that, it has evolved — it evolves from the state of identified-with existence (individuality) to a state where there is no identification with the existing. But it is consciousness. It is consciousness of not being identified with consciousness of named forms. It is the beam of sunshine that passing through the window of the West wall and not finding an East wall or a floor or the ground or the turtle, rests on and is fed by nothing but its own freedom from attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a one, so seeing,<br />
					recognizing in this freedom the freedom from pain one has been seeking, can see:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Left behind is rebirth,<br />
					the life of being God,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more for me is there a hither and further,<br />
					no more is there for me this it'n-'n-at'n."</p>

					<p>Say I.</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p class="f4">*I say: "In the beginning <i>is</i> the <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/adams_apple/old_pali/a.htm">A</a>" You want to see this for yourself as opposed to reading this here and forgetting about it in the next minute, give the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p1">Sabba-Dhamma Mūla Pariyāya Sutta</a> some serious thought (I mean weeks, months, years of concentrated study!).

					"The <i>Jātaka</i> commentary in numerous passages states that the four <i>Brahmā vihāras</i> were practised, long before the time of the rise of Buddhism, by the sages of old. I have not found such a statement in the <i>Nikāyas;</i> and it is most probable therefore that the <i>Jātaka</i> commentator is ante-dating the particular meditations in question. However this may be, they remained, throughout the long history of Buddhism, an essential part of Buddhist practice. They are even mentioned in the <i>Jātaka Mālā,</i> a work usually supposed to be Mahāyānist, and dated about a thousand years later than the Buddha."</p>

					This <i>Suttanta</i> leads up only to the four states of mind held to result, after death, in a rebirth in the heavenly worlds of Brahmā. If you want union with <i>Brahmā</i> — which is not the Buddhist goal — this is the way to attain to it.<br />
					This is an adaptation! It took all of half a day to re-work Rhys Davids' translation such that it comports with the preferred vocabulary used here. It seems to me that if a uniform-vocabulary translation of the suttas turns out to be a desirable thing (I have my doubts, and have abandoned my previous position in favor of such a thing) it would be relatively simple to construct in this way.</p>

					Alvin Toffler, Random House, N.Y., 1970.</p>

					<p class="f4">Relevance: Transience. I thought this would throw some light on <i>anicca.</i> It does, but, of course what he is dealing with is worldly transience. His proposition is that the new technoligies emerging in the world speed up transience and this will result in mass disorientation. The first half of the book is very informative in its discussion of the areas where technology will cause disruption. The book was 50 years ahead of its time and is required reading for anyone who has the feeling that the insanity here today is more than the usual older generation viewing the younger generation as more corrupt than they were and who wishes to understand what happened/is happening. The second half of the book is useless predictions and methods for counter-acting the damage of transience. Interesting because most of the predictions and methods suggested for coping were tried and failed.</p>

					<p>All the world’s a stage,<br />
					And all the men and women merely players;<br />
					They have their exits and their entrances,<br />
					And one man in his time plays many parts,<br />
					His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br />
					Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;<br />
					And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br />
					And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br />
					Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br />
					Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br />
					Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br />
					Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,<br />
					Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br />
					Seeking the bubble reputation<br />
					Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br />
					In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br />
					With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br />
					Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br />
					And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br />
					Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br />
					With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br />
					His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br />
					For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br />
					Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br />
					And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br />
					That ends this strange eventful history,<br />
					Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br />
					Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tip: When working on letting go relative to the body, remember that the job is not to relax, but to let go of tensions. Tension is a muscle contraction which has past its point of usefulness. You want to let go of all tensions; if you tried to relax all flexed muscles in the body (which is impossible), you would end up like a plate of spaghetti. The danger here is that you can spend considerable time relaxing this muscle, then that, only after a time noticing that you have been going round and round in a circle, not relieving tensions at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tip: If you are going to use the <i>Dhamma</i> to inform your practice (as opposed to simply following some teacher's guidance), then it becomes very helpful to do your own translations. This does not have to be polished work. The point is the bearing down on, concentration on the <i>Dhamma</i> (the lesson) within the <i>Dhamma</i> (the instruction). You may not be aware of it, but things change extremely rapidly in our world today and our minds have (or are attempting to) adopt by speeding up and cutting corners, especially when we read. In this is the danger of mentally editing what you are reading such as to form an impression of the lesson which agrees with your pre-conceived notions. If your pre-conceived notions were worth their salt, you would not be in the mess you are in. So you need to open yourself to the possibility that you may have to think through a statement that contradicts a long-cherished belief. That opening to the possibility of new understanding is greatly facilitated by the pondering one must do in translation.</p>

					The Four Nikāyas<br />
					<span class="f2">E-pub, Azw, Mobi, and PDF formats</span></h4>

					<p class="f4">Free downloads of the PTS translations of the Four Nikāyas have just been announced by Bhante <i>Bhikkhu</i> Subhuti on his website: <a href="https://americanmonk.org/free-pts-sutta-ebooks/">americanmonk.org</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Please note that this is not a project of BuddhaDust and these publications are not being hosted on this site. These books have been compiled and re-formatted from our as yet [Monday, December 30, 2019 8:15 AM] incompletely proofed html source files by Bhante <i>Bhikkhu</i> Subhuti and Stephen J. Torrence. Some additional editing for spelling has been done by them. Although there remain errors related to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the original scanned books as well as errors made by me in the haste to get 'something' on line, it was felt by Bhante Subhuti that these files were good enough for release in their current state. There are plans to periodically update these books as editing of the source files continues.</p>

					<p class="f4">Meanwhile this will be, for many people, a more convenient and pleasurable way to read the suttas.</p>

					<p class="f4">To insure that you are downloading the latest version, please downlad from <a href="https://americanmonk.org/free-pts-sutta-ebooks/">americanmonk.org</a></p>

					<p class="f4">I see the release of these e-books, however much they can be improved, as a small miracle. The <i>Dhamma</i> as propagated itself! This is exactly what I would have hoped would happen with the digitization of these suttas. Here is a quick list of some other projects people might find interesting to compile into e-book formats:</p>

					<p class="f4">Healthcare and the Medical Professions;<br />
					Politics;<br />
					Managing Business and Money Management;<br />
					The story of Rahula;<br />
					The story of Migara's Mother;<br />
					The story of Angulimala;<br />
					The story of King Pasanadi;<br />
					The story of Gotama through the suttas;<br />
					The important topics of the <i>Saṃyutta Nikāya</i> could be made into separate books including suttas on the same subject from all the other <i>Nikāyas.</i><br />
					a collection of all the similes plus their explanations;<br />
					a listing/index (linked), in chronological order, of all the suttas (I believe this information can be gathered from the commentaries),<br />
					and whatever other subjects that are of interest to narow groups.</p>
