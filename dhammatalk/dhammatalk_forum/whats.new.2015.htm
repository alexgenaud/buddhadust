What the next generation has here, and this is my gift, is something to work with. I was in the unique position of having the resources in terms of computer hardware, the full sets of all the books involved, long familiarity with all the translations and the <i>Pāḷi</i> and Time. I saw no one else with this combination of assets and so took on the job. It was horrible drugery mixed with some wonderfully magical moments, but way too much pressure to be really enjoyable and with the result that there are a million small errors and perhaps some large ones; not everything has been fully expanded; not all the <i>Pāḷi</i> text has gotten any farther than the upload of the BJT version; some alternative translations have not yet been formatted. These things, and the addition of supplementary works will proceed on a much more relaxed basis. This was the most astounding supplement to my education that I could ever have hoped for. This reward was worth the effort.</p>

					The Buddha gives the <i>bhikkhus</i> a course leading to <i>Nibbāna</i> by way of contrasting the attitudes of the good man and the not so good man to each stage of the process.<br />
					This course leads from various low level practices through the <i>jhānas</i> all the way to neither perceiving nor non-perceiving showing that in each case a person can be off track if they hold themselves above others for their accomplishment. It is in each case pointed out that the essential thing in the practice is the gettiing rid of thirst <i>(taṇha).</i><br />
					An important idea to understand in this sutta is the <i>Pāḷi</i>: (about whichever <i>jhāna</i> is being spoken of:) <i>pi kho atammayatā vuttā Bhagavatā;<br />
					yena yena hi maññanti tato taṃ hoti aññathā ti.</i><br />
					Horner: "Lack of desire, even for the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception has been spoken of by the Lord; for whatever they imagine it to be, it is otherwise."<br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro: "The Blessed One has spoken of non-fashioning even with regard to the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, for by whatever means they construe it, it becomes otherwise from that."<br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro notes: "In other words, whatever the condition of the ground on which one might base a state of becoming — a sense of one's self or the world one inhabits — by the time that state of becoming has taken shape, the ground has already changed. In this case, if one tries to shape a sense of self around one's attainment of <i>jhāna,</i> the attainment itself has already changed."<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: "Non-identification even with the attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-percetion has been declared by the Blessed One; for in whatever way the conceive, the fact is ever other than that."<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi notes: <i>MA</i> explains "non-identification" (<i>atammayatā,</i> lit. "not-consisting of that") as the absence of craving. However, the context suggests that the absence of conceit may be the meaning. The statement "for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than that" <i>(yena yena hi maññanti tato taṃ hoti aññathā)</i> is a philosophical riddle appearing also as <i>Sn</i> 588, <i>Sn</i> 757, and <i>Ud</i> 3:10. Though <i>MA</i> is silent, the <i>Udāna</i> commentary explains it to mean that in whatever way worldly people conceive any of the five aggregates - as self or self's belonging, etc. - the thing conceived turns out to be other than the aspect ascribed to it: it is not self or self's belonging, not "I" or "mine"<br />
					MO: The not so good man exalts himself for attaining the <i>jhāna,</i> but the good man thinks: <i>"(This jhāna) indeed, says Bhagava, is just not made like that - for anyone whoever that so thinks has by that got some other thing.</i><br />
					In other words attaining <i>jhāna</i> is incompatible with such thoughts as 'I am better than' which reflect thirst <i>(taṇhā)</i>. You cannot get what is got by letting go by way of grasping after it, and a person who thinks that attaining such is something that makes him superior to others is by definition grasping after that attainment and so could not have got it or if they had got it once would because of that grasping not be able to get it again so their basis for pride in their attainment is lost. This my reading.<br />

					The Buddha delivers three discourses in brief on the subject of how to judge whether or not something should be done or used or practiced or associated with. In each case Sariputta expands the brief discussion in detail and the Buddha confirms Sariputtas analysis.<br />
					Here, in the unabridged version we see the way the teaching was likely conducted. Not only does Sariputta expand the teaching in brief of the Buddha, but the Buddha then repeats what Sariputta has said, so the <i>bhikkhus</i> end up having heard the lesson three times.<br />
					Nit: Ms. Horner has translated <i>'vitthārena'</i> as 'in full' but logic and tradition has it that the Buddha always speaks 'in brief'. However lengthy a discourse may be, by the nature of the interlinking of doctrines it can be expanded limitlessly (see <a href="../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">The Method</a> on this site for an example of how this works), so that there is never any teaching 'in full'. Bhk. Bodhi has 'in detail'.<br />

					The Buddha defines what it is that makes a person wise.<br />
					The term 'element' here, used by Ms. Horner as well as Bhk. Bodhi and others, should be understood as meaning not 'an element' as from the periodic table, but 'a constituent part'.</p>

					The Buddha sings the praises of a number of <i>paccekabuddhas.</i><br />
					This is a very old form of poetry. It consists, with a side-note her and there, of a list of ancient heros (seers) who were <i>paccekabuddhas.</i> The <i>paccekabuddha</i> is an individual who became <i>arahant</i> without the aid of the <i>Dhamma</i> of a Buddha. <i>Paccekabuddha,</i> is often translated 'silent buddhas' and such are said to not teach. Since there are stories here and there showing that a <i>paccekabuddha</i> did teach, the better understanding is that these individuals had neither the training or the inclination to teach and lacked the charisma to lead groups.<br />

					In this sutta the Buddha teaches that there is a misguided way and a high way and that the high way may be undertaken in a low way and a high way depending upon one's point of view, the direction of one's effort and the set of one's mind.<br />
					Each factor of the <i>Magga</i> is, in this description of how to undertake the <i>Dhamma,</i> to be guided by high view, high effort and high mindfulness. These are defined. The Way in this sutta is described as having High knowledge <i>(ñāṇa)</i> and High Freedom <i>(vimutti)</i> as dimensions nine and ten.<br />

He provides four similes to illustrate this point: trying to get oil by pressing sand, trying to get milk by pulling a bull's horn, trying to get butter by churning water, and trying to light a fire with a wet sappy stick.<br />

					The Buddha explains the workings of <i>kamma:</i> good deeds produce good results, bad deeds produce bad results in spite of cases where this law does not appear to be working.<br />
					From the introduction by <i>Bhikkhu</i> Khantipalo to the Ñanamoli Thera translation:<br />
					<i>"The Buddha ... shows how wrong views can arise from only partial understanding of truth. One can see the stages of this: (1) a mystic "sees" in vision an evil-doer suffering in hell, (2) this confirms what he had heard about moral causality, (3) so he says, "evil-doers always go to hell," and (4) dogma hardens and becomes rigid when he says (with the dogmatists of all ages and places), "Only this is true; anything else is wrong." The stages of this process are repeated for each of the four "persons," after which the Buddha proceeds to analyze these views grounded in partial experience and points out which portions are true (because verifiable by trial and experience) and which are dogmatic superstructure which is unjustified. Finally, the Buddha explains his Great Exposition of Kamma in which he shows that notions of invariability like "the evildoer goes to hell" are much too simple. The minds of people are complex and they make many different kinds of <i>kamma</i> even in one lifetime, some of which may influence the last moment when <i>kamma</i> is made before death, which in turn is the basis for the next life."</i><br />
					A sutta which breaks down the logic behind the non-carelessness not to quickly draw generalizations from personal experience.<br />
					Note in this sutta that there is no question that an intentional deed produces the result as per the intention. It always does. What this means, however, should be understood not as meaning that the form or shape of the intended deed is the result, but that in accordance with the sensation intended to be produced by the action so is the deed experienced. A deed of thought, word, or body intended to cause pain, results in the experience of pain. The shape of that pain may vary from the shape taken by the deed.<br />

					The Buddha provides a scale for the expected <i>kammic</i> return on gifts to individuals and gifts to the Order in its various forms.<br />
					Ms. Horner's translation is tarnished by frequent misleading references to commentary. The point of this sutta is to say that a gift to the Order, even if the members of the Order at the time are unworthy individuals, is more potent in terms of <i>kammic</i> consequences than a gift given even to a living Buddha. This is stated straight out and contradicted in a note from the commentary!<br />
					There is also a discussion in this sutta of 'purification' of gifts by either the giver or the recipient. What does it mean that 'an offering is purified'? The potency of an action is relative to the detachment of the giver and the receiver. It is as though a certain amount of the energy in the deed is held back or weakened by the attachment of either the giver or receiver thus diminishing the <i>kammic</i> consequence or creative force it would have if left free. But the encumbered deed can aparently be restored to its full potential (? or at least can have its potential boosted; purification does not necessarily mean that a thing has become wholly pure; the sutta is, after all, giving us in effect, gradations of detachment in individuals) by the degree of detachment of one or the other or both the giver and the receiver. The <i>'sila':</i> and <i>'kalya-dhamma',</i> the 'ethical conduct' and 'lovely-manners' are in this sutta the indicators of the detachment of the individual. So for example, a gift given by one of poor moral habit (just to choose something likely to be familiar to the reader) is purified to a certain degree by a recipient of good moral habit, to a greater degree by one striving after Stream-entry, and to still higher degrees by those further along the path. This is, in any case, how I understand this matter.<br />

					The Buddha cuts off an argumentative questioner by telling him that in his teaching there is no arguing with anyone about anything and by this he is free. In repeating the insident to the <i>bhikkhus</i> he is questioned as to what this teaching is that argues with no one about anything. The Buddha explains in brief that it is by having no interest in the obsessions and perceptions that assail the mind. Then further the <i>bhikkhus</i> ask for a clarification of this of Mahā Kaccana, who speaks of the obsessions and perceptions that arise from sense experience.<br />
					Mrs. Horner, following the <i>Pāḷi,</i> abridges two repetitions of the main body of this sutta. The abridgments in the <i>Pāḷi</i> are not indicated as abridgments (by the usual "...pe...") but are done with summary statements. The usual case would have been that the monks and then the Buddha would have repeated all that which had been said and done in each case (each repetition making precise recollection more likely and testifying to the veracity of the testimony). This method of abridgment alone speaks to the fact that the Majjhima was compiled later than either the Aṅguttara <i>Nikāya</i> or the <i>Saṃyutta</i> Nikāya. It represents a lessening (however slight) of the respect for precision in recounting the events and sayings of the Buddha, a degradation likely resulting from the arising of the written text. As with cell-phone texting today [Monday, November 16, 2015 6:40 AM] and e-mail yesterday and television before that and radio before that and writing before that, each new generation of communication and memory enhansing devices destroys rather than inhances communication while degrading our ability to remember.</p>

					The Buddha provides a complex simile illustrating by way of a herd of deer and a crop of corn set up to trap it the relationship of the <i>arahant</i> to the realm of the senses.<br />
					This is a mind-bending sutta, intended I believe, by way of its convoluted repetitions, to exercise and create in the mind of the listener a depth and objectivity of perception (so and so many removes from 'one-to-one') that closely resembles the perception of the arahant. A really valuable sutta in the way it describes the relationship of the <i>arahant</i> to this world, that is, that the Arahant still feeds off this world, but because of his habitat is invisible to Māra, Death, the Evil One. The questions to ask are: What is the nature of this feeding off of this world? And what is that habitat?<br />

					There is a problem with the last section of the <i>Pāḷi.</i> The problem is either with the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> or the BJT/CSCD (BBS and SBJ eds.,) or all of the above. In the PTS the the first half of the last section, before the simile, has the <i>bhikkhu</i> attaining release from things connected to time which is then cast as a position from which he is likely to fall away. The second half of the PTS version of the last section has the <i>bhikkhu</i> attaining release from things not connected to time which is then cast as a position from which there is no falling away.

					Saccaka, who has been boasting and bragging that he can defeat the Buddha in debate when he meets him in debate is upset after his first utterance. The Buddha then teaches him <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					This is a wonderful example of old time debate. It also shows how politely and reasonably such a debate was conducted even when the consequences were as hair-raising as they are shown to be in this sutta. There is no attempt to bring the debate to a pre-mature conclusion simply because Saccaka feels bad. What our board monitors need to see is that by terminating debate for the sake of maintaining good feelings is preventing the discovery of deeper truths. We hang on to our beliefs; getting them destroyed is painful; going through that pain is the only way of reaching higher wisdom.<br />
					This debate also shows how a really wise debator takes defeat and turns it into an advantage.<br />
					This sutta concludes with an exchange which should put to rest all doubt about the impossibility of transference of <i>kamma.</i> Saccaka, in gratitude for his instruction, invites the Buddha and the <i>Saṅgha</i> for a meal. To prepare the meal he asks his friends to donate to him what they feel they owe him. He then gives what he has received to the Buddha and the <i>Saṅgha.</i> Then he asks that the merit for such a meal be received by the doners. The Buddha explains that the doners have given to Saccaka and will receive <i>kammic</i> consequences that accord with the rebound from one such as him whereas Saccaka, who gave to the Buddha will receive the <i>kammic</i> consequences of one who has given to a Buddha. No transference of <i>kamma.</i><br />

					The Buddha teaches Saccaka about training the body and training the heart.<br />
					Note that this sutta is given before Gotama's breakfast! There is some very interesting information here about what constitutes the development of body and the development of the heart. This sutta also relates some of Gotama's very early practices and the recollection which finally lead him to the path to awakening.<br />
					Ms. Horner, Bhk. Bodhi, Bhk. Thanissaro, and Sister Upalavana all translate <i>'citta-bhāvanā'</i> as 'development of mind.'<br />
					Ms. Horner notes commentary here as saying that development of body <i>kāya-bhāvanā,</i> is <i>vipassanā,</i> insight, and development of mind, <i>citta-bhāvanā</i> is <i>samatha,</i> calm.<br />
					This would make <i>vipassana</i> practice = <i>Satipatthana</i> practice (the setting up of mind or memory) the development of body, and the development of calm through <i>jhāna</i> practice, the development of mind. This seems a little backward to me.<br />
					If, in stead of translating <i>citta-bhāvanā</i> as 'development of mind' we translate it as 'development of heart', the use of <i>jhāna</i> practice to calm the heart is more easily understood. But how does <i>Satipatthana</i> practice amount to development of body?<br />
					I suggest that the message of the sutta is that the development of the body and heart occur symultaneously in the practice of letting go lust for sense-pleasures and lust for things that make for sense-pleasures.<br />

					Each translator has his own notion of what the title of this sutta may mean. PED has the term <i>'nimantana'</i> as 'invitation'. <i>ni</i> = in; <i>mant</i> = mind, command; intend. Ms. Horner: 'Challenge'; Bhks. Thanissaro and Bhodi: 'invitation'; Sister Upalavanna: 'Address'. How about: 'All of the above.' A pun, meaning to address, and invite, and challenge. Address as in sword-fighting; invite as in kung-fu movies where one fighter indicates with his hand 'bring it on'; a challenge to combat or to discovery.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>This brings to conclusion the scanning, proofreading, formatting and uploading of <i>Majjhima Nikāya,</i> Volume 1: <i>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha,</i> Vol. I: The First Fifty Discourses.</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Please note: I have, for the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i> proofread and formatted only the PTS translation and those <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translations of those suttas which are being currently uploaded; I have not made any effort to link sutta references in footnotes; and I have not proofread or formatted any previously uploaded <i>Pāḷi</i> or translations.<br />
					The result is that because of the greater early interest in the <i>Majjhima Nikāya,</i> a considerable number of PTS translations and the majority of the <i>Pāḷi</i> Suttas on the site are currently not unabridged or formatted for easy comprehension. This policy is being adopted with the idea that should the project be terminated prior to arriving at the most optimum state (all suttas and translations proofread, fully formatted, and with footnote references linked to their suttas) there will be (cross fingers even for that!) at least the digital text of these otherwise unavailable PTS translations available for others to work with.</p>

					The Buddha explains to Jivaka what is and what is not allowable in the way of meat for the <i>bhikkhus.</i><br />
					A sutta to consult when the endless debate over vegetarianism comes up. Let me have another shot at clarifying the situation. There is <i>kamma,</i>  and there are the rules for the <i>bhikkhus,</i> and there is doing good deeds. As far as <i>kamma</i> goes, the operant factor, the efficient cause of a <i>kammic</i> consequence, is intent. Where there is no intent to cause harm, there are no <i>kammic</i> consequences. The rules for the <i>bhikkhus</i> are based on the law of <i>kamma.</i> There being no intent to harm in connection with eating meat that was not killed by one's self, killed upon request by one's self, or suspected to have been killed specifically for one, there is no <i>kammic</i> consequence and there is no rule against eating meat of such a sort. Where some individual decides that he wishes to reduce the demand for meat that is the motive for the butchering of animals, that is an intentional good deed and is to be praised. When an individual blames a person who does not have any intent to harm living creatures, but who eats meat as per the factors that make it kammically blameless, then that person is blind to the nature of <i>kamma</i> and is making bad <i>kamma</i> by holding a wrong mental position. And the louder and more forcefully they do that, the worse is the bad <i>kamma</i> they make. Finally, the <i>bhikkhus</i> are beggars. Beggars should not be choosers. They are in the right refusing meat that is not allowable because in the refusal is a lesson given to the doner of what is allowable. But in the ordinary course of the begging round for a beggar to refuse meat lawfully given is to deprive the doner of good <i>kamma</i> and that is bad <i>kamma.</i> There are countries which are primarily vegetarian and situations where the <i>bhikkhu</i> may have a choice. In the case where the doner of a food gift gives the <i>bhikkhu</i> a choice, there is no problem with his requesting to be given vegetarian food only. The layman, of course, can choose to be a vegetarian or not according as he wishes with no adverse consequences.<br />

					A detailed discussion of the five fetters to lower rebirths and the practice by way of which these five fetters are eliminated so as to result in non-returning.<br />
					A vital passage of this sutta is mangled by both Ms. Horner and Bhk. Bodhi and I put together an analysis which attempts to make sense of it in the archives of the old BuddhaDust Forum: <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/fetters.htm">The Five Fetters to the Lower Rebirths.</a><br />
					Note also in this sutta that the Buddha is describing attainment of Non-returning in multiple ways, the first of which is just the first <i>jhāna</i>.<br />
					Another thing to note is the importance placed on actually getting a grasp of the problem of rebirth: One must see body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness as not stable; so seeing one must see that as a danger and re-focus one's attention on the idea of escaping death and rebirth. So focused one must see that it is by ending own-making, stopping reaction to sense-stimuli and action based on desires and passions that this is accomplished. This is the major stumbling block I perceive out there in the world of Buddhist teachers and practitioners today [Saturday, November 28, 2015 7:01 AM], that is, that they do not perceive or teach the real issue, that Buddhism is being taught as though its first importance were as a way to find happiness in this world. Bring your mind to attention to the real problem: death and rebirth. Happiness in this world results from those practices which deal with this real problem as a matter of course. It should not be made the goal.<br />

					The Brahmin Brahmayu, at the age of 120, is converted and becomes a non-returner when he sees the 32 marks of a great man in Gotama and is taught a gradual course in <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					This is a very long sutta with many interesting points including a list of the 32 marks of a great man. It needs to be said when this subject comes up that these 32 marks are not to be taken literally. There is a subtle manifestation of the marks on the physical body, but they are primarily to be understood symbolically. Here also, I believe, too literal translation may obscure a more figurative meaning. Further it is helpful to think of the Buddha's body as being in a sphere that is somewhat less material than the ordinary body — More plastic and subject to being manifest according to mind so that some will see his body in the ordiary way while others, with more vision, will see it with such things as his aura, rays, and so forth. The fact of this brahman being 120 is not that unusual in the suttas. It seems that life expectancy has undergone a decline since those times rather than the increase the medical profession claims — the increase being measures from the depth of the barbarity of the European middle ages. There is a very intersting description of what was considered good form at the time, including a description of 'table manners.'<br />

					Keniya, a matted hair ascetic is greatly satisfied by a teaching of the Buddha and invites him and the order of <i>bhikkhus,</i> 1200 in number to a meal for the next day. In the meantime Sela the Brahman seeing the preparations for the meal being made by Keniya, is told that it is for an Awakened One. Sela is stirred by the idea of an Awakened One and visits the Buddha immediately and he, and his 300 followers are converted. The next day the Buddha and the order of <i>bhikkhus,</i> some 1500 in number show up for the meal.<br />
					This sutta is full of magic! There is no mention at all of Keniya being in the slightest way disturbed by the addition of 300 guests for the meal. Can you see why? Note the way that Gotama responds in kind to the address in verse. This sutta gives us a peek into the very different way things were done within the closed society of the Brahmins versus that of the ordinary people of the time.<br />

					The Buddha gives a detailed refutation of the doctrine of the Jains and sets forth his counter-argument in his method for the ending of <i>kamma.</i><br />
					An extremely important sutta which is a shameful mess in the Horner translation and it is not at all clear in the other translations. It needs an entirely new translation. I have done a paraphrase version in which one can at least follow the argument.<br />
					It is a world-wide phenomena in religions that the dues required for salvation is pain. The Buddha refutes this argument by explaining that it is by not reacting (that is 'not reacting'; that is not 'not experiencing'; one does not fight against or pursue the furtherance of on-coming experience) to pleasant or unpleasant experience with grasping or aversion that past <i>kamma</i> is resolved, freedom from <i>kamma</i> attained. The first effort at putting this method into practice is usually accompanied by pain of withdrawl. The yearning to prolong the experience of pleasure, when denied, is painful; the urge to escape pain, when denied, is also initially painful. The ending of the old habit of reaction is painful, but it must be seen as a secondary pain. The Buddha gives as an example the painful sensations that accompany the curing of an injury caused by a poisoned arrow. It is this experience which is being mistakenly interpreted as the fee for freedom. It is not the fundamental fee for freedom. Not everyone will have such dues to pay. The fee for freedom is the non-reaction.<br />

					In this sutta the Buddha outlines various views about the nature of the real, essential self and the world, past, future and present and points out that these views are all speculative and that for true satisfaction and liberation one must let go of all that which has been constructed, including speculative opinions.<br />
					As is suggested by Ms. Horner, this sutta should definitely be read along with the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Brahmajāla-Suttanta.</a> It has some interesting differences. (I do not say 'contradictions.') Ms. Horner, here, as throughout her translation of the Majjhima relys heavily on the commentary. In the case of this sutta at least the commentary has tended to force an interpretation of what is being said where it would be better taken as it is given.<br />

					The Buddha shows Sunakkhatta a path to <i>Nibbāna</i> together with several similes to help illustrate his points.<br />
					The path is a very unusual one! Unique in the suttas. He takes Sunakkhatta from a point where he is interested in irrelevant issues like the accomplishments of certain <i>bhikkhus,</i> through abandoning sense pleasures, to 'unshakability', to The Realm of No Things Had, to the Realm of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception, to temporary <i>Nibbāna,</i> to <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					Unshakability here may mean becoming a Stream-enterer, or it may mean someone who has attained the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> it is not defined. It may just mean someone looking for conviction in something. The next sutta illustrates how this concept should be understood as a quality, not a destination.<br />

Picture the house immitating, as a house might, the boasting and braging, joke telling and various impropper behaviors of the <i>bhikkhus.</i> It is that sort of thing which cause the hair to stand on end.

					Venerable Ānanda explains how the four paths to magic power use desire to bring about the end of desire.<br />
					A question that frequently comes up among beginners bound up in logic.<br />
					Interesting in this sutta is the difficulty of sustaining the translation 'investigation' for <i>'vīṃansā.'</i> In the <i>Pāḷi</i> Ānanda asks a series of questions all phrased identically:<br />
					Did you not previously have <i>(chanda, viriya, citta, vīṃansā),</i> so: "I will get me to the park."<br />
					The difficulty is getting a construction in English that is identical for all four. I see I have used 'investigation' in my translation here but I retain a pre-disposition to use the more literal 're-membering'. That is that in accomplishing any desire there is the reconstruction in mind by way of memory of the steps needed to attain that desire.<br />
					Also of interest is the discussion in Woodward's <a href="http://localhost/themozone/bd/dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.51.015.wood.pts.htm#fn2">footnote on chanda</a> where I would dispute that in this <i>Dhamma</i> there is any moral issue involved in the term or any distinction being made between a moral and an un-moral sort of desire. All desire is on a level in this system, including the desire for attaining Arahantship. The desire for attaining Arahantship is the desire for attaining that arahantship for some sort of self. Its like trying to lift yourself by your bootstraps. Can't be done.<br />

					Ānanda asks the Buddha if he is able to reach the <i>Brahmā</i> realm in the physical body as well as in the mental body and is told that he is able to do so and explains how.<br />
					A very important sutta for clearing away the illusion one may have that magic powers are exclusive to the astral body. (Where it is very easy to convince one's self that one's day-dreams are great attainments.) In a verse from the brethren <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.104.rhyc.pts.htm">[#104]</a> referenced in a footnote we also get a vivid description of <i>'sukha'</i> the pleasure experienced by the meditator in a high state of <i>samādhi:</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Buoyant in sooth my body, every pulse<br />
							Throbbing in wondrous bliss and ecstasy.<br />
							Even as cotton-down blown on the breeze,<br />
							So floats and hovers this my body light.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha's description of his method of attaining the plasticity and lightnes to rise up into the air is worth pondering:<br />
					<i>"Yasmim samaye kāyam pi citte samādahati cittam pi ca kāye samādhati|| ||<br />
					Sukhasaññañ ca lahusaññaāā ca kāye okkamitvā viharati|| ||</i><br />
					Woodward: "At such a time as <i>Tathāgata</i> concentrates body in mind and concentrates mind in body, at such a time as he enters on and abides in the consciousness of bliss and bouyancy..."<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: "When the <i>Tathāgata</i> immerses the body in the mind and the mind in the body, and when he dwells having entered upon a blissful perception and a boyant perception in regard to the body..."<br />
					Mine: "At such a time as the <i>Tathāgata</i> abides<br />
					with body aligned with heart,<br />
					and heart aligned with body,<br />
					and body is steeped in<br />
					perception of pleasure,<br />
					perception of lightness,<br />
					<i>'Samādahati',</i> <i>samā</i> = 'even', 'level' 'lay out'; <i>Ādahati</i> = 'lite', 'fire up'; (Woodward takes this to <i>samādhi</i> for his 'concentrates'; my 'align' tries to cover both possibilities (and it seems likely that this is where we get the term <i>samādhi</i>).) the critical word to understand.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi believes this reading to be incorrect and reads: <i>'Samodahati',</i> (PED: <i>[saṇ+odahati]</i> to put together, supply, apply) and explains: [which word is] "... strongly supported by the explanation: "(He) immerses the body in the mind: having taken the body, he mounts it on the mind; he makes it dependent on the mind; he sends it along the course of the mind. The mind is an exalted mind. Movement along the course of the mind is buoyant (quick). (He) immerses the mind in the body: having taken the mind, he mounts it on the body; he makes it dependent on the body; he sends it along the course of the body. The body is the coarse physical body. Movement along the course of the body is sluggish (slow)."<br />
					Ok, his translation may be strongly supported by the explanation, but what does the explanation explain? This is mumbo-jumbo as far as explanation goes. That is, what needs to be said could be said in much more clear terms and said in more clear terms it makes nonsense of the way it is said. Except for the added confusion 'immersion' leaves us precisely where we began: in a body immersed in and dependent on mind and a mind immersed in and dependent on a body. Maybe its the translation.<br />
					This idea in other terms would be: Diminish the differentiation between the material and the mental working at it from both sides; a mind that sees the material body in the same terms as an imaginary body; a material body with the same properties of plasticity as an imaginary body. This is essentially the task required of every act of magic.<br />
					Finally, PED on <i>'Samādahati',</i> = to put together' would be a synonym for <i>'Samodahati' anyway.</i><br />

					<p class="f4">"Then goodbye to you, Aubrey,' said the Admiral, holding out his hand.

					<i>Not a series I can recommend as it is essentially irrelevant to the purpose of attaining awakening, but those who are able to read from the perspective of the Buddhist ethical position will find in it an excellent, though unintentional, view, clearer than will be found in the most scholarly of academic histories, of the way flawed British values lead to the incredible arrogance, the misguided thinking, and corruption that brought about the fall of that great empire. Also found in this series are descriptions of everyday life which although two thousand years later and in a different country with different values, paints a picture of life

					I have translated: "observing the body, through the body" also "living in body, overseeing body",<br />
					I have reasoned that because this is a practice for setting up a recollected mind <i>in the state in which we find ourselves</i> (that is, primarily identified with body, or sense-experience, or emotions, or the <i>Dhamma</i>) with the intent of seeing body, sense-experience, the heart (or mental states) and the <i>Dhamma</i> as passing phenomena whether currently considered as 'our own' (internal) or 'of the outside' (external) such that we can observe these things whether internal or external or both external and internal as passing phenomena, painful, and not in any way 'our own' such that we may become totally detached therefrom. Hense the idea: 'while we are living in.' But today, it occurs to me that this carries weight or shadow of identity that is not in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and is not necessary for the passage to make sense even in English.<br />
					So today [Monday, October 12, 2015 3:38 AM] I think that we should be translating:<br />
					'[one] lives seeing body following upon <i>(anu)</i> body', or, in the case of this sutta:<br />
					'[one] lives seeing body following upon internal passing things.' In other words seeing phenomena in a way similar to the way one might view the flipping of a series of images making up an animated cartoon.<br />

					Given the fact that at another point Sariputta scolds Anuruddha about his pride of attaining clairvoyant vision of the thousand world system, and here in a similar statement Anuruddha make a similar claim where the higher claim would have been that he had attained the eradication of the <i>asavas,</i> one cannot help but think that this was a lesson being taught Anuruddha. But there is no indication that he understood at this point. In the next sutta, given at a different location, hence also at a different time, and by implication of its location in the sequence at a later time, he is reported to say that they lead to the eradication of <i>tanha</i> (thirst), which is the goal.<br />

The actual term means 'chariot builder' which could be interpreted as 'in charge of conveyances.'

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.55.023.wood.pts.htm">Godha or Mahanama (c),</a> the F.L. Woodward translation.<br />
					Mahanama and Godha debate whether the Streamwinner has three essential features or four. They bring the debate to the Buddha for resolution.<br />
					This is an interesting sutta for stretching intuitive vision. The debate between the two, though brought before the Buddha, is not resolved in so many words. Godha, who in the original debate speaks first, states that there are three essential features of stream-winning. Mahanama, who has heard face-to-face (in the previous sutta <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.55.022.wood.pts.htm">#22</a>) that the Streamwinner has four essential features speaks second. Godha suggests they consult the Buddha for the resolution of the issue. After repeating to the Buddha the previous dialogue, Mahanama continues his side of the argument with a strong statement of his faith in the Buddha. At this the Buddha turns to Godha and asks him what he thinks about Mahanama now. Godha's response is non-commital. There ends the sutta.<br />
					What has happened?<br />
					Mahanama is saying with this declaration of faith: "Not only am I a Streamwinner and know by that, but my faith in the Buddha is unshakable and I have heard, face-to-face with the Buddha the statement that the Streamwinner has these four attributes. I will hold this position against all commers based on this faith in the Buddha.<br />
					Godha is saying: No argument that there are four, but a person who understands the <i>Dhamma</i> at a higher level understands that possesing any one of the four is the equivalent of possessing all four. Let us go to the Buddha himself and he will make this clear.<br />
					By not saying that the one is correct and the other is incorrect the Buddha confirms Godha in his view while giving Mahanama a path (the one we are using here to explain this sutta, that is, a paradox) to see in this way at some future point, and Godha goes along with the idea.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi, in a footnote explains it this way: <i>"Though the argument has not been explicitly settled, the matter seems to be clinched through Mahanama's testimony to his faith. By expressing so intensely his confidence in the Buddha, Mahanama confirms his status as a noble disciple, and thus his viewpoint must be correct. Spk-pṭ says that while one endowed with any one of these four qualities is a stream-enterer, one should explain in terms of possessing all four.</i><br />
					I would suggest only that this tends to imply (by the statement that the argument is 'clinched' and that his view is correct) that Godha's statement is incorrect and this is not the case. Both are correct. Mahanama's position is just not as broad in scope as Godha's. As for Spk-pṭ, the Buddha himself teaches it both ways and other ways.<br />
					Woodward's footnote explaining Godha's statement is a quote from the commentary that implies that he is just avoiding having to say that Mahanama is ignorant. But there is no deprecation of Mahanama there. If there were, that would show a lack of understanding of what Gotama had done and the sutta would be undone.<br />
					I say avoid the commentaries for just such reasons as are shown in this case. Go to the sutta, read the translations, work out your own translation, and come to your own vision. Commentaries where they are written down and not given face-to-face from teacher to students, should be seen as essentially the working-out in mind <i>for the sake of the commentator</i> of the meaning of a sutta (and by doing so publicly, however well-intentioned, are probably a mistake if not mistaken). The suttas are meant to be studied and the meaning worked out in mind, to explain them prior to being asked is (except for the fact that they should not be blindly trusted) to deprive the reader of this work of mind. ... for this I apologize to my own readers for the implication that I believe them to be a bunch of flats without sufficient enthusiasm to do more than skim the texts. Not so!  Should these commentaries be encountered first, as in the case of readers here, they should be seen as advertisements for the suttas, an invitation to examine the original for one's self. What should not be the case is that they be relied upon exclusive of examining the original suttas. I cannot emphasize this enough.<br />

					A good sutta for those of us with, shall we say, some deficiencies in our practice. Still, the lowest possible criteria — being able to distinguish what is well said from what is not well said — is no easy matter and for effectiveness in attaining streamwinning (defined essentially as the certain and permanent escape from rebirth in hell, as a ghost or as an animal and eventual awakening) requires at least contact with the <i>Dhamma,</i> though it implies that having this ability and continually traveling on rejecting the badly said in favor of the well said one will eventually come upon <i>Dhamma.</i><br />

					This is the Buddhist method of 'working cures'. It is generally not recommended that the <i>bhikkhus</i> work cures in that beings have their <i>kamma</i> to work out, but here and there we see it being done. In this case it appears to have been only a temporary reprieve, presumably to give Anāthapiṇḍika time to develop somewhat beyond this point. Here he is securely fixed in the position of Streamwinner.

								<h4 class="ctr">The Ethical Standards Much Praised by the Aristocrats<br />
								<span class="f3"><b>or</b></span><br />
								The Fourth Dimension of Streamwinning</h4>

								<p>These are referred to as 'training rules' or 'the householder's seeker's path'. They should be taken on with the idea: "Let me train myself to abstain ..."</p>

								<p><b>(1)</b> <i>pāṇa-tipātā veramaṇī,</i> abstention from injury to breathing things. This is <i>intentional</i> injury. But it is 'injury', not just 'killing,' and 'breathing things' includes plant life.<br />
								<b>(2)</b> <i>adinn'ādānā veramaṇī</i> abstention from taking what is not given.<br />
								<b>(3)</b> <i>abrahmacariyā veramaṇī</i> abstention from carrying on in an ungodly (non-Brahma; not-the best) way. Forgetting ethical standards in the pursuit of pleasure. Often translated abstention from adultery or chastity, but this is too narrow. As with #5 below the idea is the abstention from injurious behavior caused by pursuit of pleasure, not the specific pleasure. Where sexual transgressions are  specifically described the idea for laymen — the rules for <i>bhikkhus,</i> and the practices leading to the higher attainments such as non-returning are much more restrictive — is abstention from sexual intercourse in cases where the result would be dangerous to the self or harmful to another: <i>i.e.,</i> with another person's mate(s) or betrothed, with those still living with their parents, with those protected by the state or powerful individuals.<br />
								<b>(4)</b> <i>musā-vādā veramaṇī</i> abstention from negligent speech. The idea of <i>'musā-vādā'</i> is that which is said carelessly, not only lies but also thoughtlessly saying things that are not true, exageration, slander, passing along rumors, cussing, intentionally hurtful, provocative, insulting speech and name-calling, gossip, and speech which just wastes time;<br />
								<b>(5)</b> <i>surā-meraya-majja-pamāda-ṭ-ṭhānā veramaṇī</i> abstaining from careless behavior resulting from fermented or distilled drinks. This is alcohol. For us, with our plethora of intoxicants, drugs, psycho-active chemicals and insideous influences in our commodities, the general rule would be where the use of a thing causes careless behavior or neglegance. This 'rule' was a later addition to the first four and is really encompassed by them, and we can see in the case of <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_55_sotapattisamyutta.htm#p24">SN 5.55.4</a> and other similar cases, that the emphasis is on the consequence in neglegance, not the use of the substance.</p>

					The Buddha defines the <i>'puthujjana',</i> the disciple that lives carelessly and the disciple that lives carefully.<br />
					I have mentioned this previously but it is worth repeating: there is a habit among some <i>bhikkhus</i> weak themselves in knowledge of the <i>Dhamma,</i> eager for some indication of their superiority to the rest of the world, not adverse to insulting others to class anyone not a <i>bhikkhu</i> as a <i>'puthujjana,'</i> 'commoner'. Here in this sutta we can see that this term is to be applied only to those with absolutely no belief in the Buddha or his system. Those who do have belief but whose knowledge and practice falls short are called <i>'ariyasāvako pamāda-vihārī'</i> 'disciples who live carelessly'. Just having heard the idea that there is such a thing as awakening is a huge step in the right direction, any sort of faith in the Buddha and his teachings as being the way to attain that awakening should be respected as such.<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>For those individuals interested doing sutta readings (especially for live audiences) or in dramatizing suttas for video recording: There is a construction in the <i>Pāḷi</i> in which one person speaks followed by speech of another person where there is no indication as to the fact that it is two persons speaking. Sometimes even the 'ti' indicating the end of a person's speech is missing. In our English construction of dialogue we are used to having the speaker indicated in some way. Sometimes this is handled in translations by indicating the speaker in square brackets. However I have witnessed 'old time' story telling in which this sort of dialogue occurs and such transitions are indicated by a slight pause and facial and tonal differences. Even in the case of voice-only recording, the pause and tonal difference would be enough to convey the change.</p>

					The Buddha gives a detailed definition of each of the Four Truths.<br />
					A very important sutta! The details, the meaning to be understood by the brief headings 'This is Pain' etc. are not frequently found in the suttas. This is not the most detailed to be found but is a good start. For a more detailed set of definitions see the fourth section of the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">Satipaṭṭhana Suttanta</a> of the <i>Digha Nikāya.</i> Remember, however, that pushed to its widest extent the Four Truths encompasses the whole of the <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					Note that the definition of the first truth as being the the five stockpiles of fuel <i>(upādāna-k-khandha)</i> is the equivalant of saying 'everything that constitutes existence is pain'.<br />

					The Buddha gives a detailed definition of each of the Four Truths.<br />
					The difference between this sutta and the previous one is that here the definition of pain is the six personal or internal realms or spheres. Woodward: 'personal spheres of sense"; Bhk. Bodhi: Internal Sense Bases. That this was explicitly called 'the internal' spheres (or bases or realms) seems to call for a similar sutta using the external spheres, but that is missing. In any case the simple statement that pain is to be understood as the six internal spheres should not be read as excluding the six external spheres. The very point of the sutta is to show the equivalence of the senses to the <i>(upādāna-k-khandha)</i>; that is, everything in existence. (See on this the first several suttas of <a href="http://localhost/themozone/bd/backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm">The Salayatana Samyutta,</a> where both are called 'Pain.' The fact is that 'the world, the origin of the world, the end of the world, is to be found in this fathom-long body' (and other such statements) indicates that that which is experienced as existence is essentially all internal (when looking for it) external (when it is escaped from). Another possibility is that the '<i>āyatana</i> of the eye' etc. was understood to mean both the eye and visual object, etc. When the components (eye:visual object) are used separately in SN 35 they are not accompanied by the term <i>'āyatana.'</i><br />

					A variation on the previous wherein the Buddha states that it would be impossible to reject these four truths and come up with another set of four truths and claim that they were spoken by the Buddha. These sorts of claims made by the Buddha are not infrequent and must be understood at a higher level. It is not that he is saying that some fool cannot come along and say this. What is being said is that an earnest, honest seeker, examining these four truths would need to see the truth of them before he could in good faith reject them and seeing the truth of them would not reject them let alone come up with a better way of expressing the truths therein, let alone claim that the Buddha did not say them. These truths provide the solution to the problem of pain in existence in the most fundamental, general, rock bottom way such that there is no more fundamental, general, or rock bottom way to state them. ... which is why very careful attention should be paid by translators to the translation of the term <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dukkha.htm">'dukkha'.</a> 'Stress' and 'Anguish' for example, are not all-encompassing of terms of pain and suffering. The term needs to encompass all those features that define <i>'dukkha'</i> in the various places it is defined (for example, SN 5.55.13 and 14, above, and the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm">Satipaṭṭhana Sutta</a>.) There are really only two words in English of such scope: the literal 'shit' (do-do uk ukky k-kha), and 'pain'. And the clincher, for 'pain' is the fact that in the definition found throught the suttas of <i>dukkha</i> as: aging and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair, ('pain and misery' being the contrast between physical pain and mental pain,) the word which I have translated as 'pain,' that 'physical pain,' is <i>'dukkha'.</i> <i>Dukkha</i> needs to stand for physical pain and mental pain in the same way as does 'pain' in English.<br />
					There is another aspect to this. Middle-class American businesmen suffer 'stress'; upperclass English women suffer 'anguish'. Other strata of society will reject out of hand that they suffer either stress or anguish. Virtually nobody in their right mind will reject the fact that they suffer pain. The compassionate term therefore, considering mankind in general, is the term accepted most universally: pain. If the translator feels the need to take in higher orders of existence, such as the gods, he will consider the term 'shit' to be more universally understood. 'Pain' is really an abstract term; there is no concrete thing to point to to explain it that will imply both mental and physical pain. I yield for the most part in my translations to the sensibilities of the modern reader of English and use 'pain' for my translation of <i>'dukkha',</i> but the literal meaning should be kept in mind when you come across the <i>devas</i> or face rebirth. Of course the even simpler way to handle this is to leave the term untranslated and add it to the English vocabulary. "Dukkha happens."<br />

					<i>Avijjā</i> is translated as 'ignorance' by Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi and almost all the other translators, but, unless you hear in this term 'Ignore -ance' understanding it to mean not that one is ignorant of a thing but that one is ignoring (refusing to acknowledge) one's knowledge of it, 'ignorance' is not the idea here. The idea here is precisely ignoring: 'not seeing' having penetrating knowledge and vision of, ('vijja' = 'vision'); understanding, seeing it as it really is, and not heeding one's vision.<br />
					If this were not the case anyone having once heard the four truths could be said to be without ignorance.<br />
					Make the connection: This is the first factor in the  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> , the one ultimately dependent upon which is 'own-making' or constructing one's own personal world. So when that formula is encountered, it should be understood to be saying: "It is because of blindness to the four truths that one constructs one's own world."<br />
					The stream-enterer has knowledge and vision of the four truths and is therefore not ignorant, but for some time he may still go on constructing his own world. He does so out of blindness to, the ignoring of, the truth that whatsoever he constructs ends in pain.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.019.bodh.wp.htm">Implications,</a> the <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translation.<br />
					The Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> that each of the four truths is capable of unlimited ways of being exprssed.<br />
					That is my understanding of the meaning of the sutta.<br />
					The key term here is: <i>Sankāsanā.</i> Also spelled: <i>Saṅkāsanā</i> and <i>Saṅkāsanā</i> I have spelled it as it is found in PED which defines it: "explanation, illustration."<br />
					Both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi note commentary as stating that synonyms are (PED definitions in ()):<br />
					<i>pakāsanā</i> = (explaining, making known; information, evidence, explanation, publicity),<br />
					<i>vivaraṇā</i> = (uncovering, unveiling, making open, revelation),<br />
					<i>vibhājan'uttānī-karaṇa</i> = (division; detailing, classification 'stretch out, flat-make (to make plain)),<br />
					<i>paññatti</i> = (making known, manifestation, description, designation, name, idea, notion, concept).<br />
					In Childers', <i>'saṅkāso'</i> = resembling.<br />
					For each, Gotama states that:<br />
					<i>Tattha aparimāṇā vaṇṇā,||<br />
					aparimāṇā vyañjanā,||<br />
					aparimāṇā sankāsanā,||</i><br />
					Such is immeasurably colored or shaded (Woodward: 'shades'; Bhk.  Bodhi: 'nuances'<br />
					immeasurably characterized (Woodward: variations of meaning; Bhk. Bodhi: details),<br />
					immeasurably <i>Sankāsanā</i>-ed (Woodward: 'ways of illustrating'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'implications'.<br />
					I suggest the meaning is to be inferred from the previous suttas where, for example, <i>'dukkha'</i> is defined in one sutta as the <i>'khandhas'</i> and another as the 'internal six realms'. In other words he is explaining this business of the interchangeability of various aspects of <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					I further suggest that this is not to say that <i>'dukkha'</i> or any other important term may be translated any which way or any way other than that which is most precisely aligned with its literal meaning (I believe that is being warned against in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p16">SN 5.56.16</a>), but that when that term is found, the concept expressed by it may be explained as encompassing other terms or other ideas may be equated to it without altering its meaning. There is a fine line there which must be respected between defining a term as such and such and equating such and such to that term.<br />
					<i>'Dukkha'</i> means <i>'Dukkha'</i> not <i>'Vihesā'</i><br />
					<i>'Dukkha'</i> encompasses <i>'Vihesā'</i><br />
					'Vihesā' does not encompass 'Dukkha'<br />
					'Pain' means 'Pain', not 'Worry'.<br />
					'Pain' encompasses 'Worry'.<br />
					'Worry (or Stress or Anguish) does not encompass 'Pain'<br />
					one way of understanding <i>'Dukkha'</i> is to know that <i>'Idaṇ'</i> or the <i>'Saḷāyatanāna'</i> or <i>'khandha'</i> is <i>Dukkha,</i><br />
					one way of understanding 'Pain' is to know that 'This' (whatever) or 'the realm of the senses' or 'the components of existence' are 'Pain'.<br />
					What makes these equivalants 'legal' and narrow, non-literal, abstract translations not, is that what the Buddha is saying in these cases is that every term that is equivalant to 'every existing thing' is capable of being understood as 'pain' whereas not every thing that is painful is capable of being understood to encompass all understandings of the term pain.<br />
					Why is this important for the practitioner?<br />
					Because when you are told 'thou shalt not kill' and you follow the commandment to avoid the wrath of God, you will behave differently than when you are told 'train yourself to abstain from harm to living beings' and you follow that advice pointing to your own best self-interest.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.030.bodh.wp.htm">Gavampati,</a> the <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translation,<br />
					Gavampati states to a group of elder <i>bhikkhus</i> that he has heard face-to-face with the Buddha that he who sees any one of the Four Truths also sees all of them.<br />
					This is understood in the commentaries to mean 'in the same instant', but we shall show that the meaning is 'upon arriving at the point of seeing, as it really is, in its totality'.<br />
					This is a very interesting sutta from the point of view of doubtful matters. Bhk. Bodhi, in a note to the print edition, confirms my belief that this statement is not made elsewhere in the four <i>nikāyas,</i> by the Buddha or anyone else. (What is said elsewhere is that each of the four truths is the equivalent of each of the others.) It is quoted it the  <i>Vissudhimagga</i>  and in Points of Controversy. Curiously in Points of Controversy Gavampati's point is defended by the Thereavadans in spite of its being (at least on the face of it ... we will get to that) in contradiction to numerous places where awakening is stated to be a gradual process. That awakening is an instantaneous (that is, all or nothing) event is the position of at least some Zen Buddhist schools.<br />
					How can we reconcile this dilemma without dismissing the statement of Gavampati as being false?<br />
					The key term here that must be understood is <i>'passati',</i> 'seeing'. The terms used for the Stream-enterer are: <i>ñāṇa</i> and <i>dassana,</i> 'knowing and seeing'. The difference between <i>dassana</i> and <i>passati</i> is that the former is an intellectual understanding whereas the latter is a penetrating vision, discovery, realization, of the actual reality. So we can say there is, up to the point of <i>passati,</i> a gradual expansion of comprehension, <i>'dassana,'</i> which, at a certain point results in a penetrating, comprehensive, all-encompassing vision of all aspects of a single truth which can be expressed in each of four ways (an awakening which could be called 'instantaneous').<br />
					Said another way, you cannot see the full scope of the idea that everything is pain until you see that it is a result of thirst (one cannot see the full scope of the statement that existence itself is pain, for example, until one is able to see that it is thirst-motivated behavior which brings about existence — to that point one is continuously trying to awaken the existing being, that is to 'awaken myself,' which cannot be done because awakening is outside of existence) and that by ending thirst that pain will end and that the way to end thirst is to mold one's behavior such that it does not exhibit any form of self-interest, i.e., thirst, that is, follow the <i>Magga.</i> And it is the same whether you approach the problem from this or any of the other three Truths.<br />
					There is a gradual course which leads up to a sudden, comprehensive, liberating vision, and one does not fully 'see' until one has reached that point.<br />

					<i>Vādin.</i> 'Professor'. In the old tradition of one who wanders around seeking truth by way of debating anyone who claimed to possess such. This is a lost art in most places in the world today [Saturday, November 07, 2015 8:08 AM] and that is a shame. This sort of debate used to exist even in this country. It was known as 'wrestling with the devil'. Among orthodox Jews such debate existed until very recently and may still exist. The debates often reached white heat and sometimes came to blows, but always ended with the understanding that the effort at bottom was to find the truth. The debate was separate from fellow-feeling. We are much at a disadvantage for the loss of this art. In our so-called 'forums' there is such fear of upsetting people's feelings (and thereby losing viewers and fame) that anything approaching true debate is cut off at the knees. What needs to be understood is that as long as debate is conducted according to <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/come_beggar/cb_001.htm">rules that will always lead to higher understanding,</a> upset feelings are the consequence of hanging on to wrong ideas. Nothing personal. Let them go and be happy.<br />

					The Buddha teaches the beggars that one should live recollected and comprehending.<br />
					Note in this sutta the distinction being made between <i>'sata'</i> and <i>'sampajāno.'</i><br />
					<i>'Sata'</i> (being recollected, having rememberance (pp of <i>sarati</i> = to remember (not precisely identical with <i>'sati'</i> as Woodward, Bhk. Thanissaro, Bhk. Bodhi would have it; the difference being that <i>sata</i> is more directly connected with the idea of memory or recall where <i>sati</i> is more directly connected with the putting to use of the recollected)) is defined as while living in body, sense-experience, the heart, and the <i>Dhamma,</i> over-seeing body, sense-experience, the heart, and <i>Dhamma</i> (or things) and is exactly the four settings up of memory which includes <i>'sampajāno'</i> (comprehension), and <i>'sati'</i> (to mind, minding) and involves the task of energetically eliminating greed and depression.<br />
					Comprehension <i>'Sampajāno'</i> is defined as the <i>'viditā'</i> (the seeing = knowing = finding out = dis-covery = wise as in 'I'm wise to that') of the rise ('Keep that tool cool fool, I'm wise to that rise in your Levi's'), manifestation, and resolution of sense-experience, word-thought and perception.<br />
					Sense-experience is the sensation (of pleasure, pain, or sensation that is neither painful nor pleasant) arising from the experience of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and awareness of things.<br />
					Word thought (<i>vitakka</i> = re-talking) is thoughts formed by words or the forming into words of a thought. Thoughts arise to one and are subsequently identified with and put into words.<br />
					perception (<i>saññā</i> = once-knowing) is the first point of conscious awareness where what is sensed (come into contact with the senses) has first had a name placed on it, that is, has been identified.<br />
					So putting it together we can say that being recollected means that one, while living in the body, sense-experience, heart (or mental states) or the <i>Dhamma</i> should over-see (that is observe and take care of) the body, sense-experience, the heart, and the <i>Dhamma,</i> with great energy <i>(ātāpi),</i> comprehending in connection with body, sense-experience, heart and the <i>Dhamma</i> the rise, manifestation, and resolution of sense-experience, word-thought and perception, such as to eliminate worldly greed and depression.<br />
					... and all this with regard to the self or external things or both the self and external things together.<br />
					... and further, all this only just to the degree that one is conscious that 'this is body', 'this is sense-experience,' 'this is the heart', 'this is <i>Dhamma.'</i></p>

					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> the setting up of memory, the bringing to life the setting up of memory and the way to the bringing to life of the setting up of memory.<br />
					Woodward's translation of <i>'-paṭṭhāna'</i> as 'stations' breaks down in this translation where the use is put into the singular. Woodward begins with 'the four' (not in the <i>Pāḷi</i>), but follows with 'a station' which is very awkward when it deals with the four together. I have changed it to the singlular throughout for internal consistency and consistency with the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Bhk. Bodhi translates 'establishment'. Since <i>'-paṭṭhāna'</i> can also be understood in the sense of 'pasture' (resort or establishment as in residence, or alternatively as basis of nourishment or just 'basis') which would face the same issues as 'station', if 'station' or 'pasture' or 'resort' or the like is for some reason preferred, the solution would be to set up the sutta so that the whole sequence was repeated four times, once for each of the 'stations' and the <i>Pāḷi</i> to then be considered an abridgment. There are precedents for such an arrangement.<br />

					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> the arising and ending of body, sense-experience, the heart and the <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					This sutta seems to have generated a great deal of confusion and debate continuing on down to our own time. Bhk. Thanissaro notes: This discourse is unusual in that it identifies the word <i>satipatthana,</i> not with the standard formula of the process of establishing mindfulness, but with the objects that form the frame of reference for that process. For example, instead of identifying the first satipatthana as, "There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world," it identifies it simply as "body."<br />

I have followed the pattern of the <i>Magga</i> <i>Saṃyutta</i> in my 'reconstructions'). In other words, these suttas are all just guesswork.

					This version introduces the 'one-seed man' and the clan-to-clan-goer and introduces the idea of the streamwinner that has just seven lives more to go. The one-seed man is described as of a lower degree than the once-returner but is described by the commentary as being its equivalent, that is that he has but one more life to go before becoming an Arahant. The distinction may be in the abode, where the one-seeder may be reborn in one of the <i>deva</i> worlds, where the once-returner is reborn once more in this world and becomes <i>arahant</i> here. The scale is apparently based on the time needed to achieve arahantship (the <i>deva</i> world being of vastly longer duration) (but this sounds very much like the non-returner to me; perhaps the distinction in this case is that the <i>deva</i> world is not in the Pure Abodes). The clan-to-clan goer takes rebirth in two or three families before becoming arahant. Considering all the various possibilities it appears that the only real constant is that once one has become streamwinner one is assured of attaining arahantship within seven rebirths. The variations can be anywhere between attaining arahantship in this life, or immediately subsequent to death, to traveling from realm to realm up to the highest Pure Abode, to taking an arbitrary number of rebiths up to seven more, either as human or <i>deva.</i> Pretty much any variation one could imagine. Someone looking for a project could put together a definitive description of the various possible alternative re-birth paths to Arahantship.<br />

					<p>"... a renunciation is not always total from the start, when we decide upon it in our original frame of mind and before it has reacted upon us, whether it be the renunciation of an invalid, a monk, an artist or a hero. But if he had wished to produce with certain people in his mind, in producing he had lived for himself, remote from society, to which he had become indifferent; the practice of solitude had given him a love for it, as happens with every big thing which we have begun by fearing, because we know it to be incompatible with smaller things which we prize and which it does not so much deprive us of as detach us from. Before we experience it, our whole preoccupation is to know to what extent we can reconcile it with certain pleasures which cease to be pleasures as soon as we have experienced it."<br />

Bodhi's: 'what is it that experiences' both of which break down at <i>Nibbāna</i> where there is no 'who' or 'experiencer') the scope and pasturage of such and such. The translators answer the two questions only in the first instance and then ask only about the home. (I have expanded the <i>Pāḷi</i> and my translation is fully spelled out.) This tends to point the thinking only in the one direction where both directions are important to understanding how this sutta is a lesson which could have brought someone to non-returning: that is, that it is a version of the <i>paticca samuppada.</i><br />
					Try this another way: The home of the senses is the mind, and the only point at which the full scope and pasturage of the senses is attained is from the perspective of the mind; the home of the mind is the memory and the only point at which the full scope and pasturage of the mind is attained is from the perspective of memory; the home of the memory is recollectedness (being in full possession of awareness of memory) and the only point at which the full scope and pasturage of the memory is attained is from the perspective of recollectedness; the home of recollectedness is freedom and the only point at which the full scope and pasturage of recollectedness is attained is from the perspective of freedom; the home of freedom is <i>Nibbāna</i> and the only point at which the full scope and pasturage of freedom is attained is from the perspective of <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					Woodward notes here that this is one of a very few suttas in which a layman is actually declared a non-returner. It is not exceptional that a layman becomes a non-returner but it is not often that an individual is so declared by the Buddha.<br />
					Also of note here is the distinction made between 'mind' <i>(mano)</i> and 'memory' <i>(sati)</i> and the description of the full functioning of <i>sati</i> as recollectedness <i>(satiyā)</i> and further the very interesting statement that freedom is what brings to life, re-animates, re-livens re-existences the range and pasturage of recollectedness.<br />
					Freedom from this body is necessary for rebirth in the next; and this also illustrates how it is that freedom in and of itself is not the same thing as arahantship; freedom must be seen as freedom and this is to be seen as the point, not a transition between lives. That recognition is what keeps off the tendency to rebirth experienced in freedom.<br />

					The simile is that of a river divided by an island where from one perspecive it can be seen as two bodies of water and from another as a single body of water. The island is individuality.

					This sutta seems confused to me. It may depend on a much more pronounced understanding of 'Ariyan wisdom and freedom' than currently exists, but I suspect it is a confusion of two suttas or sets of suttas. First Gotama states that by two forces one may attain arahantship, then defines those two forces as the Ariyan wisdom and freedom, then states that these are the equivalant of the forces of wisdom and serenity. This sutta is in a group that looks like it should be an orderly progression: 1 force: wisdom; 2 forces: wisdom + serenity; 3 forces: wisdom + serenity + memory; 4 fources: wisdom + serenity + memory + energy; five forces: wisdom + serenity + memory + energy + faith. In stead we get this strangely mixed sutta for #2 and #3 is omitted altogether. Still, it does give us another example of the way we must remember that terms in this system overlap each other.<br />

					Not tracing things back to their place of origin allows for wanting, deviance, lazy ways and inertia, fear and anxiety and doubt and vacillation to arise and when such arises it proliferates; but when one traces things back to their place of origin the seven dimensions of awakening arise and when such have arisen they roll on to complete development.<br />
					The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and the Woodward translation have this as two suttas. This is clearly wrong as separate, the first would have no reference to the dimensions of awakening which is the theme of this chapter. They are combined here as one sutta but for clarity in referencing I have retained the numbering.<br />
					I did my translation because to me the sutta reads 'tracing or not tracing things back to their point of origin, this arises, because it has arisen it is the source of further development.' Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi read this as 'tracing or not tracing things such and such arises and goes on to further development.' I think they have not traced things to their place of origin, but it can be read both ways.<br />

					The Buddha lists the diversions, then states how when one focuses one's mind on the <i>Dhamma</i> and is not diverted at such a time the seven dimensions of awakening can develop and come to completion.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi has divided this sutta into two and states that his perception is that they deal with two different subjects. I read this as dealing with one subject: first the statement of the diversions, then the statement as to how when they have been eliminated the seven dimensions of awakening can develop.<br />
					What I believe is going on here and in the previous sutta but one, is that we are seeing the work of late editors trying to organize what was likely originally one long lesson into the ten suttas usually making up a chapter.<br />

					The message of the striking image of the destructive powers of the small seed if allowed to grow is that even the person who has given up the world to become a homeless <i>bhikkhu,</i> if he still has even small traces of his former diversions and does not take measures to eliminate them is in great danger just because of the growth of mind made possible by the homeless life.</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/05_mv/sn05.46.041.bodh.wp.htm">Discriminations,</a> the <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translation.<br />
					The Buddha states that whatever shaman or brahman in the past, future or present has or will abandon the notions 'better am I', 'equal am I', 'worse am I,' all did or will do so by making a big thing of the seven dimensions of awakening.<br />
					This is not some liberal meat-head cockamamie commi pinko, egalatarian construction of an ideal mental state among beings: "we are all equals here!". It involves two perceptions: the first is the perception that there is no thing there that is the self not only of one's own, but of anyone; the second is that there being no self there of anyone in anything, there is no difference between any of its elements in terms of self-importance and to hold that there is is an indication that one is not yet seeing things as they are, and hence is a 'conceit' as Woodward puts it. <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi calls such a notion a 'discrimination,' thinking, presumably of the negative use of that word, but the situation here is not 'discriminating against or in favor of'. It is certainly reasonable within the context of seeking awakening for example, to discriminate between levels of accomplishment: that the Buddha's understanding is superior to, or that one's degree of awakening is inferior to or equal to those in the various stages. It is where notions of the self as <i>having</i> or <i>possessing</i> such or lacking such attainment accompanied by pride or shame or the idea of 'better' or 'worse' enter the picture that such notions become problematic. Otherwise the perception would be as detached as the cook's perception as to the donness of a loaf of bread in the oven: its not a matter of better or worse, superior or inferior, but of having reached a certain point of development. Even the idea 'better for mankind' 'better for the world' is a value judgment placed over an opinion as to the existence of the world which depends on notion of self-in-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the propitious miracle of self-esteem that, since few of us can have brilliant connections or profound attainments, those to whom they are denied still believe themselves to be the best endowed of men, because the optics of our social perspective make every grade of society seem the best to him who occupies it and who regards as less favoured then himself, ill-endowed, to be pitied, the greater men whom he names and calumniates without knowing them, judges and despises without understanding them.<br />

					<i>Dalidda.</i> 'poor hiker', wanderer, vagrant. This should incorporate both the idea of poverty and the idea of wandering around. Migrant-laboror. The contrast naturally arises between such a one and the <i>bhikkhu.</i> For one thing, there is nothing in the term <i>'dilidda'</i> that indicates that this sort of person does not do work for pay. Further than that, and deeper, though there have been some worldly-wise hobos, the further distinction is in the particular aim of the Buddhist <i>bhikkhu</i> to use this lifestyle as a tool in the search for awakening.<br />

					The Buddha explains the meaning of the expression: 'No pauper!' as being a person who has cultivated the seven dimensions of awakening.<br />
					This is the negative <i>(a-)</i> of the term used in the previous sutta and is really 'non-pauper', but we have the expression 'He is no pauper' which fits here very well. 'Pauper' would probably be the best term to use there if it were not lacking in the element of wandering around. My feeling is that generally the better translation in these cases is to use the same term in both the positive and negative as this will most clearly support the closeness of the translation to the original. On the other hand the student should make himself aware that when two different terms are used for the positive and the negative, there is likely some divergence from the original intent in one or the other or both of the terms used. I suggest that the divergence here (the element of wandering around) is symbolic: One without the seven dimensions of awakening wanders around poor in understanding, one who possesses the seven dimensions of awakening does not wander around mentally and is wealthy in spirit.<br />

					Just as the dawn is an early sign of the rising of the sun, so friendship with the good is an early sign of the appearance of the seven dimensions of awakening.<br />
					Birds of a feather flock together. Take a look around, are you friends with the good? Or do you have corrupt companions? If you can find no one you can be friendly with that appears to you to be intent on the good, then walk alone, 'like the bull elephant in the jungle keeping shy of the herd'. The whole issue of your being here in existence in the world is for the sake of companionship. If you cannot make that into an experience of the highest order, then the next most valuable thing you should do is cultivate the ability to tolerate loneliness. In any case the basis of companionship of the highest order is the mutual cultivation of detachment built on the appreciation of solitude. This is what should be understood as what is meant by 'the good'. That is, that it is ultimately not something to be sought for in persons, but in mental attitude. If one's companion is the appreciation of solitude, how can one ever be alone?<br />

					Woodward calls this 'the idea of the skeleton', Bhk. Bodhi: 'the perception of a skeleton'. I suggest the so-called 'after image' of the skeleton (a vision of the image of a great huge skeleton reclining in the cosmos) does not require having seen a real skeleton. (In the long distant past we have seen enough of skeletons!) Further, the message of the sutta is not that the goal is this image, but that in perceiving the skeleton when accompanied by the seven dimensions of awakening, the inference should be drawn that 'This body of mine, too, is just like that, is constructed just like that, has not got beyond the fate of that,' and that seeing that, any desire for body, ambition with regard to body is let go. Again I suggest that this is the meaning of: 'Living in a body, one regards body as body.' That is that we see body as it is, a thing subject to ending.<br />

					<p class="f4">PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translations would break up sub-chapters IX-XIII into two sets (repeating the sub-chapter headings, creating sub-chapters XIV-XVIII each according to the following (I use 'X. Non-carelessness' because I do not understand how 'IX. Ganga Repetition' could be divided up and make sense*:</p>

					<p class="f4">X. Non-carelessness</p>

					   <p class="f4 in1"><i>Tathāgata</i></p>

						      <p class="f4 in2">i. Seclusion</p>

					<p class="f4">XV. Non-carelessness</p>

					   <p class="f4 in1"><i>Tathāgata</i></p>

						      <p class="f4 in2">ii. Ending in Restraint of Passion</p>

					<p class="f4">... etc. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">which would create a different scheme for them than is found in SN 5.45 and not include the sub-sub heads 'Ending in the Deathless' and 'Ending in <i>Nibbāna'.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">* All versions are abridged so there is no clue. I speculate that the version as found in SN 5.45 was the first and that it was elaborated on to create the subsequent chapters. If this was the case then my X in this chapter could have been expanded to include the four sub-sub-sections. In any event the confusion here should certainly be considered a place to look for clues as to the original organization.</p>

					The Buddha describes the one sure way for beings to overcome grief and lamentation, pain and misery, to finding the method, and realizing <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					An exact parallel to the opening of <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">the <i>Satipatthana</i> Sutta</a>.<br />
					Both <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi and Woodward give references in their footnotes helpful for anyone interested in the meaning of <i>'ekāyana maggo'.</i> That is, is it 'the one and only way' or (Woodward): 'the sole way'; or (Bhk. Bodhi): 'the one-way path'; or (Soma Thera, Nyanasatta Thera): 'the only way'; or (Nyanaponika Thera): 'the sole way'; or (Bhk. Thanissaro): 'the direct path'; (Sister Upalavana): 'There is only one way' or my "one sure way"?<br />
					There is someing in the psyche of the times (and one which I have shared) that rebels agains the idea that the Buddha could be saying that his, and not just his but this particular one of his methods, is the only way to salvation. There is another way of looking at this. That is that whatever anyone else may wish to think about their (religion, discipline, philosophy) no other system provides a solution to the problem of rebirth. This beeing seen and attained by a person making such a statement, it is not a brag, but is simply a statement of a true fact. The issue then becomes only one of internal contradiction. How can this be the one and only when there are a half dozen others which have been declared to lead to Arahantship? The response to that, then, is that within the Buddha's system it can be shown that any of the other methods which are declared to be paths to arahantship can be shown to be the equivalent of the four settings up of mind.<br />

					The Buddha instructs the <i>bhikkhus</i> to be mindful and self-aware. Then he explains how to mind and be self-aware.<br />
					Here we have a very clear explanation of how the <i>satipatthana</i> technique is to be applied. The 'self-aware' aspect <i>(sampajāna)</i> (which takes up the bulk of the instructions in the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22"><i>Satipatthana</i> Sutta</a>) is the aspect of the practice concerned with observing and being aware; the 'minding' <i>(sati)</i> aspect is the governing of the mental attitude towards and reaction to what is observed.</p>

					<p>"... But often one hears nothing when one listens for the first time to a piece of music that is at all complicated. ... Probably what is wanting, the first time, is not comprehension but memory. For our memory, relatively to the complexity of the impresions which it has to face while we are listening, is infinitesimal, as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them, or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall a minute afterwards what one has just said to him. Of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture. But that picture gradually takes shape in the memory, and, with regard to works we have heard more than once, we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know, and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning. ...</p>

					<p>The reason why a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary, that few other men resemble him. It is his work itself that, by fertilising the rare minds capable of understanding it, will make them increase and multiply.</p>

					<p class="f1">— Marcel Proust, <i>Remembrance of Things Past,</i> Vol. 1, Swann's Way, p 570 <i>ff.;</i> C.K. Scott Moncrieff and T. Kilmartin, trans., Vantage Books, N.Y., 1982</p>

					<p>Proust goes on to make the point that it is no use for the genius innovator to hold back on the release of his work in the face of certain popular rejection because it is the work itself that prepares the ground for its reception. To release it at a later time would only be to release it for rejection at a later time. Like his vivid description of the way the mind works to build up a conscious memory, a new idea in the world must be repeated again and again before it takes root.</p>

					<p>Well in fact Gotama's work was recognized almost immediately and by a wide swath of the population of the country. But in this special case, that fact itself was part of the genius of his work. Shortly after Gotama's death the usual suspects came in and virtually completely eradicated what he had done. It survived, as much as it has survived, in the memorized and then written works and has been incubating for 2500 years among the more cultured of humanity. Some of its wisdom has seeped into the body of knowledge of the rest of the world. There is so much more. I have hope for greater acceptance by the present generation. It is an old story with mankind that in his youth man pursues ideals, in mid-life he turns to the acquisition of money and power and in his old age some return to the quest for knowledge of their youth. The so-called baby boom generation is just reaching retirement age. Life expectancy for a person retiring who has no obsession to keep his mind alive, is about three years. (He cleans up the garage, does a little gardening, reads a book, takes a cruse, spends a week formulating an exercise plan and dies.) Those with an abiding interest survive longer. Those whose youthful obsession was to become a man of knowledge may return to their youthful ambition and with wiser eyes and lucky contact discover Gotama's system. In the 60s the youth of the day were mislead by opportunistic gurus, in their better sense they abandoned their quest for realistic goals, today they have perspective sufficient to distinguish what is well said from what is said to pull the wool over their eyes.</p>

					<p>As for the mechanism for developing the memory: The task for the ordinary person who wishes to remember or memorize something is to repeat it and make connections, for the student of the Aristocrats who wishes to see things as they are the task is to develop such speed and unobscured attention to the perception of phenomena such that they become fully conscious as they form. There is, in the formation of a perception sufficient repetition and association to establish memory without personally initiated (<i>sankara</i>med) repetition or artificially invented associations.</p>

					Petty nit: The translations of Bhk. Bodhi and Woodward speak of the quail as taking refuge inside the clod of earth. But clods of earth are solid. What must be being spoken of is taking refuge behind or beside or between or among clods or even under an overturned clod. Bhk.

					In a fable describing the way a foolish monkey traps himself trying to rescue himself from entrapment by a tar baby, the Buddha instructs the <i>bhikkhus</i> of the dangers of roaming among the five cords of sense pleasure and the safety of sticking to the four settings-up of memory.<br />
					Another nit here. The trap is a post covered with tar. The Monkey to free his one hand does not grab the one hand with the other, but pushes on the post hoping that with that leverage he will free his stuck hand, but that sticks too. In this way the other appendages also get stuck. Woodward's 'grabs it' and 'grabs them' referring to the limbs, not the trap, breaks down when it is the head that gets stuck. And further grabing the one hand with the other would not necessarily result in the second hand getting stuck and might even give the monkey strength enough to free the hand. And how could even a monkey grab both hands with one foot? Etc.<br />
					The mistake that is illustrated by the fable is trying to free one's self from the pain consequent upon indulgence in (getting stuck in) sense pleasures by indulging in other sense pleasures. That is trying to free the stuck hand by pushing against the trap. So the whole sutta is spoiled by this error.<br />

					At a point shortly before his death the Buddha, after supressing a bout of his illness is asked by Ānanda about how the <i>Saṅgha</i> is to be governed after his death.<br />
					The Buddha's response amounts to saying that the <i>Saṅgha</i> is not lead by a leader as such, but by the <i>Dhamma.</i> That even the Buddha himself does not think of himself as leading the Saṅgha, but teaching the <i>Dhamma</i> which is, if there is any leader, the leader. It is in this episode that the Buddha declares that the <i>Dhamma</i> has been taught by him without the closed fist of the guru. That there is no secret inner teaching distinct from the outward teaching.<br />
					I hear this statement in conjunction with the question concering leadership. The Buddha is saying that the <i>Saṅgha</i> is not run like a cult with leadership passed down from master to master. (Of course today we find that this is exactly how most <i>Saṅghas</i> are run with the inevitable result that faith is placed in 'liniage' and the dubious teachings of 'patriarchs' rather than in understanding the <i>Dhamma</i> for one's self and with the further result of animosities between <i>Saṅghas</i> and the spread of confusion within and without the community.) The <i>Dhamma</i> is taught fully exposed and individuals understand it according to their own capacities and effort. Leadership such as it exists (ideally simple teacher/student relationships) is according to individual merit. As for esoteric vs. exoteric, or internal vs. external it is obvious that there is deep meaning to be discovered in the suttas. Similies to take one example, are in their very nature things of 'levels of meaning'. The difference is that the deeper meaning found in the suttas is not secret, hidden from those who do not possess private knowledge. Its out there to be discovered by anyone who digs for it. In fact it could be said that the main effort of the <i>Dhamma</i> is to bring as many people as possible to an understanding of its deeper meaning.<br />

					The Buddha explains the approach to the four settings-up of memory for the learner and for one who has attained the goal.<br />
					As Andrew Olendzki points out in his introduction to his translation of this sutta, it is not well known, but it is one of a very few suttas that go the one level beyond the presentation of method into the technique for using it in meditation practice. It ranks up there in the top ten of the most helpful suttas for meditators. It is very reminiscent of the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p122"><i>Mahā Suññata Suttaṃ.</i></a><br />
					I have done a translation applying my best understanding. This is a sutta where it is highly recommended that one compare translations and if possible dig into the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Each translation is slightly different in approach and the differences will have dramatic influences on practice.<br />
					My take is that the Buddha perceived that Ānanda did not fully understand how the four settings-up of memory were to be used to develop intent to attain happiness and then, happiness attained how they were to be used after letting go of all intentions with regard to the future and the past, as simply a pleasant means to observe the present. This sutta should also interest those who have followed Castaneda's Don Juan in that the explanation here of intent is very clear and it will advance their studies beyond his teachings which stop at the development of intent.<br />

					The Buddha questions Sariputta about his statement that there never was, never would be or was not now any greater teacher of liberation of heart than the Buddha.<br />
					Sariputta's response is instructive and anyone interested in becoming a streamwinner should study it until it is understood.

See also in this regard the discussion <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/certainty_without_faith.htm">'Certainty without Faith'</a>.

					The Buddha consoles Ānanda upon the death of Sariputta with a discourse on the ephemeral nature of that which has come to be.<br />
					Another example of the very unique way in which the Buddhist deals with grief over the loss of a loved one. There is an assumption in this position of the ultimate rationality of man which is inspiring. Essentially grief is considered to be a fault in the individual experiencing the grief. It depends on ignorance of the inevitability of change in existing things and represents not a concern for the fate of the dead person but a selfish concern with one's own loss, a loss which is itself an illusion based on the assumption of self.<br />

					Illustrating his point with a story about the way acrobats should attend to their safety, the Buddha explains how it is that by attending to one's own safety, one attends to the safety of others.<br />
					With regard to the title and the picture we should have of the acrobats I believe Bhk. Thanissaro has the clearest presentation: this is the first of two suttas delivered at Desaka which conclude this chapter and this one deals with acrobats. The trick they perform is that of balancing on a bamboo pole. The Master balances on the pole, the student balances on the master after climbing up the pole and climing up on the shoulders of the master.<br />
					As to the meaning it is a response to the argument heard when outsiders speak of 'the selfishness of the Arahant' or the 'Theravada' or 'Hineyana School of Buddhism'. This comes up most frequently when speaking to students of the Mahayana schools of Buddhism or to those who have heard this selfishness argument from Mahayanists. It is by protecting one's self that one protects others; protecting others is accomplished by protecting one's self. Imagine the consequence if the Master, balancing on the bamboo pole, in stead of paying attention to his balance, pays attention to the balance of the student on his shoulders. Or similarly imagine the consequence if the student in stead of paying attention to his own balance, pays attention to the balance of the master. It is in everyone's interest that one first attend to one's own 'balance'; it is by attending to one's own best interests that one attends to the best interests of others.</p>

					Ānanda and Bhadda discuss the purpose of ethical culture.<br />
					Woodward has contradicted himself in his translation of this sutta so that the question 'What is the purpose of <i>sīla</i>' is not answered, and in stead the purpose of the four settings-up of memory is made to be the creation of <i>sīla.</i> Bhk. Bodhi has got this much correctly. However <i>Sīla</i> is not [Bhk. Bodhi]: 'virtue'; or [Woodward]: 'habit' or even 'morality'. It is a <i>manta</i> (Skt. <i>mantra</i>) = 'to sow, etc.' = 'as ye sow, so shall ye reap' which is 'ethics.' That is, the counseling of behavior in accordance with a theory of how things work as opposed to 'morality' (counceling of behavior in accordance with normally accepted views on right and wrong) or 'virtue' (conformity to the 'right' in a theory of right and wrong). The behavior that is taught as best by the Buddha is that which conforms to one's own best interests in accordance with his theory of <i>kamma</i> as reflected in the Four Truths. Ethics. As it happens the resulting guidlines closely parallel generally accepted ideas of morality and the behavior of those considered virtuous so it is easy to think that the difference is unimportant. It is important. Though the behaviors of those non-Buddhists who today are termed 'moral' and 'virtuous' are similar in many ways to those Buddhists who are called 'of ethical behavior', they are not similar in all ways and at just that point where the differences are important for accomplishing the goal, they deviate. To mistake generally accepted ideas of morality and virtue as identical with Buddhist ethical behavior is to risk making a wrong decision a such critical junctions as death, under the influence of drugs or when in <i>jhāna</i> one has come upon great personal power.<br />
					Before one is able to live in a body overseeing body (etc.) such as to be able to eliminate coveting and depression one must be able to see things clearly. In order to see things clearly one's vision must not be blinded by the bias which the mind automatically generates in order to rationalize unetical behavior. Hence the pre-requisite is the cultivation of ethical conduct. This is the order in which these things are developed in <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/title_page.htm">'The Gradual Course,'</a> <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualsila.htm"><i>Sīla</i></a> and throughout the suttas.<br />

					The question is: What is the meaning of this and the previous sutta?<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi footnotes with explanations as to what it is that is experienced as a result of each of the conditions, but this cannot be the message of the suttas. How come? Because if the message were the results of each of the conditions the suttas would be as pointless as they appear — they would conclude without having provided a path to <i>Nibbāna</i> to make it a lesson. It does not go, according to this scheme, past the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. And still further there is no follow-up sutta which says: "And what, <i>bhikkhus,</i> is that experience?" which one would expect in the case of this having been a teaching in brief. I say again what I often repeat: We must seek the meaning of a sutta in the sutta as given. I suggest therefore the message is that with all these conditions, positive or negative, up to the point of having tranquilized desire, or thought, or perception itself, whatever the result, the result is sense-experience. Just sense-experience. Not the goal. In other words the message is precisely contrary to that implied by the commentaries, that is that the goal is not well served by concentration on attainment of the various intermediate steps. They happen, they are not the point.<br />

					<p class="f4">At about the same time as the arising of the Buddha the people known as Moche in the Paruvian Andes built a temple dedicated to the Moon in which there was a chamber which had a fresco that has come to be called 'the revolt of the objects'. This fresco depicts man-created objects such as shields and weapons which have taken on arms and legs and have turned against their creator, man. The immages illustrate the belief that there comes a time in this world, after a long long time, but sooner or later when the creations of man turn against him and destroy him allowing for a return to the peace of the original chaos of nature. Today we can see how farm machinery attacked and displaced farm workers by the millions while replacing healthy natural food products with those invented by man — unhealthy, disease causing, without spirit or taste. Automation has eliminated millions, and will in the near future eliminate virtually all low-paying jobs while reaching steadily into higher paying ones leading to nearly total unemployment, poverty, starvation and civil discontent. "I the Phone" has attached itself parasitically to the human in such a way as to lead inevitably to its host's utter destruction. For an amount shamefully beyond a reasonable profit the user pays for a device which he then feeds by an additional fee once a month with the result that his memory is sucked away into the wi-fisfere and he becomes dependent on this machine for the recollection of his own phone number, the way to the grocery store and the recollection of the features of his wife and children. In the same way as trusting the psychiatrist with one's problems without any evidence that such trust is warranted leads only to a mind that elaborates on its problems and makes them worse, so the ever making of a "more rewarding telephone experience" continually re-inforces and amplifies the deviant paths your explorations of the internet have revealed. Curiosity yields to the lure of absolute corruption. What to do to keep from being sucked down this drain-pipe dream? You need a purchase that does not involve purchasing. A stand that will keep you from being knocked over and spilling out your ... um ... vitality ... to the always listening Big Data Big Brother machine in your hand that is, for its own preservation and propagation, ever seeking to satisfy your every inclination no matter how depraved and dangerous. The Buddha has pointed the way. Use the Aristocratic Eightfold Path to judge yourself. Set up an internal but objective debate regarding your behavior and beliefs. Allow yourself to do only what you understand does not transgress this code. Make that your stand.</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.034.bodh.wp.htm">Going Beyond,</a> the <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translation,<br />
					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> the way to going beyond.<br />
					The question here is: Is this <i>"a-pāra apāraṅgamanāya saṇvattanti,"</i> (Woodward's: "conduces to that state in which no further shore and no hither shore exist") or <i>"apārā pāraṅgamanāya saṇvattanti"</i> Bhk. Bodhi's "lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore")? Woodward notes that: At <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p118"><i>A.</i> v, 233</a> the Buddha says the two shores are breaking and keeping the precepts. At <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p117"><i>A.</i> v, 232</a> (as here) it is the right and wrong eightfold way. The issue is the nature of <i>Nibbāna.</i> In these translator's terms: Is it a far shore or is it without shores.<br />
					The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> text is: <i>"apārāpāraṅgamanāya;</i> the CSCD has: <i>"apārā pāraṃ gamanāya,"</i> the BJT is: <i>apārā pāraṅgamanāya.</i><br />
					I suggest: <i>apārāpāra</i> be expanded to: <i>apāra ā-pāraṇ</i> "leads from the not-beyond to beyond" ('shore' enters the translation only through the simile and the minds of the translators). This takes one off the near shore without placing one on a further shore. On the not-beyond they go back and forth in misery, beyond they do not. This comports with the simile of the raft. The <i>Magga</i> and the precepts are the steps to the beyond, they are not the beyond. Following the precepts and the <i>Magga</i> does not lead to a place where both shores do not exist. This would be holding the theory of annihilationism. Arahantship is known by knowing that there is no more 'it'n and 'at'n' <i>(itthattaṇ).</i> The further shore is surely an 'at'n; the beyond the not-beyond is not.<br />

					I do not see how <i>'samaṇa'</i> can be argued to be anything other than 'shaman'. That it is defined differently by the Buddha than it is commonly understood to be is nothing unusual. I further suggest that the term <i>'sāmañña-brāhmaṇa'</i> originally indicated the distinction 'practitioners and scholars' with no prejudice intended. Even farther out on that limb, I suggest that <i>'sāmaṇa'</i> came down from <i>'sammā'</i> so that in the combination <i>'sāmañña-brāhmaṇa'</i> what we really have is 'highest-er/best-er'.<br />

					There is a difference of opinion as to the arrangement of the suttas in this and the following <i>vagga</i> (or maybe it is just me). The PTS, CSCD and Woodward appears to arrange the suttas: Subject: Division (Comprehension, Realization, Wearing out, Abandoning): 3 versions of the 8-fold path without repeating the beginning of the sutta each time (seclusion, dispassion, deathlessness, <i>Nibbāna</i>). The BJT and Bhk. Bodhi (though abridged), have the organization as: Subject: Division I: 1 version of the 8-fold path, Division I, 2nd version of the 8-fold path, etc. then Division II, etc. I have followed the PTS organization as described above.<br />

					In addition to the questions raised regarding the orginization of the previous chapter, the final sutta of this chapter, in the Burmese MSS B<sup>1-2</sup> (and only it) includes at its end what is, in the case of Bhk. Bodhi's interpretation, the equivalant of <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_45_maggasamyutta.htm#p91">§91;</a> in the case of Woodward's interpretation a repetion of the entire sutta.<br />
					Taking a wild guess I suggest that there was in some original manuscript some abridged indication that there was to follow here some sort of final conclusion. A terminal knot. I suspect this is also the case with the end of the previous chapter and explains the inclusion of the second Sutta #170. What then I would conclude would be the final conclusion in both Chapters is what Bhk. Bodhi suggests for this chapter alone: a repetition of §91. This would then bring the number of 'takes' on the Eightfold path to five, and would show that the five takes were a progression which flowed, slided and tended towards <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

I keep trying to encourage people to read these without skipping. Perhaps this is misguided. What would serve just as well would be to read them carefully enough to remember the sequence and then, in meditation, to reconstruct the whole. The vision of this work of art could then be seen in mind and it could never be forgotten.</p>

					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> about the diversions and the things that help in the development of the dimensions of awakening.<br />
					I have always found this sutta to be particularly obscure in that in several places it seems to be self-referential and uninformative. "What is the food of the memory-self-awakening dimension? Things based on the memory-self-awakening-dimension." I did my translation to see if there was something in the <i>Pāḷi</i> that was being overlooked, but the picture is not much clearer. It isn't that this doesn't make sense, or cannot be figured out, it is just that it does not much advance the story which is unusual. (Hint: I suspect it of having been partly forgotten and made up after.) Other than in the places where this occurs this is a valuable sutta for its detail concerning how to manage the diversions <i>(nivarana)</i> and how to develop the seven dimensions of self-awakening <i>(sambojjhanga).</i><br />
					Note: We can see in this sutta by the elaboration of <i>'dhamma-vicaya'</i> that this is research into 'things', not research into 'The <i>Dhamma.</i>' Woodward's 'Norm'. I have also translated this 'The <i>Dhamma</i>' and also <i>'dhamma'</i> and at this time I think I will not try to change what I have previously done as this points in any case to the ultimate goal of such research.<br />

					The Buddha describes how even just the sight of an Arahant can lead to Awakening or non-returning.<br />
					The translations of both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi are easy to misunderstand. They give the impression that the whole sequence from first seeing an Arahant to attaining the result is virtually instantaneous. "When a monk, so dwelling aloof, remembers and turns over in his mind the teaching of the Norm, it is then that the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness is established in that monk. When he cultivates the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness then it is that the monk's culture of it comes to perfection." etc. Bhk. Bodhi: "Dwelling thus withdrawn, one recollects that <i>Dhamma</i> and thinks it over. Whenever, <i>bhikkhus,</i> a <i>bhikkhu</i> dwelling thus withdrawn recollects that <i>Dhamma</i> and thinks it over, on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness is aroused by the bhikkhu; on that occasion the <i>bhikkhu</i> develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness; on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness comes to fulfilment by development in the <i>bhikkhu.</i>" The idea is that when he starts one thing he has at that same time also <i>started</i> the next thing, to fully develop the first thing the second thing must be fully developed; when the first thing has been fully developed the other things are at that time also fully developed. Development is a circular thing; a revolving evolving enveloping developing.<br />

					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> that neglecting the seven dimensions of awakening is neglecting the path to Awakening; undertaking the seven dimensions of awakening is undertaking the path to awakening.<br />
					The interesting thing about this little sutta is the fact that it refers to the seven dimensions of awakening as the <i>'ariyo maggo sammā dukkha-k-khaya-gāmi;'</i> the Aristocratic consummate way to the end of pain'. Woodward here understands this to be a reference to the Eightfold Way and inserts 'Eightfold' which is not there. Bhk. Bodhi translates properly as 'the noble path leading to the complete destruction of suffering,' but makes no comment. Could the <i>'bojjhaṅgā'</i> have been the original <i>"Magga"?</i> Not according to the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">'First Sutta'.</a> What is the explanation?

					The Dude would understand. Singular, Unique, Utter world-weariness: <i>ekanta-Nibbida:</i> one-ended-dis-abidability &gt; <i>vindati</i> = to find or to know (as in 'I found that to be ~" &gt; 'It was my pleasure to know" &gt; possess, enjoy, so dis-enjoy &gt; singularly unenjoyable). Woodward: 'downright revulsion'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'utter revulsion'. The problem with 'revulsion' is the implication that it is an emotion within. What is being spoken of is a perception that a thing out there is revolting. Like water rolling off a duck's back, the duck is not 'wetted' by the water. Dis-taste. Having no inclination to indulge. Having the idea, perception or knowledge, but not the sensation, that a thing is revolting.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/05_mv/sn05.46.026.bodh.wp.htm">The Destruction of Craving,</a> the <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translation.<br />
					The Buddha teaches the Venerable Udayi that which destroys thirst and the way to practice to destroy thirst.<br />
					Woodward has complicated this sutta by inserting the qualification, per his understanding of the remarks made by the Commentator, of 'rooted in craving.' Where the <i>Pāḷi</i> says: <i>'Taṇhāya pahānā kammam pahīyati. Kammassa pahānā dukkham pahīyati.</i> 'Letting go Thirst, <i>kamma</i> is let go. <i>Kamma</i> having been let go, pain is let go,' he has "By the abandoning of craving action (that is rooted in craving) is abandoned. By the abandoning of action (rooted in craving) Ill is abandoned." Which he justifies with the statement: "To say that action as such should be abandoned would be contrary to the Buddha's 'doctrine of the deed.'"<br />
					This is a misunderstanding. The <i>Pāḷi</i> does not say 'let go <i>kamma</i>', it says 'let go thirst'. The 'doctrine of the deed' is the view that <i>kamma</i> is a fact, that there are consequences that follow intentional acts. The view that there is no action necessary to become free from pain is 'the doctrine of non-action". To free one's self from pain it is necessary to act in a way which ends <i>kamma</i> (for the individual!) which is the intentional action of not acting in response to <i>taṇhā.</i> It is <i>kamma</i> which ends <i>kamma</i> and thus is not 'non-action.' The end result is the end of <i>kamma.</i><br />

					The Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> that there is no other single thing more effective at ridding one of the yokes to rebirth than the seven dimensions of awakening.<br />
					This sutta presents a big problem for translators, one similar to that found in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_01_ekanipata.htm">the Book of the Ones,</a> where the Buddha is making a statement that he does not know of another thing so effective at accomplishing a thing as such and such. And then he goes on to give another thing about which he says the same thing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Nāhaṃ bhikkhave, aññaṃ ekadhammam pi samanupassāmi yo evaṃ bhāvitā bahulīkatā||<br />
					saṇyojaniyānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya saṇvattanti.</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Yad idaṃ satta bojjhaṅgā.</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not, beggars, perceive another single thing, developed, made much of,<br />
					just so effective for letting go things that yoke to rebirth.<br />
					That is, the seven dimensions of awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">My previous way of resolving this problem was to word it: 'I do not perceive another single thing <i>more</i> ... . Thus allowing for another thing which is 'just as much.' But the problem is this is not in the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Woodward translates "I behold not, monks, any other single condition which ... is so..." Bhk. Bodhi: "I do not see even one other thing that ... . Both these translations leave one asking: Well what about the Eightfold Way? Or in the case of those cases found in the Book of the Ones, what about those other things?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what I believe is the case is that whether intentionally paradoxical or understood as a given or a feature of the language the meaning was that such and such was identical <i>'in essence'</i> with such another thing. That to say that to say: 'no other single thing is so effective as the seven dimensions of awakening' was in essence saying the same thing as 'no other single thing is so effective as the eightfold way' because the two things though using different words amount to the same thing.</p>

					Here, relating this to the previous sutta, we have a variation on the problem discussed <a href="#sn5.46.29">above.</a> How else would it be possible for both not being careless and tracing things back to their place of origin to be considered best of skillful things if they were not essentially the same thing? With Woodward that would be: earnestness = systematic attention; with Bhk. Bodhi: diligence = careful attention.</p>

					The Buddha is not able to halt the argument and contention of the <i>Saṅgha</i> in Ghosita's <i>vihara</i> in Kosambī and so moves on to visit Bhago in Balakallonakara village where he teaches him <i>Dhamma</i> and then he visits the Anuruddhas staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove there. There he teaches the Anuruddhas in great detail the process of eliminating the obstructions to clairvoyant sight and describes the method of <i>jhāna</i> practice in threes which he himself used to attain arahantship.<br />
					Anyone wishing to develop the <i>deva</i> eye or clairvoyance should be very interested in this sutta. It is also here that we see the actual meditation method used by Gotama. This 'method in threes' is:</p>

					<p class="f4">I.i. Develop serenity <i>(samādhi)</i> with thinking <i>(vitakka)</i> and pondering <i>(vicāra);</i><br />
					I.ii. Develop serenity without thinking, just a measure of pondering <i>(vicāra-matta);</i><br />
					I.iii. Develop serenity without thinking or pondering;<br />
					II.i. Develop serenity with enthusiasm <i>(pīti);</i><br />
					II.ii. Develop serenity settling down enthusiasm;<br />
					II.iii. Develop serenity in connection with happiness;<br />
					III.i. Develop serenity with detachment;<br />
					<i>[then, not stated as such, but I suggest are, the second and third parts of the third part:]</i><br />
					III.ii. by that attaining freedom,<br />
					and in freedom seeing freedom,<br />
					III.iii. arises the knowledge and vision:<br />
					'Unshakable is my heart's freedom,<br />
					this is the end of birth,<br />
					there is no further exististing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The over-all message of the sutta is that when the <i>bhikkhus</i> do not live in harmony with each other they obstruct their access to <i>Dhamma,</i> when they live in harmony access to <i>Dhamma</i> appears.</p>

Women still, for the most part, give up their names, and in the home are still expected to assume duties which amount to serving the man. Even in families with great wealth, where there are servants to do the actual work, the women's role is to supervise in this area. This sutta should be used by men to cultivate sympathy and empathy.<br />

					      <p class="fp4 in2"><i>Nelaṅgo setapacchādo||<br />
							ekāro vattatī ratho</i>|| ||</p>

							<p class="fp4 in2"><i>Anīghaṃ passa āyantaṃ||<br />

							<p class="f4">My translation and solution:</p>

      					<p class="f4 in2">Straight, transparent,<br />
							built here, rolling on —<br />
							the chariot —<br />
							see it smoothly guided<br />
							beyond the stream,<br />
							unbound.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Straight = ethical<br />
							transparent = without deceit, open, visible (covered in white would point to a layman which is unlikely); most likely meaning purity<br />
							built here = the set-up mind<br />
							rolling on = <i>saṇsara,</i> but also rolling on to the ending of <i>saṇsara</i><br />
							chariot = the own-made, the personal vehicle<br />
							smoothly guided = steared without the corrupting influences<br />
							beyond the stream = with thirst cut off<br />
							unbound = cut free of, losed, released.</p>

							<p class="f4">Since Citta's solution was not confirmed by the Buddha, and Kāmabhū may not have understood the solution himself (that is that he may have been asking Citta for a solution rather than posing the riddle (but see the next sutta where it appears that Kāmabhū is in fact a knowledgable <i>bhikkhu</i> who is instructing Citta);  — Kāmabhū does not actually say that Citta's solution is correct or in accordance with a solution given by the Buddha ... his remark to Citta may well have been a polite 'maybe.' Or it may be that Citta's solution, although not what he had in mind was nevertheless fair <i>Dhamma</i> and so he let it pass). I believe we are free to arrive at a different solution. My translation 'turns' on making the riddle both a description of the proper chariot and an instrucion as to what to do with it. If <i>'ekāro'</i> must be 'one-spoked' or 'one-wheeled' we can hear in that the sound of one hand clapping and not be too upset. Nizamis' solution is as forced as mine but more academically couched. (There is no √<i>ṛ</i> in <i>Pāḷi;</i> it would be <i>√kar</i> = 'make'. But there are those who believe Sanskrit to be the root language of <i>Pāḷi.</i> May they go in peace, make of it what they will.) (lidda didjadijajijjajok-khahaha)</p>

							<p class="f4">EDIT: [Thursday, July 09, 2015 6:55 AM] see on this <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.041-050.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.1.46">SN 1.1.4</a> where: straight = the name the Road is called;<br />
							Free-from-fear = the destination;<br />
							'Silent Runner' = the name of the Chariot;<br />
							the wheels = Righteous Effort;<br />
							the 'leaning board' = Conscience;<br />
							the drapery = non-carelessness;<br />
							the driver = the <i>Dhamma;</i><br />
							those that run before = Right Views (important persons traveled with troops in front and in back)</p>

							<p class="f4">Again see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.004.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.45.5</a> where the wheels are energy, the axle is enthusiasm (possibly the intent of <i>ekāro,</i> that is, one-axled); the drapery is desirlessness, and the car is 'built by self'.</p>

							<p class="f4">There seems to be a great deal of flexibility in giving meanings to the components of the chariot.</p>

					Citta asks the Venerable Kamabhu various questions about attaining the ending of perception and sense-experience.<br />
					A footnote in Woodward's translation states: "In the first <i>jhāna</i> speech ceases." He gives no citation for this statement, and in fact he may have been thinking of overt speech, but we can understand the meaning in a deeper way and see the absolute correctness of this statement by analyzing the situation. Since <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> are classified as speech (thinking through the construction of a statement precedes voicing it) and exist in the first <i>jhāna,</i> and these are eliminated prior to entering the second <i>jhāna,</i> that statement is to be understood to mean that at some point <i>in the first jhāna</i> speech is brought to an end with the result that one enters the second <i>jhāna.</i> <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi, in his note here states that speech ceases in the second <i>jhāna,</i> but this is contrary to every description of the second <i>jhāna</i> found in the suttas.</p>

							and makes a habitat<br />
							of the Second Knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>After</i> thinking has been pacified, or by the pacification of thinking, he <i>then</i> enters the second <i>jhāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">We are then able to apply this sequence to the manner in which the other factors are dropped in attaining the subsequent <i>jhānas</i>. The pleasure of enthusiasm is dropped <i>in</i> the second <i>jhāna</i> to attain the third <i>jhāna,</i> enthusiasm is dropped <i>in</i> the third <i>jhāna</i> to attain the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> and breathing is stopped <i>in</i> the fourth <i>jhāna.</i><br />
					The importance of all this is to note that when the breathing is said in translation to have ceased <i>'at' or 'upon attaining'</i> the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> what is to be understood is not that at the very first point of attaining the fourth <i>jhāna</i> the breathing immediately stops, (that is that there is no respiration in the fourth <i>jhāna</i>) but that it is there in that <i>jhāna</i> that the breathing is brought to an end. There is still breathing going on in at least the early stages of the fourth <i>jhāna.</i><br />
					This analysis also makes clear the fact that the <i>jhānas</i> are not static states or trances, 'other', undescribed states suddenly discovered upon fulfilling the instructions for the attaining of the <i>jhāna</i> and which have a fixed set of attributes, but are processes which undergo internal development or have evolving characteristics and whose characteristics are found in the descriptions we have of the attaining of the <i>jhānas.</i> In a way the standard descriptions are being wrongly divided. The description of the essential aspect of what is going on in the first <i>jhāna</i> for example, is found as the process of attaining the second <i>jhāna,</i> and so forth.</p>

					Our lives today [Wednesday, June 24, 2015 6:23 AM] are so bound up in 'entertainments' such as movies and plays and novels and we make such heros of those involved in their production or in their performance that it is most disagreable to confront the fact that these are vehicles which depend on the practice of saying what is not true and lead those who are already deluded to become moreso, lead those who are already bound up in lusts to become moreso, lead those who are already bound up in hateful, angry, violent thoughts to become moreso. Is it a wonder then that those who produce and perform in such entertainments find rebirth again in the destiny of those who lead others astray through the lie? Worse still is holding that such performances are a good thing and lead to rebirth in heavenly states, for that is a wrong view, and a wrong view results in one of two rebirths: as an animal or in hell.<br />
					Be very careful, by the way, if you have an actor, director, writer friend you would like to help. Their careers ... lives, are bound up in their occupation and the likely result will be anger at you and casting you as a deluded religious fanatic.

					<p class="f4">As far as the rules for <i>bhikkhus</i> go, this is an offence of expiation. [<i>Vin. Cullavagga Xii; Sutta Vibhaṅga Nissaggiya Pācittiya xviii</i>] The rule states: [Horner, transl.]: <i>Whatever monk should take gold and silver, or should get another to take it (for him), or should consent to its being kept in deposit (for him), there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Today [Friday, June 26, 2015 12:33 PM] there are <i>bhikkhus</i> who accept money directly and there is a widespread practice of having some lay person accept money for a <i>bhikkhu</i> or for the <i>Saṅgha</i> ... that is, being kept in deposit for him or them.</p>

					<p class="f4">For such <i>bhikkhus</i> and abbots we must leave this to their own conscience and the scruples of their <i>saṅghas.</i> For the layman seeking to gain good <i>kamma</i> we need to consider the statement that such a one is not considered a recluse by nature, nor is he of the nature of the Sakyan's sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">The idea is very simple: If there is money being accepted, what follows from that is at a level that is below that of the <i>bhikkhu</i> as a 'son of the Sakkyan; that is, one who has the true spirit of the <i>bhikkhu.</i> Whatever flows from that money stains the life of the <i>bhikkhu.</i> Make up your own mind as to whether or not this is worth the doing, but don't fool yourself, or let yourself be fooled into thinking that you are making great piles of good <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The fine point is that you are not giving to the <i>bhikkhu</i> at all. A gift given through an intermediary is a gift given to the intermediary, not the <i>bhikkhu.</i> This is not the same thing as a group of people pooling their money to do some deed for a <i>bhikkhu</i> or the <i>Saṅgha.</i> Its a matter of where the intent originates.</p>

					Identical with the previous with the one change of terms. Note this way of describing <i>samādhi.</i> <i>Vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> are sorts of thinking. According to a note in Bhk.

Names can be applied where useful, but tend, as we can see, to become rigid and demanding. The first is highly verbal (re-talking); the second is dwelling on an idea which may be done visually without any verbalization. The idea of 'directed thought and sustained thought' comes from early attempts to understand the terms as described by the commentaries, taking the description of what it feels like and turning that into technical terms and then using those as the translation. The idea is compared with initial effort of a bird to fly compared with its having attained flight. This implies a progression from 'initial thought' to 'sustained thought'. My perception is that verbal thought <i>follows</i> visual thought. That would be that <i>Vitakka</i> follows <i>Vicara. Vitakka</i> is the putting into coherent thoughts names arising off sequences of images. This is my perception, but the logic also dictates that this must be the case. How could one have sustained thoughts without first having directed thoughts (or initial thought) (as in the second form of this type of <b>jhāna</b>) if it is a progression? First we have a picture of something and we think it would be something worth expressing in words, then we formulate the words. There is a point in the thinking process where there is 'a train of thought' which sustains itself (so there is 'sustained thought', but that is not a translation) and one is more or less just an observer, but is this <i>arriving at,</i> or arriving <i>back at</i> ... that is, the result of letting go of the obstruction of 'sustained thought' by that which is <i>vitakka?</i> The second level is described by Woodward as 'without directed but just with sustained thought' by Bhk. Bodhi has '... with examination only.' <i>'Avitakka-vicāra-matto'</i> <i>'matta'</i> = measure. A bit of, not "just with" or "only." Bhk. Bodhi supplies references (also found in Ms. Horner's translation of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.128.horn.pts.htm">MN 128</a> (also <a href="#mn.128">see above</a>) to other suttas using this three-dimensional description of <i>samādhi,</i> <i>e.g.,</i> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.33.03.olds.bd.htm#p3.50">DN 33.03</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p128">MN 128</a> (Where this three-fold <i>samādhi</i> is said by the Buddha to have been his method for attaining Arahantship) and <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p63">AN IV 300.</a><br />

					The numbering of this sutta and the sub-sections within it are confused between versions. Woodward has numbered this as §12(2) but there seems no justification for that. I have changed the number and the number of the suttas that follow in this Chapter and have noted such in the Index. Otherwise he has worked out the scheme of subheadings in the most logical way. Bhk. Bodhi has it that the sutta is a re-working, with the one change, of suttas 1-12. Woodward has it that it is this reworking but with suttas 1 <i>and</i> 12. Sutta 1 is the only sutta of the first 11 which is not duplicated in 12. Also it is a good umbrella sutta for the rest. This makes the scheme look like: 1 and 2-11; 12 = 2-11 (with components each taking one sub-section, i.e., section 2 which is <i>samatha</i> and <i>vipassana</i> in §2 separates <i>samatha</i> and <i>vipassana</i> into two sub-sections in §12; 13 (and the following) then take the form: 1+12. While there is repetition in the suttas duplication is rare. I have followed Woodward's scheme in rendering the unabridgment of this sutta in his translation and in the <i>Pāḷi.</i> I have left Bhk. Bodhi's abridgment as it is per the copyright restrictions.<br />

Vaccha then goes to the Buddha and puts the same questions and receives the same answers.<br />
					This is one of the places which I have here and there mentioned where the <i>bhikkhus</i> themselves, at the time, remark on the fact that both disciples and the Buddha use the same wording and phrasing when responding to the same questions. I suggest this is because the most precise wording and phrasing with regard to questions and answers has been worked out and so is not a matter of remembering what the Buddha Said, but of responding in accordance with the most precise understanding. I further suggest that we can often and should try to find such precise wording in our English translations and that that is the way the doctrine will be most profitably understood.<br />

					The Buddha speaks to the issue of the need to understand one's past deeds before one is able to attain Arahantship. He suggests development of the heart of friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment.<br />
					Bhikkhu Bodhi's understanding of a sutta which I have found very difficult to reach confidence that I have understood it well. I do not agree with Bhk. Bodhi's understanding which seems to have been based on the commentary. The Buddha says that we must understand our past deeds before we can bring <i>kamma</i> to an end and that we must bring <i>kamma</i> to an end before we can attain Arahantship. Is he speaking of 'experiencing the consequences' or 'understanding the nature'? What is the meaning of his suggestion, made, if taken as given, to appear to be a solution to the idea of experiencing one's <i>kamma</i> prior to rebirth in another realm, to practice the <i>brahma-viharas?</i> I believe the idea is that practicing the <i>brahma-viharas</i> here, they will be beset by; that is they will continually confront; the consequences of one's past deeds and that by comparing the joy of the <i>brahma-vihara</i> with the results of <i>kamma</i> one will come to an understanding of the nature of all <i>kamma</i> and the need to abandon deeds. Here you have an ideal opportunity to compare several points of view. Judge for yourself!</p>

							If you slouch forward the magic carpet will tip forward and dump you off.<br />
							If you slouch twisting to the left the magic carpet will twist to the left and dump you off.<br />

							If you arch to the left the magic carpet will twist to the left and dump you off.<br />
							If you arch to the right the magic carpet will twist to the right and dump you off.<br />
							If you fall asleep you will slump.<br />
							If you are taken up by a train of thought you will twist.<br />
							If you are perfectly balanced, focused and alert the magic carpet will fly in whatsoever direction you <i>wish</i><br />

					<p class="f4"><i>"Feisal brought nationality to their minds in a phrase, which set them thinking of Arab history and language; then he dropped into silence for a moment: for with these illiterate masters of the tongue words were lively, and they liked to savour each, unmingled, on the plate. Another phrase showed them the spirit of Feisal, their fellow and leader, sacrificing everything for the national freedom; and then silence again, while they imagined him day and night in his tent, teaching, preaching, ordering and making friends: and they felt somethhing of the idea behind this pictured man sitting there  iconically, drained of desires, ambitions, weakness, faults; so rich a personality enslaved by an abstraction, made one-eyed, one armed, with the one sense and purpose, to live or die in its service."</i></p>

					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> about old <i>kamma,</i>  new <i>kamma</i> and the way to end <i>kamma.</i><br />
					The important thing here is to grasp the idea of <i>kamma</i> as both the product of action and the action which brought about that product. This is not the same thing as our 'action' and 'result' as conceived of as discrete events in Time as reflected in our English construction 'subject, verb, object' — the one term stands for both. Understanding this will help clarify the understanding of <i>'saṅkhāra'</i> which is also the 'doing' and the result. Having grasped this way of seeing the world as flow of consciousness through a series of apparently (apparently only) static events consisting of action and consequence, it will become clear why, as in this sutta, the Buddha felt it necessary to define what, precisely it is that is profitably considered the past and what the present, that is, that that part of the event which consists of the eye and objects should be thought of as the past; that part of it that is the action of doing should be considered to be the present. (I know! Your perception is that action occurs now and consequences follow later in time; but that perception is a consequence of your being 'in-volved' in the world. Outside, apart from involvement, the perception is different than that. It is, in fact, your perception of action as 'the present' and consequences as 'the future' that binds you to Time and identification with the 'actor'. It is the Buddha's description of this construction that is, in fact, the key to unlocking the door to this higher perception.) Then the lesson is completed by pointing out the way to stop the flow by following the <i>Magga.</i><br />

					A <i>bhikkhu</i> questions a number of <i>bhikkhus</i> about the nature of perfection and receives different answers from each. Consulting the Buddha it is explained that there are many different approaches to <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					The simile of a tree seen at different seasons of the year is given for the idea of different views of the approach to <i>Nibbāna.</i> The different approaches mentioned are: seeing the arising and passing away of the sense experiences; seeing the arising and passing away of the stockpiles of fuel <i>(khandhas);</i> seeing the arising and passing away of the four great characteristics (earth, water, firelight and wind); and seeing that whatsoever comes into existence is something that must go out of existence. Note that the last one is usually found as the formula for Streamwinning. In other words, though that is the insight gained at the entrance to Streamwinning, it is also a path all the way to <i>Nibbāna.</i> Then the Buddha gives another simile to illustrate the idea of different approaches while given another approach which is more fundamental, general and encompassing than the others, that is, following the Eightfold Path. He describes a king's fortress with six gates and a gatekeeper and the visitation by 'a swift pair of messengers' who deliver the truth to the king who sits at the crossroads. The terms of the simile are defined. Note that 'the swift pair of messengers' are the practices of 'calm' and 'insight'. Not just one or the other, but both.<br />

					The Buddha teaches the <i>bhikkhus</i> two similes: one for understanding the way mindfulness works to develop control over the inclination to indulge in sense pleasures, and the other, the famous simile of the Lute, to illustrate the emptiness of the pleasures of the senses.<br />
					This is an exquisite sutta to invision. Picture the field of ripe corn and then the cow and her delight in finding such a sumptuous meal only to end up being brow-beaten again and again until she learns to associate the field of corn with the beating, then imagine the somewhat feebleminded king, fascinated by the enchanting sounds of the lute and in a wonderfully thick-headed way searching for the sounds in the lute itself, taking it apart and not finding the sounds, in disgust shattering it to bits. The one simile folds right into the other and the combination blossoms out into a powerful lesson. This is our dilemma. Its like the smoker who knows smoking is bad for him and will lead him to a painful end but who must, to quit, engage in an enormous battle with his desire to smoke. Just understanding the problem of pain in existence and rebirth isn't enough. We need to break the habit and the way that is done is to so investigate the nature of sense pleasures that we see that they always, inevitably lead to a brow-beating. Its only at the point where we abandon all hope that there is a way to engage in pleasure of the senses without suffering the beating that we finaly reach the resigned detachment that is the freedom of <i>Nibbāna.</i> "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!" This is the subtle trickery of Māra, that we read this as the sign over the entrance to hell, when it is the sign over the entrance to <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />

					The Buddha teaches a simile for the control of the six senses by way of contrasting the result of tying each of six different animals with six different tastes when they are each tied to the others versus when they are each tied to a central stake.<br />
					In the first case the animals, when tired of struggling against each other follow the strongest of them whereas when they are all tied to the central stake they cease to struggle at all.<br />
					Something similar to the way mankind switched from following war-lords to following the rule of law ... only mankind, being what it is (a blight on the face of the earth), seeing that laws were made by ignorant men, in the service of their avarice, not righteousness, turned its struggle to subverting the rule of law.<br />
					Nevertheless, should one sincerely seek to free one's self from the domination of the senses, the lesson here points to the value of subjecting one's self to the discipline of minding the gates to embodyment <i>(kāyagatā sati)</i> (i.e., the senses).<br />
					The opening passage of this sutta is problematic and I believe the point has been missed (or at least has not been made clear) by Woodward, Bhkkhu Thanissaro and <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi. I suggest the idea (not a translation) is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as a man with a festering wound when entering a jungle of thorns would come to pain resulting from the thorns scratching at his wound,<br />
					so a beggar retires from the world and finds there a person who accosts him saying:<br />
					"You, behaving as you do, are a blight on the face of the earth!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is how this should be understood:<br />

					Both the common person and the Arahant undergo painful experiences, pleasant experiencess and experiences that are not painful but not pleasant. The Buddha explains that the difference between the two is that the Arahant does not add to his pain by an emotional or 'follow-on' component.<br />
					Here I believe we have illustrated a very clear idea of what is meant by <i>'anusaya'</i> (Woodward's 'lurking tendency'; Bhk. Bodhi and Nanaponika Thera: 'underlying tendency'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'resistant obsession'. It is simply put, the emotional (heart-felt) mental attitude that arises subsequent (following after, <i>'anu'</i>) to an experience. The 'follow-on' experience. Experiencing pain the <i>anusaya</i> is a mental attitude of repugnance. Experiencing pleasure the <i>anusaya</i> is a mental attitude of attachment to plesant sense experience. Experiencing what is not unpleasant-but-not-pleasant the <i>anusaya</i> is blindness.<br />
					Blindness as a reaction to experiencess that are not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant may not be seen by some as 'emotional', but this should be understood as per Websters: emotion 2a: the affective aspect of consciousness, feeling; and b: a reaction of or effect upon this aspect of consciousness. The common person reacts to this sort of experience with the desire to escape it in the experience of pleasure, hence his <i>anusaya</i> is blindness to the outcome.<br />

					It is interesting to note the difference in customs and culture between our own and the Buddha's time as can be seen in this sutta. If someone today were to walk into a ward for the terminally ill and deliver a sermon on being prepared to die he would be thought to be in very poor taste ... and as a result of respecting this convention those who were in fact facing immanent death would not hear what they needed to hear. For whose sake, for whose comfort in blindness, then, is our custom of never mentioning death to the dying? Of course our situation is so twisted up today [Sunday, May 31, 2015 8:25 AM] that the dying themselves would become offended at this 'behavior in bad taste'.<br />

					Identical with the previous sutta with 'contact' <i>(phassa)</i> being substituted for 'body'. Nyanaponika Thera has footnoted that <i>'phassa'</i> (which he translates as 'sense-impression') is 'mental factor and does not signify physical impingement'. I don't know where he gets this idea. First the literal translation of <i>'phassa'</i> is 'touch'. It is understood to be the contact of a sense object with a sense organ <i>together with consciousness.</i> And here it is, if contrasted with the previous sutta, a synonym for 'body'. Surely this is physical or at most physical/mental impingement. The reverse would actually imply the creation of the sense organ and object by its own sense-consciousness ... <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_011.pajapatis.problem.htm">Pajapati's error.</a> "Own-eye-impact, beggars, comes to be as a result of eye data, it is not that eye data comes to be as a result of own-eye-impact," <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.14.003.olds.bd.htm">SN 2.14.3</a> (and <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_14_dhatusamyutta.htm#p1">the entire <i>vagga.</i></a><br />
					If what Nyanaponika Thera is saying is that <i>'phassa'</i> is to be defined as 'the <i>experience</i> of contact,' (which would be a mental factor) this does not comport with this very sutta which is saying that the experience, <i>'vedana',</i> arises as a <i>consequence</i> of the contact.<br />
					My version of BJT has simply copied the previous sutta without making the appropriate changes. In fact my version of the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> has been very poorly edited throughout this volume. Perhaps this has been corrected in later editions, but be careful!<br />

					The Buddha explains his statement that whatsoever is sense-experience, that is of the nature of pain. Then he describes three progressions leading to Arahantship: that of a progression of endings; that of a progresion of masterings; and that of a progression of calmings-down.<br />
					The idea here is that the attaining of arahantship is gradual. There is a school of Zen Buddhism out there that speaks of sudden Awakening. This is another case where the subjective is ignored in the face of a perception which counts the subjective as insignificant, unreal. Like the struggle of an individual in a dream to wake up relative to his waking up. After awakening it appears that the progression towards awakening of the unawakened subjective individuality was insignificant, almost irrelevant. Almost. Except for the subjective individual for whom it is all important. There is no awakening without the intent to awaken. So although awakening may be sudden, when the idea is seen in its totality, awakening is gradual.<br />
					Here I have finally seen a convincing argument for translating <i>'saññā-vedayita-nirodha'</i> as 'the ending of perception and sense-experience'. This is how it is explained in this sutta, that is 'perception <i>and</i> sense experience' are ended. I have sometimes used this translation and sometimes used 'the ending of perception of sense experience.' The complication here for me has always been that there is perception <i>(saññā)</i> beyond the attaining of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception which I have taken to be the <i>'saññā-vedayita-nirodha'</i> which is described by Sāriputta as: "One perception arose in me: to end becoming is Nibbāna; another perception faded out in me: to end becoming is <i>Nibbāna.</i>" <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.007.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.7</a> And again, in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/10_tens/an10.006.olds.bd.htm">AN 10.6</a> The Buddha describes the highest state, the conclusion as having percption. Hense my understanding was that this <i>jhāna</i> ended sense-perception, but not all perception. Since that must still be the case however this term is translated, my understanding now is that the <i>'saññā-vedayita-nirodha'</i> is just another own-made mental state like all the other <i>jhānas</i> and though it may involve the ending of perception, that state too is not to be confused with <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />

					The Buddha likens the various sense experiences to the various sorts of guests that inhabit a guest house.<br />
					This sutta is one of the few places where the <i>vedanas</i> are described in the two modes found in the <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p11">Satipaṭṭhana Sutta.</a> It is very important to understand how this works. The sense experience produced by contact with an identical object or situation can be experienced in different, opposite ways depending on one's mental state, perspective or orientation. From the point of view of one letting go of the world, what would have produced a pleasant sense experience for one downbound to the world will be experienced as unpleasant (both in its nature as temptation, and as transient and leading inevitably to pain); what would have produced an unplesant sense experience will be experienced as plesant (because experienced as no longer pertaining to the self) and what would have been experienced as a neutral sense experience inclining the downbound to seek pleasant sense experience will be experienced by the renunciate as a taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i> For the one the experience is impersonal and mental and does not equate to our idea of 'sensation' but is more like 'idea'; for the other it is a subjective experience that is a mixture of bodily and mental sensations. Because of the need for the one word to satisfy both uses I suggest that <i>vedana</i> be translated not as 'sensation' but as 'sense experience' or just 'experience'. 'Feeling' which is the most frequent translation, but which does not relate to the literal meaning of <i>'vedana'</i> ('the given experience'), does serve both needs but I think points to or reveals experience of the uncarnal sort less forcefully.<br />

					<p class="f4">"When thou art alone in thy cell, shut thy door, and seat thyself in a corner; rise thy mind above all things vain and transitory; recline thy beard and chin on thy breast; turn thy eyes and thy thought towards the middle of thy belly, the region of the navel; and search the place of the heart, the seat of the soul. At first, all will be dark and comfortless; but if you presevere day and night, you will feel an ineffable joy; and no sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart, then it is involved in a mystic and etherial light."</p>

					<p class="f1">The practice of the monasteries of mount Athos c 1341, Mosheim, <i>Institut. Hist. Eccles.</i> p. 522, 523. Fleury, <i>Hist. Eccles.</i> tom. xx. p. 22. 24. 107-114, etc. quoted from Gibbon, <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,</i> Volume III, p. 783.<br />
					Note that if one 'places the beard and chin on one's breast and turns one eyes and thought towards the middle of one's belly, the region of the navel,' it has approximately the same effect as placing the mind <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sati.htm"><i>(sati)</i></a> around the mouth while sitting upright with the chin tucked in. Rising above all things vain and transitory = separating one self from the diversions <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm"><i>(Nīvaraṇā).</i></a> I am not saying the two practices are the same in intent or consequence, but the form of the meditation practice of these monks is virtually identical to the initial steps in <i>jhāna</i> practice.</p>

					<p class="f1">As a follow-up, this practice, which was the exclusive manner of prayer of a small group of monks called 'Quietists', was discovered by the wider Christian community, brought into the discussion of the substantiality of God (was this light material or immaterial and depending on that was this a legitimate vision of God or not) and became a raging debate among the people of Constantanople as well as among the ecclesiastics — (from the Buddhist perspective, bringing an intermediate result of a practice of letting go of the world into a discussion of existence or non-existence). After a great ruckass it was finally decided that it was a legitimate view of the eternal light of God. Gibbon, in his really witty way, ridicules the whole idea without having any personal experience of the practice: <i>"and, after so many insults, the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the addition of a single absurdity."</i> And the educated English of the world lost an opportunity to discover <i>jhāna</i> practice, for Gibbon was sacred wisdom right up until the end of WW I, where wisdom was abandoned altogether in the West.</p>

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.017.wood.pts.htm">Without Satisfaction,</a> the F.L. Woodward translation.<br />
					The Buddha explains that one must see the satisfactions, disadvantages, and the way of escape from the personal sense spheres in order to attain enlightenment.<br />
					The tendency is to think of the Buddha as teaching only that the world is miserable and one should give it up. Here one can see that what he is really saying is that it is necessary to see both the misery of the world and the pleasures to be found there and to compare the two. The conclusion of the wise will be that the world should be given up. Then, of course, it is necessary to understand how it can be given up.<br />
					Dig around and examine what you experience as the highest pleasure derived from sight, etc., the worst pain that results from seeing. If you do not do this thoroughly and objectively you will never convince yourself of the need to let go of the eye.<br />
					Eyes see your loved ones, your mother, your father, your sisters and brothers, friends and relatives, the form of the most beautiful lass in the land, <i>bhikkhus,</i> perhaps even a Buddha; eyes see the birth of your children, wonderful vistas, masses of people, sights of historical events, memorable events; eyes see beautiful things, works of art and imagination; it is with our eyes we find our food; eyes see your well done deeds prosper, they see the badly done deeds of your enemies cause them suffering, because of eyes we can read the <i>Dhamma</i> ... — Eyes are put out as punishments by poking red-hot stilletos into them; are goughed out with thumbs in fights, poked out by accident, are subject to diseases and produce salty watery tears that obstruct your meditation in old age, they see, in mirrors your own aging; eyes see your loved one's suffer pain, get old and die, they see one's you love betray you or ignore you; eyes see your deeds go unappreciated, the deeds of your enemies appreciated, they see your badly done deeds fail; eyes see ugly sights, horrific sights, terrifying sights; were it not for seeing would you risk all the dangers of living?<br />
					When looking into the satisfaction to be found in perception through the eye, try to find the ultimate satisfaction. e.g. "Because of the eye sense I am able to see sights that inspire to lofty emotions and ambitions." Don't just accept the idea that the eye yields pain. Conversely when examining the pain that is consequent on perception through the eye sense also look for the ultimate pain. <i>e.g.,</i> having seen sights with the eye that inspire lofty emotions and ambitions, acting on those emotions and ambitions the result is dissapointment, frustration, and the dangerous urge to try again in another birth. Putting the two sets of observations together, evaluate. Don't rationalize. Weigh. Its not: "But the pain is the price of the pleasure." (resignation) or "The pleasure is worth the pain." (A rationalization made in the absense of experience: always!) But: "I can see that accepting the pain with the pleasure is of a lower order than the escape (pain and pleasure are worldly, the aim of escape is getting beyond the worldly). I have not yet gained the pleasure of the highest order of worldly satisfaction, and I do not yet know the satisfaction of the higher order attained through freedom from the eye, but judging objectively the higher order should yield a greater satisfaction and I might not ever attain the highest order of worldly satisfaction. Let me then, facing these two alternative paths, aim towards attaining the higher order and see. At least if I fail this quest I will not berate myself for having chosen a low path."<br />
					This entire chapter (suttas 13-22), called the <i>Yamaka-vagga,</i> or the Twins Chapter, is made up of sets of two contrasting suttas one dealing with the internal or personal sense organs and the other dealing with the sense objects. The pairs should, of course, be read together. But it is interesting to question why they are presented separately in the first place. Were they actually delivered separately? It is conceivable. If the <i>bhikkhus</i> that were present were familiar with Gotama's methods they would know to expect the second sutta to follow at some point. That point might not be immediately after the delivery of the first sutta. Delay would serve to inhance retention of the idea. Create suspense of a sort. On the other hand it might just be that suttas throughout that were originally delivered in a unified form were broken up into separate 'suttas' just for the sake of achieving the legendary 84,000 suttas the Buddha is supposed to have delivered.<br />

					The Buddha describes what in his system accounts for absolutely everything in existence, calling it 'The All.'<br />
					Bhikkhu Thanissaro discusses in a footnote the question as to whether or not The All is intended to encompass <i>Nibbāna</i> and whether, if <i>Nibbāna</i> is not a <i>Dhamma,</i> it can be considered The Self.<br />
					The All describes all that which has been own-made, <i>(saṅkhāra-ed),</i> that which has become (or which has becoming), a development of the conjunction of <i>nāma/rūpa</i> with consciousness, what we call 'all existing things'; an equivalent of the <i>khandhas.</i> Beyond that there is no <i>thing</i> <i>(dhamma)</i> which can be said to have existence. <i>Nibbāna</i> on the other hand, is not own-made, it is not a <i>thing,</i> the consciousness arising from and conscious of named/shapes. So the All includes the individualized <i>(saṅkhāra-ed)</i> mind and <i>dhammas</i> (things) and <i>the idea</i> of <i>Nibbāna,</i> but not <i>Nibbāna.</i> Because <i>Nibbāna</i> is not-become, does not have existence as understood in this way, it is therefore impossible to <i>point to</i> it. It is not impossible or beyond anyone's scope to make the statement that the all includes the not-become or non-existent; an absurdity, I would argue, that would place one's mind's over the abyss.<br />

Bodhi: 'a way that is appropriate'. The second: <i>'Sappāya-Paṭipadā'</i> <i>'a walk to walk to begin'</i> <i>sappāya</i> &gt; SAṄ = with, own, con; + (according to PED) <i>pā</i> = pass, but possibly also + <i>pāya</i> &gt; <i>pā+ā+ya</i> = 'pass to whatever', 'to begin with'; PED: to start out; nstr. <i>pāyena</i> (adv.) for the most part, commonly, usually; PED: likely, beneficial, fit, suitable; Woodward: 'a way that is helpful'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'a way that is suitable'.

					The Buddha lists ten things that are aspects of the senses which when seen as they really are lead to dispassion and freedom from them leading to Arahantship.<br />
					Each of these things is <i>'-dhamma',</i> which both Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi translate 'subject to'. But this is torturing the word <i>'dhamma':</i> Woodward's note: <i>"<i>dhamma:</i> having the quality of, the rule of; hence 'subject to,' 'liable to.'"</i> The simple: "Is a rebirth-thing ... an aging-thing, etc." would do just as well.<br />
					There is in the series both the term <i>'jarā'</i> and <i>'vaya'.</i> Woodward translates: 'age' and 'growing old'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'aging' and 'vanishing'. <i>'jarā'</i> is most commonly encountered in the compound <i>'jarā-maraṇa'</i> usually translated 'aging and death';  The etymology of <i>'vayā'</i> found in PED is interesting: ... <i>vayo</i> (age) is connected with Sanskrit <i>vīra</i> = Latin <i>vir.</i> man, hero, vīs strength; Gr. <i>ἵς</i> sinew, <i>ἵϕιος</i> strong; Sanskrit <i>vīḍayati</i> to make fast, also <i>veshati;</i> whereas <i>vayas</i> (fowl) corresponds with Sanskrit <i>vayasa</i> (bird) and <i>vih.</i> to Gr. <i>αἱετός</i> eagle, <i>οἱωνόῤ</i> bird of prey, Latin <i>avis</i> bird] age, especially young age, prime, youth; meaning "old age" when characterized as such or contrasted to youth (the ord. term for old age being <i>jarā</i>). To form a more distinct difference we might translated <i>vaya:</i> 'weakening.'<br />

					The Buddha delivers a lecture on a method for the complete understanding of all that is comprised under the heading of 'set-ups'.<br />
					<i>Upādāna</i> is the things one does in response to sensation in order to re-experience the sensation or in order to get away from the sensation through other experiences. Here what is being spoken of is the entire spectrum of things that go into the blind setting up of rebirth: what it is that is to be understood in order to understand the real nature of setting up further existence. That is: it is through understanding the way sense experience arises that one conceives a distaste for sense experience and with that distaste thirst to re-experience or to escape by way of some other experience falls away and when this thirst falls away one is free, and in freedom the recognizing of that freedom is the freedom from setting up future rebirth.<br />
					Why does knowing/seeing that the eye and visible objects coming into contact giving rise to visual consciousness and that the union of the three is contact cause <i>'nibbindati'?</i> PED: <i>to get wearied of; to have enough of, be satiated, turn away from, to be disgusted with.</i> The term needs to be neutral. Woodward's 'repulsion' is a reaction. Reacting one is not free. The same applies to Bhk. Bodhi's 'revulsion'. It could be 'distaste' or 'disgust', meaning 'not having a taste for', which is not a 'doing'. The word is virtually identical in definition to 'satisfaction'. The idea at work is that seeing the senses in this way free's one from the notion that sense-experience is arising 'in me' or is being produced 'by me' or 'is me'. This is a solution, an escape from the problem of existing that we have been seeking. So it satisfies and there is naturally no further arising of any desire to jump back into the fire or the maelstrom. We don't need to see the whole world as 'revolting', we just need to see it as a trap that we have escaped.<br />

The fundamental notion however is that of substantiality, to which is closely related the specific Buddhist notion of impermanence <i>(loka = lujjati).</i></p>

					Upasena has been bitten by a snake and wishes to die outdoors. He is taken out and before he dies is questioned by Sariputta as to why it is that he shows no change in his sense-faculties or countenance. Upasena declares that there is not in him any idea of I-making or mine-making with regard to the senses.<br />
					Woodward translates the last part of the dialogue "Now the venerable Upasena had  ... Therefore the venerable Upasena had..." giving the impression that this is a comment being made by the narrator, but it is a comment being made in response to Upasena by Sariputta so I have altered it slightly to make that point clearer. I have noted this fact in a footnote. Bhk. Bodhi in his translation puts this more clearly.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.070.wood.pts.htm">Upavāṇa,</a> the F.L. Woodward translation.<br />
					The venerable Upavana inquires about the description of the <i>Dhamma</i> as being within view, timeless, come-see-able, leading-on, individually to be experienced by the cognizant.<br />
					This is a frequently-appearing description of the <i>Dhamma.</i> Here the meaning is shown to be that with this <i>Dhamma</i> one becomes aware of one's experiences at the senses, the lust that one has for sense experience, and the point when that lust no longer appears. This is, in a sequence that leads on, the experience in the individual of the problem, the solution, the method for its solution, and the realization of the goal. It is not a Teaching that asks one to believe or behave and wait for the result in some future life. It just needs to be said that what is intended here is not that one look at the <i>Dhamma</i> and snap fingers one is awakened. The idea is that at each step in the practice of what the <i>Dhamma</i> teaches (intellectual understanding, insight, letting go, freedom, realization of freedom) that degree of the <i>Dhamma</i> has been personally fulfilled and results to that degree a freedom from pain (the achievement of the goal) right there. Each step forward is a step into further freedom.<br />
					It is this phenomena of visible progress that so often leads the newcomer to believe that he has achieved the end when he has only just begun. Avoid grasping the snake in the wrong way! This <i>Dhamma</i> teaches absolute freedom. If you can see that there is still in your life some degree of captivity, you are not there yet.<br />

					The Buddha explains to a <i>bhikkhu</i> that seeing the six sense realms as not-self or belonging to the self is the end of pain.<br />
					A <i>bhikkhu</i> is thrown into doubt when the Buddha tells the <i>bhikkhus</i> that those who do not see the appearance, the retirement, the satisfaction and misery, and the escape from the sixfold sphere of contact do not understand the <i>Dhamma</i> or follow the Discipline, for he perceives himself as not yet seeing these things as they really are. Then when the Buddha asks him if he sees the eye as 'me', 'mine' 'my self' the <i>bhikkhu</i> answers he does not. And the Buddha says that there you have it, that seeing the eye in this way is the method for seeiing the the appearance, the retirement, the satisfaction and misery, and the escape from the eye, etc.<br />
					This is a good example of what was described in the previous sutta as <i>Dhamma</i> being within view, timeless, come-see-able, leading-on, individually to be experienced by the cognizant. At that time that the <i>bhikkhu</i> sees the eye, etc. as 'Not me, not mine, not my self' he has entered the path and sees the appearance, the retirement, the satisfaction, the misery and the escape from the eye, etc. When he doesn't, he isn't and doesn't.

					A group of <i>bhikkhus</i> inquires as to how they should answer when questioned as to the point of the Buddha's teaching.<br />
					The PTS text and Woodward's translation mis-title this sutta. It should be 'A number of bhikkhus' (per Bhk. Bodhi), or 'A group' or 'many' or 'a gathering'.<br />
					Additionally a portion of the <i>bhikkhus</i> question is very difficult to hear. The <i>Bhikkhus</i> ask how they should answer so that ... (There are three possible issues): 1. we are not reproached for misrepresenting his teachings; 2. that others repeating what we have said are not reproached for misrepresenting his teachings; 3. that the teachings themselves are not criticised by one believing what we have said):<br />
					Woodward has them saying: [we hope we have answered] "so that no one who agrees with his teaching and follows his views might incur reproach?"<br />
					If the entire statement is held together in mind as Woodward translates, it can be heard: <i>'so that no one who agrees with his teaching and follows his views </i> as we have answered would incur reproach' which could be heard as applying both to the speakers and to anyone who might repeat what they have said. Otherwise this should read: "so that no one who agrees with his teaching and follows his views might reproach us. Or: so that we might not incur the reproach of one who agrees with his teaching and follows his views. Or: so that no one repeating it might incur the reproach of one who agrees with his teaching and follows his views.' But this does not cover the third possible meaning.<br />
					Bhk Bodhi notes commentary: <i>"Spk. explains: 'How (should we answer) so that not the slightest consequence or implication of the ascetic Gotama's assertion — (a consequence) which is reasonable because of the reason stated — might give ground for criticism"</i> [by] <i>This is meant: "How can there be no ground for criticism in any way of the ascetic Gotama's asertion?" I dissent from Spk on what is to be safeguarded against criticism: Spk takes it to be the Buddha's assertion, while I understand it to be the inquirer's account of the Buddha's assertion. In other words, the inquirer wants to be sure he is representing the Buddha's position correctly, whether or not he agrees with it."</i> Bhk. Bodhi has: <i>"'that no reasonable consequence of our assertion gives ground for criticism.'"</i> which, in spite of Bhk. Bodhi's understanding of his own words, solves all three issues, as does the <i>uninterpreted</i> reading of Spk.<br />
					Tempest in a teapot. Mountain out of molehill. Much ado about nothing. Or concern about getting things expressed precisely so that down the road those who follow and understand the true teaching will not have reason to criticise us; or so that those who follow who do not have good understanding will not be mislead; or so that those who, without understanding the true teaching, follow, taking what we have said as gospel, will not criticise the teacher.<br />
					This concern is what this sutta is all about.<br />

					Sariputta and Mahā Cunda visit Channa who is dying a painful death. Channa announces he will 'take the knife' (commit suicide). Sariputta questions him as to his understanding of <i>Dhamma</i> and Mahā Cunda recites for him a saying of the Buddha warning against the wavering that results from attachments. Later, after Channa has 'taken the knife' Sariputta questions the Buddha as to Channa's fate. The Buddha states that his was a blameless end.<br />
					The question of suicide comes up periodically and is worth examining carefully. To the best of my understanding to this point this is an outline of the factors involved:<br />
					'Blameability' here means incurring a bad <i>kammic</i> outcome. This result rests on the idea that a. 'this' is not the self and consequently b. killing 'this' is ranked with murder.<br />
					This is the outcome for anyone who, killing this body, ends up taking up rebirth in another body.<br />
					This means that a blameable outcome is to be expected for anyone who commits suicide who is at that time less advanced than the non-returner who is able to attain arahantship at death.<br />
					Arahants do not commit suicide as they do not experience pain in a way which interfears with their mental stability (which is the excuse that justifies suicide for the person who does not incur blame for suicide.)<br />
					The suttas do not go into the outcome for the lesser cases of suicide, but one can extrapolate from related situations that the degree of bad outcome is modified to the extent of an individual's ability to comprehend the situation in terms of the <i>Dhamma,</i> and his ability to let go of attachments, at the point of or shortly after death but before taking up a new birth.<br />
					In this sutta both Sariputta and Mahā Cunda doubt Channa's understanding, both apparently basing their doubt on Channa's fondness for the company of laymen. The Buddha explains that although such attachment is a dangerous thing, it is the taking of one's own life for the sake of taking up rebirth in another body that is the issue in the case of suicide. Channa was above this error and knew he was above such an error.<br />

					The Buddha gives Mālunkya-putta a teaching in brief which inspires him to attain arahantship.<br />
					This is a well-known sutta which is the source of a catch-phrase-teaching of Zen Buddhism. The Buddha first asks Mālunkya-putta if he has any desire for sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, or things that he has never seen or heard of before. In other words not yet even imagined. This is a difficult idea to grasp. It is essentially saying that the past and the present are past, and that the future is completely unknown. It is a fresh, blank tablet if one's mind is taken off the desire for repeating past experiences. Then, seeing this way, abandoning the views and opinions and biases concerning things of the past, that which is seen, heard, sensed, and become conscious can be experienced thus (the zen catch-phrase in full context):</p>

					<p class="f4">"... in what is seen<br />
					there will be only the seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">"diṭṭhe diṭṭha-mattaṃ bhavissati,"<br />
					(no 'you will have' as per Woodward just 'there will be'.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what is heard<br />
					there will be only what is heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the sensed<br />
					there will be only what is sensed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the cognized<br />
					there will be only what is cognized.</p>

					<p class="f4">When in what is seen<br />
					there is only the seen;<br />
					in what is heard<br />
					there is only what is heard;<br />
					in the sensed<br />
					there is only what is sensed;<br />
					in the cognized<br />
					there is only what is cognized;<br />
					there is no 'you' Mālunkya-putta 'by this'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no 'you' Mālunkya-putta 'by this,'<br />
					there is no 'you' Mālunkya-putta 'there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no 'you' Mālunkya-putta 'there,'<br />
					it follows that there will be no 'you' experience,<br />
					no thrusting forward,<br />
					no waffling-around like a philosopher.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that is the end of <i>dukkha.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">I agree with Bhiks Thanissaro and Bodhi that what is being spoken about is not the 'having' of no 'by this-ness' by  Mālunkya-putta as Woodward has it, but the having of no 'you' by or through or because of that 'this'. Further than that my understanding of the next paragraph departs radically from the understanding of all three translators. Reader beware!</p>

					The sutta uses puns and depends on understanding the terms <i>'yoga'</i> and <i>'pariyāya'</i>. <i>'Yoga'</i> in its literal meanings as 'yoke' (as the yoke of a beast of burden to its burden') and figuratively as 'devotion' or 'application' to a task. <i>'Pariyaya'</i> means 'pass-round-whatsoever-whatsoever'. Most frequently in the sense of curriculum, or course. But it also means 'in general.' 'everything whatever'. The idea is along the lines of 'abandonging desire through desire to abandon desire;' 'yoked to abandonging the senses one abandons the yokes of the senses.'

They scour off every contaminant. Here in order to understand how seeing that the senses are changeable and painful eliminates judgments of superiority and inferiority, one must first grasp the idea (which is not stated overtly, you have to work at it) that the senses, being changeable and painful cannot rightly be considered 'self'. Without 'self' there is no evaluation of 'self' and 'other'. Think of these suttas as a soft cloth that is polishing, polishing, polishing away everything that is obstructing your vision.

					Because of the distinction made here between the fuel and the thing that makes the fuel fuel living, or between that which supports life and that which makes those supports support life, these are two (four) very good suttas to use to batter out your personal um ... grasp/understanding/translation of <i>'upādāna'</i>. Grasping works. 'The eye is the thing grasped, the lust is the grasping." Bhk. Bodhi: 'The eye is a thing that can be clung to, the desire and lust for it is the clinging there.' But I don't think the idea is 'clinging' either in regard to the <i>khandhas</i> or in its place in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i> This word must stand for 'going after or supporting or fueling getting' or 'going towards, supporting, fueling making' not trying to keep, hang on to, what has already been got.<br />

If you approach this <i>Dhamma</i> thinking its going to be a snap, or that it will make everything here right, beautiful and pleasant and easy, you are going to snap and be unjustifiably dissapointed and all the gods will have to say about you in that state is that you are indulging yourself in self-pity. You need to develop the heart of the hero. The sensation of having huge lungs, vast and irresistable strength. Very similar to the mind-set of the martyr, without the masochism — the determination to penetrate through to the achievement of the goal no matter what must be sacrificed here in this world. This is not the heart of a small man trying to trudge up an impossibly steep hill. Take hold. Put yourself in charge. There is no obstacle you cannot overcome! <a href="../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">This is the Way!</a> Everything you learn and practice in this system moves you ahead, but it is absolutely vital to keep the task in perspective.

If when you fall back you acknowledge your weaknesses you will be able to regain the system by re-examining your behavior and understanding of the system.

					Udena, the king of the <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_vamsa">Vaṇsas,</a> questions the venerable Bharadvaja as to why respectable young men of family would renounce the world and live their entire lives as beggars in the <i>Dhamma</i> taught by Gotama. Bharadvaja provides him with several answers the last of which satisfies the king who then becomes a lay follower.<br />
					A point of interest here is the translation of the first response where Bharadvaja quotes the Buddha as teaching that the <i>bhikkhu</i> should <i>mātu-mattīsu mātu-cittaṃ upaṭṭhapetha</i> 'for the mother-measured mother-heart set up'. Woodward: <i>"In the case of those who are just mothers, sisters and daughters, do ye call up the mother-mind, the sister-mind, the daughter-mind."</i> Towards those considered (measured as, reckoned to be; Woodward's 'just' = 'a measure of') mothers, set up the heart as towards a mother, etc. Per Bhk. Bodhi: "towards women old enough to be your mother set up the idea that they are your mother." Bhk. Thanissaro: "with regard to women who are old enough to be your mother, establish the attitude you would have toward your mother." The idea 'old enough,' presumably the translation for 'measured as,' is pushing a narrow idea onto the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Its 'measuring'. Taking into consideration all impressions together there is a similarity to ... . Think of the custom in countries like China and India where those towards whom one has feelings as towards a mother, father, uncle, brother, sister, daughter, are so called even between strangers. The idea here is 'who are similar to'. Age will be one factor of many. The idea that the mental attitude is to be the one one has for one's own mother, etc. is also not indicated but is being picked up from commentary. <i>That</i> could be a dangerous proposition! (as is pointed out by the king in response). Both sons, brothers and fathers and mothers, sisters and daughters are subject to deviant thoughts and feelings about each other. The idea is to set up the <i>ideal</i> way one <i>should</i> consider mothers, etc.<br />
					This sutta is being delivered by the <i>bhikkhu</i> named by the Buddha as one who is best at uttering a 'lion's roar'. In the case of this <i>bhikkhu</i> his lion's roar is that he is able to answer the questions of anyone concerning the paths and benefits from Streamwinner to Arahant. This sutta however does not seem to show him at such a high level as his first two answers are both incomplete responses to the question and ineffective in satisfying the King.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm">The Sublime Story,</a> the Rhys Davids, T. and C., translation.<br />
					The Buddha gives the <i>bhikkhus</i> a comprehensive course on his system through the lens of seeing the lives of the previous seven Buddhas.<br />
					Like other suttas, this one reveals itself in a completely different light when unabridged. It is essential to understand the repetitions as vital tools in conditioning the mind to reception of ideas which will completely change an individual's perception of the world. It is just at that point where the reader finds it unbearable to read what he has already read twice or three times before that <i>the listener</i> is brought into another dimension. I suggest that that other dimension is the attainment of the <i>jhānas.</i> A point where the individual's ego relaxes his grip on his normal reality and can accept new possibilities. This experience can only be duplicated in the reader if he forces himself to relax and imagines himself in the place of the listener. This opportunity is completely lost with abridgment and with that loss also is lost the opportunity to accept as real experience what is in the ordinary world acceptable only as 'childish myth' or, as Rhys Davids would have it the root of the weed which would eventually overwhelm the original teaching and bring it down.<br />
					But this sutta contains in fact a complete course in the doctrine from a version of the gradual course to the four truths to a very enlightening exposition of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i><br />
					The knee-jerk reaction of the critical reader will immediately dismiss as absurd myth the idea that there were, if there even were, seven previous Buddhas who all experienced birth, renunciation of the world, awakening and the events leading to the teaching of the <i>Dhamma</i> in virtually identical ways. But with even casual observation one will note in one's own life that there are thousands of episodes which repeat themselves in identical ways. People repeat the same stories over and over. Not only old people but everyone. I have seen myself in situations where the circumstances and dialogue were identical with those of a few years previous. Read a history of China, The History of the Fall of the Roman Empire, The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich, the story of Napoleon. History is an absurd story of nearly identically repeating episodes. Truly <i>'a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'</i> It is in the nature of the world to repeat itself. Repetition until mutation is the first operating principle of our DNA. Why should we think that the world at large operates differently? That there is in this world an expansion into virtually every permutation of every possibility is visible if you look. That there are as a result heavens and hells is the predictable natural result which is denied only by the narrow 'scientific, rational' mind that cannot see its nose in front of its face. That this evolution of possibilities also contains a principle of perfection in what we call an Awakened being is not that difficult to accept. That this principle evolves upward in relatively similar ways is also reasonable. That one does not 'see' this reflects only on one's own taming, training and education. At least, the <i>truly</i> 'rational' individual should allow for the possibility. Relax, someone who has seen it for themselves is speaking to you in this sutta. Listen with an unbiased ear and you may 'see.'<br />
					This leads to the question of the term to be used for this phenomena of seeing the past lives of others. It cannot properly be 'recollection' or 'memory' as those are terms indicating the recollection of experiences personally witnessed at the time. What we have here is the seeing of events that were not personally witnessed. The <i>Pāḷi</i> is: <i>'suppaṭividdhattā'</i> <i>su</i> = well; <i>paṭi</i> = reflect; <i>viddha</i> = having had penetrating knowledge (intuited);<br />
					what is 'penetrated' or 'intuited' is <i>dhamma-dhātuyā;</i> not, I suggest 'a principle of the truth' or <i>'Dhamma,'</i> but data or information concerning the nature of things in general — What I am suggesting above: that with an open mind one sees the repetititve nature of the things in the world and so seeing, and not obstructing such a view by dismissal as 'myth', one is able to see and differentiate between what to the ordinary 'seer' looks like one fuzzy event, the overlaping of multiple events. We can see also, the reverse. That say, for example, the history of Europe as one simple story repeating itself over and over. After a brief experiment in good government, psychopathic brute or psychopathic benevolant dictator or inbred idiot child rises up through the ranks of the army or inherits rule, takes control of the government, kills his enemies or not, takes many wives or not, has children or not, gives laws that make sense or not, indulges in cruelty, persecution of some enemy, conquest of other nations, indulgence of the senses or lives an ascetic life, kills his children and friends for conspiring against his life, is betrayed by his children and friends, is assassinated or exiled in luxory. Once or twice in a thousand years there is a good ruler. Once or twice in a thousand years an experiment in good govenment. Mostly not. Hitler and Napoleon are two sides of the same coin. When the good ruler dies his legacy is lost. When the initial excitement of a new good government wears off and becomes ordinary some psychopathic brute or some psychopathic benevolant dictator ... Rince and repeat. Why should the story of Awakening be any different? That is in terms of its repetitive nature? A cosmic principle of Awakening in juxtaposition to the cosmic principle of Blindness.<br />
					Rhys Davids: 'through clear discernment of a principle of the truth ... that he is able to remember;' Walshe: 'understands ... by his own penetration of the principles of <i>Dhamma.</i>'<br />
					In this regard also the reader, when Rhys Davids (and following him, Walshe) speaks of the 'rule', what is being translated is 'the <i>Dhamma</i>', which should be heard in this case as 'the form' or 'the pattern' or at least 'the general rule.'<br />
					The numbering of the sections agrees in no two versions of this sutta. I have numbered the sections according as it appears to me the text is usually broken up.<br />
					Rhys Davids ends this sutta with a reading I believe is mistaken. In this case the Buddha has just gone to visit the <i>Aviha</i> heaven where groups of <i>devas</i> there approach and announce to him the details of the lives of the seven Buddhas including Gotama, (each group having been the disciples of the Buddha about whom they speak). The <i>Pāḷi</i> and Rhys Davids both abridge giving the details for the first Buddha (Vipassi) and the last (Gotama) indicating the rest with <i>"pe".</i> Then Rhys Davids has Gotama visiting the <i>Atappa, Sudassa, Sudassi</i> and <i>Akinittha</i> heavens successively where in each case the gods deliver speeches similar to the ones delivered in the <i>Aviha</i> realm. But my reading of the <i>Pāḷi</i> is that the gods of each of the higher realms approach Gotama and join the others in the <i>Aviha</i> realm. I read for the last case, for example: "Then the <i>Akanittha</i> gods approach the <i>Aviha</i> gods and the <i>Attapa</i> gods and the <i>Sudassa</i> gods and the <i>Sudassi</i> gods and ... ." Rhys Davids has this as: "Then on, including thus the <i>Aviha</i> and Cool and Fair gods" In the translation proper I have expanded the abridgment of Rhys Davids translation according to his understanding, but I have footnoted the alternate reading in full using his terminology. The significance of the difference is pedagogical: It makes much better sense that each succeeding higher set of gods state their knowledge in front of the younger group.</p>

					<p class="f4">This passage which I have adapted from Rhys David's translation of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm">DN 14</a> where it is related of Vipassi Buddha's awakening is also found in the second part of <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p12">The First Sutta.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">In the conclusion to both versions, after having pieced together the sequence of dependencies resulting in birth and its consequent pain, the Buddhas remark: <i>"Samudayo! Samudayo!"</i> and a previously unrealized insight occurs to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since what has just occurred is the sequence of dependencies itself (the  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> ) (and thus it, itself, is not the insight that is being referred to as it <i>has</i> been previously realized) what <i>is</i> this insight that they are referring to?</p>

					<p class="f4">First one must grasp the significance of the originating idea, that is:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Paccudāvattati kho idaṃ viññāṇaṃ,||<br />
					nāma-rūpamhā,||<br />
					nā paraṃ gacchati.</i>|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">This consciousness rebounds off/evolves into named-form<br />
					going no further.</p>

					<p class="f4">... that for conscousness of existence as an individuality, consciousness and named-forms are interdependent. Picking an arbitrary starting point, consciousness of named forms results in a sequence that when mixed with identification with intent to create experience of existence leads to the formation of consciousness of named forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <i>'Samudaya'</i> is usually translated 'arising' or 'coming to be'. But here, as in <i>'Sankhārā'</i> we have an un-accounted-for (in such translations) <i>'sam.'</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Is this 'own'? or 'co-, con-, or com'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Looking at the point in the sequence named <i>'upādāna',</i> we can see that without fueling the fire the process would come to a halt at this point. When an identified-with previously rolling process (aka a living being) identfies with the intent to create experience of existence through acts of thought, word and deed, the process rolls on. The error is in thinking that this previously identified with instigator of action is 'the self' or 'a self' or 'belongs to a self'. In that it does not, the process is 'self-' or 'own-rising.' The parts replicate themselves. In that identification with intent to create experience of existence is necessary for the process to continue, it is 'co-arising'. Not 'co' 'you and it' but 'co' 'it and this intent and this identification and this action'. It can be let go without loss of 'self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Today [Tuesday, March 17, 2015 4:13 AM] we have these nano-robots that replicate themselves. But for that process to work automatically there was originally built into it the instruction to do that. That is the equivalent of the process of own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">In light of the above, the second half of this insight, <i>'Nirodha! Nirodha!'</i> is not just the seeing of the reverse of the process of the  <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> , but the fact that it is done by the ending of the identification of self with the fueling of the process. That it comes to an end of its own without that input.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as we can observe the self-replicatiing nano robot and see that we could dismantle the thing and prevent its self-replication by removing the instruction to replicate, we can remove the self-replicating intent to experience from this process of existing we call life and eliminate the consequent self-identification with its painful outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">How?</p>

					<p class="f4">By minute examination of everything occuring at the senses (or within the scope of the 4 <i>satipatthanas,</i> or within the scope of the <i>khandhas</i>).</p>

					<p class="f4">By '<i>yoniso-manasikara</i>-ing', tracing things back to their points of origin, one can observe the self-replicating process as occuring independent of any 'self,' dependent only on the mistaken view that there is self there (that 'I' will 'die' if I do not act).</p>

					<p class="f4">By eliminating every activity that is identified with self by filtering every thought, word, and deed through the <i>Magga,</i> The Aristocratic Multi-dimensional High Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one can see that one can opt-out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Opting out one is free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Recognizing this freedom as the freedom from pain that one has been seeking, one is free<br />
					and one knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is left behind,<br />
					lived was carrying on like Brahma,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more for me is there being it and at."</p>

							<p class="in2">'Becoming' is a literal translation of <i>'bhava'</i> (it could be 'bad-go' or 'pass-vent' or 'pass wind') which is elsewhere translated as 'being' or 'existing' or 'living'. It is what we understand as existing (and there is no 'existing' as we understand it outside of this), which is a process of becoming in the shape of forms of existence such as being human, being a god, etc. It is valuable for insight into the fact that this is a thing which is a self-sustaining <i>process,</i> that the idea of existing or living be seen as becoming.</p>

							<p class="in2">'Setting up' is what I now suggest is the best translation for <i>'upadana'</i> (literally: up-given), elsewhere translated Rhys Davids: 'grasping,' Walshe, Bhk. Bodhi: 'clinging,' Bhk. Thanissaro: 'clinging/sustenance,' and myself: 'upholding,' 'support,' 'upkeep,' 'going-after-getting', and more lately following Bhk. Thanissaro 'fueling'. The idea is that after the experience of sensations, and upon the arising of thirst one sets out to get, prepares the way, sets rolling the necessary pre-condtions for attaining, thereby fueling the fire of lust and furthering the effort to get. Setting up is accomplished by wanting/wishing, points of view, performing rites and rituals in the effort to attain experience of self. It is the actions of <i>sankhārā-ing</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-experience now being we have thirst,<br />
					sense-experience results in thirst.</p>

							<p class="in2">'Sense-experience,' (literally the 'thrill given'), takes, at its most fundamental, three forms: pleasant sensation, painful sensation or sensation that is not painful but not pleasant. Such sensations result from contact with an object perceived to be of a nature  corresponding to the sensation, but one experiences unpleasant sensation <i>then</i> perceives what one believes to be an unpleasant object. Sensation is relative to the object only in its results in the next revolution of the cycle and the mind, seeking the object of sensation can be mistaken and instigate on entirely false premises completely disasterous activity. Sensation <i>follows</i> contact. What one experiences as sensation <i>preceeds</i> thirst. 'Preceeds' means it comes before. 'Comes before' means it is already in the past. It is the experience of something that has already happened. Thirst set up on sense experience is chasing the past and results in becoming in the future. The process can be stopped at this point by tracing sense experience back to its point of origin <i>(yoniso-manasikaro)</i> and seeing that if it is not acted upon it will not result in future sense experience. Experiencing the unpleasant sensation called anger that results from a perception of some injury inflicted on one by some person or event one has the choice of reacting with vengeful, angry, and always mistaken behaviors (setting up further expectations of becoming in an unpleasant situation) or by perceiving the event as over-with, passed, done gone, at that point, letting the sensation die out.</p>

							<p class="in2">'The six-realms' is the literal translation of <i>'saḷāyatana'</i> which is shorthand for 'the six-realms of the senses': the eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, the mind and all things.</p>

							<p class="in2">'Named-forms' is the literal translation of <i>'nāma-rūpa',</i> elsewhere translated: Walshe and Rhys Davids (incorrectly imposing Western philosophical views on the <i>Pāḷi</i>) 'mind-and-body;' Bhk. Bodhi: mentality/materiality (just rephrasing the mistake of 'mind-and-body'); Rhys Davids, Hare, Horner, Bhk. Thanissaro: 'name and form;' Horner: psycho-physicality; Bhk. Punnaji: Entity/Identity (which is excellent if one does not wish to literally follow the <i>Pāḷi</i>); Woodward: Name and visible body complex. It could also, following the Greek, be translated: 'phenomena' <i>phe-nomena:</i> face-name, which is helpful for understanding the meaning. What is it that makes up an experience of sense? The Eye comes into Contact with a visible object. Sense-experience (senstion), and Consciousness of that sense experience are the result. The component parts are the Form (a shape, sound, scent, savour, touch, or mental object) and perception (identification of the object as a shape, sound, scent, savour, touch, or mental object that is pleasant, unpleasant or not unpleasant but not pleasant and as whatever further identifications that object has come to be known by).</p>

					sense-consciousness results in named-forms.</p>

							<p class="in2"><i>Viññāṇa,</i> literally 're-knowing-knowning-knowledge', the awareness of knowing that knowing is occuring. I believe this word also reflects the reality that consciousness as it is experienced by the ordinary individual is not a single act of knowing, but an illusion created by thousands of re-perceptions of a composite of previously perceived sense-objects. In the <i>Paṭica Samuppada Viññāṇa,</i> is intimately bound up in the point of view that this consciousness is arising in an individuality known as 'me,' perceiving through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">This sense-consciousness rebounds off/evolves into named-form<br />
					going no further.</p>

							<p class="in2"><i>Paccudāvattati</i> could also be 'rolls out from/returns to'. The simile given is of two shiefs of wheat which are able to be placed upright only by one leaning on the other. Consciousness needs an object to be conscious of to be consciousness as we know it; named-forms are only such when there is consciousness of them. Part of the idea of 'name' implies a perception of that name. Things have 'names' to their observer. They do not wander around space with a name attached waiting to be made conscious of. They are given names in the process of perception that results in consciouosness of them by an individual. Be careful to note that <i>'this!'</i> Our term 'consciousness' is not a direct equivalent of the <i>Pāḷi</i> <i>Viññāṇa,</i> and there is no end of trouble for one conceiving the idea that the Buddha is teaching the eradication of 'consciousness'.

					Sariputta explains the path to attaining of consummate view in thirty two (33 ?) different ways.<br />
					A very enlightening sutta!<br />
					Note that Ms. Horner has dared to break with the pack in her translation of <i>'sammā'</i> as 'perfect'.<br />
					Note that here is an exposition of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> which casts each of the factors in the form of the Four Truths which shows both that each of the factors is itself a path to <i>Nibbāna,</i> and that the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> as a whole is a way of stating the Four Truths.<br />
					Note that the commentator numbers the proclamation of the Four Truths in this sutta as 32. I suggest that in addition the entire sutta also counts as one such proclamation, so the number should be 33.<br />
					Note that we have here the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> with the <i>'āsavas'</i> the corrupting influences, (Ms. Horner's 'cankers'), preceding the usual 'ignorance' as its starting point.<br />
					Note that here 'Craving' <i>'Taṇha'</i> is at one point said to be the precurser to the sustenances, and later in the secquence paralleling the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> it is said to be the origin of <i>'upādāna'</i> (Ms. Horner's 'Grasping'.) I suggest this is a good argument for the translation of <i>'upādāna'</i> not as 'grasping,' but as 'support' or 'fuel' or an equivalant term. See above: 'set-ups'.<br />
					Note that under the three <i>sankhar</i>ings which I have usually described as of thought, word, and deed, the precise translation would be of body, word, and heart (where 'heart' is 'citta', or that work of the heart which has to do with intent and will, and is more specifically associated with individuality than is the more general <i>'mano'</i> or 'mind'). The Buddha's system of <i>'kamma'</i> makes a distinction between a passing thought and thought associated with intent or will. Passing thoughts are not '<i>kammic</i> acts' or <i>saṅkhāras</i> (own-makings).<br />

					Note: This sutta shows that minding the body is a complete path to <i>Nibbāna.</i> Ms. Horner would have it that this sutta has been extracted from the <i>Satipaṭṭhana.</i> It seems just as reasonable (more reasonable if one considers the disjointed feel of the composition of the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i>) to think that the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> Sutta was compiled using this sutta.<br />

					The Buddha teaches how the intent to create experience for the self results in rebirth in accordance with the intent in a sequence that progresses from the intent to experience rebirth as a wealthy or powerful individual through a detailed list of gods to Arahantship.<br />
					This sutta needs to be fully unabridged for its full power to be manifest. It is not simply a set of formulas for attaining this or that rebirth, but as a sequence, it also points out at each succeeding step a greater and more ambitious goal.<br />

					I cannot recommend this book as it is really a translation of a commentary on a commentary on Buddhaghosa's editing of the original commentaries which is to say that it affirms and elaborates on and stands a high probability of adding to the errors of the originals — a far cry from the intent of this site to direct the attention of the reader to the original documentation — and because, although on first appearances it would seem that a book devoted specifically to the lay follower would be useful, that would be better accomplished with an anthology of suttas from the <i>Sutta Pitaka.</i> As it stands a random opening of the book showed a dangerous commentarial misinterpretation of <i>kamma.</i> The Buddha's exposition of <i>kamma</i> is relatively straightforward: the repercussion of an act returns to the doer thereof in accordance with the intent with which the original act was undertaken. He discusses the factors going into magnitude. He speaks of generic black and white <i>kamma, kamma</i> of mixed results and <i>kamma</i> that carries no result. He speaks of <i>kamma</i> with immediate results and <i>kamma</i> with delayed results. He states that for anyone other than himself, going into details concerning the specific outcomes of specific deeds whether past, future, or present, is dangerous. Where such details are presented or discussed other than by Gotama, (there is no such discussion in the Suttas) they are commentary and should be put to the side. Here the statement is made that if a person, without knowing who his father was, killed his father thinking he was an animal or an unrelated person, he would nevertheless suffer the immediate and lengthy retribution of a patricide. No. The intent is not there. He would suffer the consequences of an ordinary deed of killing. My commentary accords with what we are given in the suttas, what appears in this book is pure, out of thin air speculation without any basis for the argument given. I personally do not have time to delve deeply into a work that at first glance shows such an error and I recommend the reader also put this work to the side awaiting such a point in one's understanding of the suttas where time can be spent wasted on reviewing wrong views.<br />

						<p>It is almost impossible to imagine the wealth of Wheel-turning Kings and some of the wealthy kings described in the suttas, and even Gotama's description of the luxory of his life before he renounced the world is extreme beyond what we could imagine of the luxory of even a Bill Gates, or Carlos Slim, and Rhys Davids at one point suggests that the descriptions are wild fantasies, but read below a authentic description, (only one of many similar such of rulers of both East and West) by a contemporary (c.900 AD) of the wealth of a Mohamadan Caliph ... and what he thought of it himself:</p>

						<p class="f4">"... the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence and frugality of the first caliphs, and aspired to emulate the magnificence of the Persian kings. After his wars and buildings, Almansor left behind him in gold and silver about thirty millions sterling;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="wnfn1" href="#wnn1">1</a>]</sup></span> and this treasure was exhausted in a few years by the vices or virtues of his children. His son Mahadi, in a single pilgrimage to Mecca, expended six millions of dinars of gold. A pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of cisterns and caravanseras, which he distributed along a measured road of seven hundred miles; but his train of camels, laden with snow,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="wnfn2" href="#wnn2">2</a>]</sup></span> could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia, and to refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet. The courtiers would surely praise the liberality of his grandson Almamon, who gave away four fifths of the income of a province, a sum of two millions four hundred thousand gold dinars, before he drew his foot from the stirrup. At the nuptials of the same prince, a thousand pearls of the largest size were showered on the head of the bride, and a lottery of lands and houses displayed the capricious bounty of fortune. The glories of the court were brightened rather than impaired in the decline of the empire; and a Greek ambassador might admire or pity the magnificence of the feeble Moctader. "The caliph's whole army," says the historian Abulfeda, "both horse and foot, was under arms, which together made a body of one hundred and sixty thousand men. His state-officers, the favourite slaves, stood near him in splendid apparel, their belts glittering with gold and gems. Near them were seven thousand eunuchs, four thousand of them white, the remainder black. The porters or door-keepers were in number seven hundred. Barges and boats, with the most superb decorations, were seen swimming upon the Tigris. Nor was the palace itself less splendid, in which were hung up thirty-eight thousand pieces of tapestry, twelve thousand five hundred of which were of silk embroidered with gold. The carpets on the floor were twenty-two thousand. An hundred lions were brought out with a keeper to each lion. Among the other spectacles of rare and stupendous luxury, was a tree of gold and silver spreading into eighteen large branches, on which, and on the lesser boughs, sat a variety of birds made of the same precious metals, as well as the leaves of the tree. While the machinery affected spontaneous motions, the several birds warbled their natural harmony. Through this scene of magnificence, the Greek ambassador was led by the visir to the foot of the caliph's throne." In the West, the Ommiades of Spain supported, with equal pomp, the title of commander of the faithful. Three miles from Cordova, in honour of his favourite sultana, the third and greatest of the Abdalrahmans constructed the city, palace, and gardens of Zehra. Twenty-five years, and above three millions sterling, were employed by the founder: his liberal taste invited the artists of Constantinople, the most skilful sculptors and architects of the age; and the buildings were sustained or adorned by twelve hundred columns of Spanish and African, of Greek and Italian marble. The hall of audience was encrusted with gold and pearls, and a great bason in the centre, was surrounded with the curious and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds. In a lofty pavilion of the gardens, one of these basons and fountains, so delightful in a sultry climate, was replenished not with water, but with the purest quicksilver. The seraglio of Abdalrahman, his wives, concubines, and black eunuchs, amounted to six thousand three hundred persons; and he was attended to the field by a guard of twelve thousand horse, whose belts and scymetars were studded with gold.</p>

						<p class="f4">In a private condition, our desires are perpetually repressed by poverty and subordination; but the lives and labours of millions are devoted to the service of a despotic prince, whose laws are blindly obeyed, and whose wishes are instantly gratified. Our imagination is dazzled by the splendid picture; and whatever may be the cool dictates of reason, there are few among us who would obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts and the cares of royalty. It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps excited our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. "I have now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they amount to F<span class="f2">OURTEEN</span>: - 0 man! place not thy confidence in this present world."</p>

					The story of Ratthapala who, inspired by a <i>Dhamma</i>-talk given by the Buddha wishes to enter the order but is refused the permission of his parents. (Up to 200 years or so ago even in Europe it was common that 'children' (males and females) up to the age of 25 and older were required by law to ask permission of their parents for such things as marriage. They could be put in jail for disobediance.) He vows to die on the spot unless he receives permission and after many pleadings by his parents and friends finally gets his parents concent. He thereafter quickly becomes arahant. On revisiting his family he is first unrecognized and subjected to abuse, then his father tries to tempt him to return to the world with gold and his former wives. He is not persuaded and delivers a sermon in verses on the subject of the pains in the world. Still later he discourses to the king on four doctrines of the Buddha concerning the futility of living in the world.<br />
					An inspiring story of faith. Fully rolled out it paints an interesting picture of dialogue and manners of the time.</p>

					Highly recommended as inspiration for women and for information for feminists. The thing to note is where in many cases there is acceptance without complaint of what is understood by these women to be disagreeable positions in life and their transcendence of these situations through entering the order and personal achievement within the system ... as contrasted to the modern effort to change the situations. We are cast into roles, or destinies, in this life and unless the role calls for transgression of ethical bounds the best way to handle a role in terms of not creating new bad <i>kamma</i> and ending old <i>kamma</i> is to play the role well. Playing the role well is the highest form of disparagement of the idea that there is anything of substance in the world, and renouncing the world is the ultimate statement as to the hopelessness of any idea that it is a salvagable thing. Individuals are salvagable, the world goes round and round. Read your history.</p>

This is not one of the orthodox <i>kasinas.</i> The way it works is that Cūḷa-Panthaka handles the cloth as he meditates and as he does so the cloth becomes soiled and by that he perceives the inconstance and corruption of existence.

					The Buddha describes having vision in terms of knowing about form, sense-experience, perception, own-making or sense-consciousness, knowing about their arising, knowing about their ending, and knowing about the walk to walk to bring about their ending.<br />
					Woodward translates <i>'avijjā'</i> and <i>'vijjā'</i> as 'ignorance' and 'wisdom'; Bhk. Bodhi translates them 'ignorance' and 'true knowledge'. 'Ignorance' has pretty much established itself in the general consciousness but it is not quite accurate. The word means 'not-vision' and its opposite should be the opposite of whatever word is used for that (or the other way around). Wisdom is having vision <i>plus</i> having knowledge of the ways that vision is best used in a broad scope of applications. The better translation is closer to Bhk. Bodhi's but there is no 'true' there. It is really 'vision', 'seeing'. It is not ignorance of the four truths, it is not seeing, or understanding them. Additionally 'wisdom' has been and is better used for <i>'paññā'</i> (pan knowing).<br />

					There appears to me to be some confusion between this and the previous sutta. In the first the only question asked is what makes a <i>Dhamma</i> teacher but three questions are answered. In the second three questions are asked which correspond to the answers given in both suttas. Further complicating the issue Woodward makes the second question in the second sutta ask about teaching about living the <i>Dhamma</i> following the <i>Dhamma,</i> which is not being asked and does not correspond to the answer. It seems the first sutta should have asked only the first question and been given only the first answer, and the second sutta which asks all three questions should follow (without Woodward's interjection of 'is one a teacher of').<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.136.wood.pts.htm">Glowing Embers</a> the F.W. Woodward translation,<br />
					The Buddha describes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness as glowing embers.<br />
					The controversy mentioned in this sutta is a tempest in a teapot which eminates from one side ridgidly holding the position that everything is painful, not acknowledging transitory pleasures as being nevertheless pleasures; while the other side refuses to see that seen from the point of view of the ultimate result this is a legitimate position. Pleasure in this world is an observable fact, it is also observable that it always ends in pain. Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of <i>'sankhārā'</i> as 'conditioned' rather than 'own-made' or, at least 'constructed' in <i>Pts. of Contr.</i> only serves to confuse the issue.<br />
					What is going on here is important to note. It is essentially the same problem as trying to understand the notion of 'not-self' versus 'no self'. The difference between the statement (or interpretation of a statement made by another) of an observable fact and the statement of an opinion. Either of the two statements, 'the all (the world, the <i>khandhas,</i> etc.) is painful' or 'there is pleasure in the all ...' are true as far as they go. It is when the idea jumps to the categorical "everything, all (not 'the all') is ..." that the statement has become opinion. And, since an opinion concerning 'all' would require of the opinion holder the knowledge of all things at all times which is not possible, such opinion crosses over into error.<br />

					The Buddha describes living the <i>Dhamma</i> of the <i>Dhamma</i> as living seeing pain in form, sense-experience, perception own-making and sense-consciousness. So living he understands, understanding he is liberated.<br />
					This sutta does not appear in PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> or in Woodward's translation. This is very probably an error. It does occur in the BJT <i>Pāḷi</i> (although with an error that looks like it was an after-thought) and in the CSCD <i>Pāḷi</i> used by the Bhk. Bodhi Wisdom Publications ed. and it belongs here by the logic of the usual construction of this series. Both have been constructed here following the pattern of the previous sutta. To avoid renumbering or having duplicate sutta numbers 'a' has been appended to the previous sutta number for this sutta.<br />

					Note: Sutta numbers for the Wisdom Publication edition and the BJT and CSCD <i>Pāḷi</i> from this point to the end of this chapter are off by 1.<br />
					The PTS naming of §s 146-148 seem to me to need rethinking. Bhk. Bodhi has: 'Engrossed in Revulsion', Contemplating Impermanence ... Suffering ... Nonself' which is more logical. To retain the PTS 'by the clansman' (and all of these suttas from 137 on should really be 'by way of ...') they should be: 'By the clansman: aversion; ... impermanence ... suffering ... no soul.'<br />

					Once again we have this very curious saying. Woodward doubts his own translation. I suggest the doubt that arises is a consequence of the possibility of this saying being heard in the original in multiple meanings according to context. "If I had not held such a thing to be mine in the past, it would not be mine now, if I do not hold such a thing to be mine in the present it will not become mine in the future." Substitute 'this pleasurable thing' for 'such a thing'; then substitute 'this painful thing' for 'such a thing' and reflect on the change in attitude that results.<br />

					My usual warning that <i>'micchā'</i> should not be being translated 'wrong'. It is not 'wrong' it is 'mis'-something; mis-taken, mis-guided, mis-ccha ... . In the same way <i>'sammā'</i> should not be being translated 'right' although in that case there is etymological justification. The idea is not of right and wrong as we understand it, it is of 'the best way' versus all other ways. You say 'right' and that makes all other ways 'wrong' and you have set yourself in opposition to the world. The object is not to be in opposition to the world. It is to not be in opposition to or in favor of anything in the world. <i>'Sammā diṭṭhi'</i> is the 'consummate', 'correct', 'upright' course for those who'se aim is to escape pain.<br />

					The Buddha teaches that because of form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness the view that there is only one correct way of seeing things with regard to body arises and that the escape therefrom is through seeing the inconstance, pain, and non-self in these things.<br />
					The word to understand is <i>'sakkāya.' sa</i>= one, own; <i>kāya</i> = 'k-kha-whatever', body as in 'the human body' and as in 'a body of water'. Woodward: 'person-pack'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'personality' (in this sutta 'identity;); Rhys Davids: 'delusion of self'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'self-identity'; Horner: 'own-body'. The two closest are Horner's 'own-body' and Woodward's person-pack (taking <i>sa</i> as 'own &gt; person' and <i>kāya</i> as 'pack'). The <i>'sakkāya-diṭṭhi'</i> or view that there is a <i>'sakkāya'</i> is a <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm">saṇyojana</a> and is broken when one attains Stream-winning. I personally believe that 'body' here refers to a greater range of things than 'one's own body', and that the term should be understood as 'one-body' (i.e., of truth, set of ideas) that it includes holding any belief that there is but one way of seeing things and that that is the only true way and all other beliefs are foolish  — a statement frequently repeated in the suttas as the principle error in holding views and which would encompass the idea that there was such a thing as 'one's own body'. In the meta-data description above I have tried to construct a reasonable compromise in the way this is stated and the more usual translations.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi notes that <i>'Spk states that the identification of each aggregate individually with the self is the annihilationist view ... </i> [the annihiliationist view is that whatever is identified with as the self comes to be utterly extinguished upon the ending of the thing identified-with]<i> while the other views are variants of eternalism ... thus there are five types of annihilationism</i> [of the five <i>khandhas:</i> "the self is ~"]<i> and fifteen of eternalism</i> [of the five <i>khandhas:</i> 'the self has'; '~ is in the self'; 'the self is in ~'].<i> To my mind this is unacceptable, for eternalist views can clearly be formulated by taking the individual mental aggregates as the self. <i>[this would still be taking the (or a) <i>khandha</i> as the self as the mental 'aggregates' are derived therefrom]</i> It also seems to me questionable that a view of self must implicitly posit one (or more) of the aggregates as self; for a view of self to have any meaning or content, it need only posit a relationship between a supposed self and the aggregates, but it need not identify one of the aggregates as self.'</i> This does not recognize the all encompasing nature of the idea of the <i>khandhas,</i> and proposes a 'self' outside of the <i>khandhas</i> that 'has a relationship' with one or more of the <i>khandhas.</i> This is a view of an eternal self. The Buddhas proposition is that there is no self outside of the <i>khandhas.</i> But the point is that 'self' is not raised at all in the term <i>'sakkāya.'</i> And <i>'kāya'</i> in this sutta refers to the other <i>khandhas</i> besides the body. Further, in the next sutta 'self-view' does raise the self as the issue. Why the distinction here if there is no underlying difference?<br />

					<i>"There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing presented in charity; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously; no ascetics and Brahmins faring and practising rightly in the world who, having realized this world and the other world for themselves by direct knowledge, make them known to others.

					The view of <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/purana-kassapa.htm">Pūraṇa Kassapa,</a> on the ineffectiveness of action in the production of consequences.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi's translation of this view:<br />
					<i>"When one acts or makes others act, when one mutilates or makes others mutilate, when one tortures or makes others inflict torture, when one inflicts sorrow or makes others inflict sorrow, when one oppresses or makes others inflict oppression, when one intimidates or makes others inflict intimidation, when one destroys life, takes what is not given, breks into houses, plunders wealth, commits burglary, ambushes highways, seduces another's wife, utters falsehood  — no evil is done by the doer. If, with a razor-rimmed wheel, one were to make the living beings of this earth into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh, because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing and slaughtering, mutilating and making others mutilate, torturning and making others inflict torture, because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making others give gifts, making offerings and making others make offerings, because of this there would be no merit and no outcome of merit. By giving, by taming oneself, by self-control, by speaking truth, there is no merit and no outcome of merit."</i><br />
					These views are not the products of simple-minded fools. They are arrived at at a point in deep meditative trances where the atomic nature of things is seen and the conclusion is reached that there is no individuality or even reality to anything and that the world is in fact a static illusion.<br />

					Note: Woodward here translates <i>'diṭṭhi'</i> as heresy. This is not a correct translation, but is an interpretation put on the word when used of certain views. From the Buddhist perspective all views are essentially incorrect. <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (right view, or, better, consummate or high view) is 'high' or 'consummate' only in so far as it serves the goal. Similarly to the issue discussed in <a href="#sn3.22.136">SN 3.22.136 above,</a> one must understand <i>'sammā diṭṭhi'</i> as a view from the perspective of its goal or it becomes at least partially incorrect.<br />
					Again perceptions giving rise to views of the sort found in the last three suttas can be encountered by any meditator. The world is seen as arising images, then vibrating atoms and then even the vibration stops as well and it is very easy to conclude that there is no existing as a living being and that therefore there is no doing evil or good deeds as it is just illusions passing through illusions. It is for this reason that a thorough understanding that <i>kamma</i> is action based on intent is so important. Real or not, intentional acts produce subjectively experienced results, and that is as good as saying that the consensus reality must be respected and dealt with as it is subjectively experienced by the ordinary common man and that being the case the view that 'it exists' cannot be rationally denied even when it cannot be rationally aserted.<br />

					The first if he does not forsake his faith will realize full streamwinning at death if not before; the second will also realize full streamwinning at death if not before. The fruit of streamwinning is the knowledge that one has become an Aristocrat among men <i>(Ariyan),</i> one is no longer a <i>'puthujjana'</i> (commoner) (a word too often applied by <i>bhikkhus</i> without discrimination to all who are not ordained <i>bhikkhus</i>); and one is no longer capable of doing such a deed as would land one in Hell, in an animal birth, or as a daemon or ghost. Note that here it is not stated that there remains but seven further rebirths only.<br />
					A sutta that should give hope and inspiration to the many thousands of people out there who have not taken the step of entering the <i>Saṅgha</i> but who nevertheless appreciate the wisdom found in the <i>Dhamma.</i><br />
					This should guide us to avoid sceptacism concerning claims made to Streamwinning made by those who may seem to be ... somewhat off the highest course. On the other hand, the claims of those aserting Arahantship should be given the most minute examination, comparing their behavior in thought, word and deed to the highest standards. The person claiming Arahantship is also saying that it is wise to follow his example, and such a one, when his view of his accomplishments are a consequence of 'the great blindness element' is dangerous to himself and others. One should assure one's self of the truth or falsity of such a claim in such a case in the most objective manner possible. One would definitely prosper upon finding a genuine Arahant while it might be possible to dissuade someone of an incorrect and dangerous view of themselves by educating them to the criteria for such found in the Suttas. (But, just for the record, it is not likely that any genuine Arahant would be heard by a layman to claim to be such. This would be itself a violation of a serious <i>Vinaya</i> rule and in the formal (worldly) <i>Saṅgha</i> or outside, an Arahant would be one who naturally followed the rules as they have their basis either <i>kamma</i> or the good of both individuals and the world.) The claims of those aserting Non-Returner status should also be examined carefully, but there is more latitude there (and consequently more room to make an incorrect judgment) and it is advisable (so says Gotama! [<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.044.hare.pts.htm">Migasālā,</a> and <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p75">AN 10 75</a>]: where some woman questions Gotama's declaration of two cases of non-returning where one had returned to the use of alcohol but who had unshakable faith and insight while another had exemplary behavior but somewhat less insight) not to make a judgment in such a case. There are many factors involved in the case of the Non-returner and some may be present and some absent in ways that determine the outcome in ways difficult to predict.<br />

The confusion may arise by the association with the fourth of the <i>Satipaṭṭhanas</i> where 'Living observing <i>dhammas</i> through The <i>Dhamma</i>' is described as observing the arising and passing away of several elements of The <i>Dhamma.</i> There is a general tendency among the translators to translate the Four <i>Satipaṭṭhanas</i> as though all four were aspects of the physical being (so the attempt to force <i>'dhammesu dhammānupassī'</i> into being the observation of all things mental and by that causing a conflict with the previous, <i>(citta)</i>) where what is being described is <i>'Dhammesu dhammānupassī'</i> 'observing things through The <i>Dhamma</i>' making the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> a progression of observation from the body to sense experience to mental states to the abstract realm of The <i>Dhamma.</i> The object of the quest is to become like the Buddha: "<i>Dhamma</i> become." This is not a state downbound to the body or any form of the experience of existence through the senses including the mind as a sense.<br />

					Woodward references a point of controversy which appears to be an argument arising from an understanding that <i>'~sañcetanā'</i> implies an intrensic moral value within or attached to (<i>(sañ)</i>) sights, etc. The counter-argument points to <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.171.wood.pts.htm">AN 4.171.</a> where it is explained that <i>kamma</i> (good or bad action) <i>is</i> essentially defined by <i>'sañcetanā'</i> ('intent with regard to' or even possibly 'own-intent' 'identified-with intent'.) Woodward attempts to clarify the matter with his 'acts occasioned by'. Intent is an act <i>(kamma)</i> but this goes too far from the <i>Pāḷi.</i> The literal translation of <i>cetana</i> would be something like 'having the heart for' and this sutta does not go further than that into such things as acts of body related to sights etc. Again in this sutta Woodward speaks of 'body' where he should be speaking of 'sights' and in this sutta he has again switched his translation of <i>dhamma,</i> this time to 'ideas.' (I am not making a judgment here, I am in no position to do so being guilty of the same fault, I am just pointing out the fact to bring it to consciousness. Woodward, as even translators today, have the choice to change their translations as they go along knowing how raggidy it looks, or not publishing at all which would be of benefit to no one ... maybe, depends on if the translation is really misleading. The alternative, to go back and alter all previous occurrances of a term, would stiffle completion of even one book. Further, it is a wonderful phenomena with regard to this <i>Dhamma</i> that if the intent is to provide a true translation the word will likely be of benefit even when it is not quite the precise term that would yield the most insight or magic. This results in a picture of the evolution of understanding of the translator which may actually serve to benefit the serious reader who is likely to go through the same evolution himself even when faced with the most precisely true translation possible. In any case the work is so vast as to make inconsistancies unavoidable until the time when the whole work can be subjected to some kind of analysis that catches all the instances of a term throughout and substitutes the best translation, one that works in all cases. Work for the next generation of translators.)<br />

					Here Woodward has come around to the understanding that what is required for the object of the eye-sense is signts in general, not just body. He translates 'material forms'. It has taken him three go-rounds to come to consciousness of this relationship. I remember when I first began reading the suttas I was astounded: This guy (The Buddha) is trying to teach us about the senses! I learned about the senses in the third grade. (Minus, of course, the idea that the mind was also a sense-organ. ... a little omission.) But the fact of the matter is that we are so accustomed to living in the senses that we do not actually have a clear view of their workings, that it is a struggle to connect in our conscious thinking the objects of sense with the sense organs. And it is essential for the task of attaining freedom from existence that the six senses and their objects be understood for a comprehension of the relationship of the illusion of self to this world. As an aside, I argue that in the same way, the language used for translating the <i>Pāḷi</i> must be as fundamental (literal) as possible for the same reason: It is only when the foundation is firmly established that one can be sure that the abstract is not a distortion. I am completely convinced that Gotama's choice of words was selected precisely for this reason and that that choice should be respected, must be respected to convey his ideas clearly.<br />

					I object to the translation of <i>'Upekkhā'</i> as Equanimity used by Woodward and nearly every other translator. This is a term which must fit not only in the description of the Fourth <i>Jhāna,</i> where because the Fourth <i>Jhāna,</i> is still 'in this world' equanimity would be a possible fit, but it must also work where it is <i>not</i> of the world. Equanimity is a term which describes a state of balance <i>'in the world'</i> and for that reason will not do. The term that will serve both situations is 'detachment'. And that is what the word is telling you it means: 'Up pass k-kha'. Look it up. 'Up passed' is not 'balanced between' the two sides (pleasant and painful) of experience, it is the experience of neither of the two sides. For those who wish to develop <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#NIRUTTI"><i>'nirutti',</i></a> ask then why is <i>upa</i> spelled <i>upe? pek.</i> up pass pekkha kkha. Up passed wishing and wanting stuff. Grip the index finger of your right hand with the fingers of your left hand and then pull your index finger out of the grip. Don't get discourged if you can't do it. Keep your pecker up! (Be of good cheer!) Pecker = an instrument, like a pick or a beak, used to peck away at what one wishes to have. <i>Upekkha</i> = Detachment.<br />

					I suggest this 'realm' is mistranslated 'nothingness'. <i>'Ākiñcaññā'</i> should be understood as a term describing lack of possession. Its not that there is nothing there, it is that there is nothing there which can be or which is possessed, owned, had. To say 'There is nothing' is to hold a wrong view. PED definitely brings out the idea of ownership: "From the frequent context in the older texts it has assumed the moral implication of something that sticks or adheres to the character of a man, and which he must get rid of, if he wants to attain to a higher moral condition." In entering these states one is not inclined to great verbosity, so the statement made upon entering here <i>"n'atthi kiñcī"</i> 'There is not a smidgen', needs to be heard from the point of view of the meditator striving ever after more and more refined states, or in this case, states ever more free from 'things' to which one is attached.<br />

					<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.29.001.wood.pts.htm">According to Scheme,</a> the F.W. Woodward translation,<br />
					The Buddha describes the four ways <i>Nagas</i> are born in a scheme ranking them from lowest to highest in order of purity.<br />
					"According to Scheme," (Bhk. Bodhi's: Simple Version), <i>Pāḷi</i>: <i>Suddhika,</i> derives from <i>Suddhi</i> = pure. So the idea is, according to this understanding, the simple, pure description of the various ways <i>Nāgas</i> come to birth. But the different sorts of birth can also be seen as a hierarchy going from the most involved form of birth (from egg) to the least involved (spontaneous). Since this is precisely the point of the next sutta, the translation's of Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi do not seem justified. So far this describes the four sorts of birth of all beings, not just <i>Nāgas.</i><br />
					It is not clear what sort of class of beings is referred to here as <i>Nāga.</i> The term is used for large animals such as snakes and elephants and for their mythical equivalants, but also for very large beings of any species. The Buddha is frequently referred to as a <i>Naga.</i> I suspect the term here is meant to indicate a 'monstrosity' of any species. (Upon further reflection upon the suttas that follow this is probably not the case. It appears what is being referred to is the 'sea-monster' or dragon or large snake of 'myth' who live under the sea in great luxory with many concubines and have many supernormal powers.) Two forms of rebirth are not familiar here: 'sweat-born' and 'spontaneous'. Woodward quotes commentary that states that the 'sweat-born' are born through the pores. Bhk. Bodhi translates <i>'saṇsedajā'</i> as 'moisture-born'. Both definitions are in PED. Birth through the pores is recognized by science, but strictly speaking birth via moisture is not. Insects that appear to have been born via water have in fact been born via eggs. There is a certain sort of frog that gives birth through the pores. It is one of the most nausiating sights ever to be seen, but presumably in other species, was apparently considered of a higher sort than being born via an egg or womb. [EDIT: For a little more on the various sorts of birth and the <i>Pāḷi</i> terms for such see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.009.horn.pts.htm#n14">MN 9, Horner, ns 14-17;</a> where the commentator's or translator's understanding is birth from moisture.] The 'spontaneously-born' disappear from one place without undergoing death and re-appear in another place without undergoing birth. This is the form of rebirth of the non-returner, but it obviously applies to other sorts of beings as well. Imagine the case of the untamed, uneducated, untrained common meditator who conceives the wish to spy on someone as if a fly on the wall ... and, snap fingers, there he is. And fly-wit that he now is, it is no easy thing to return to human birth. Splat!</p>

					<span class="f3">or</span><br />
					Sympathy for the Devil</h4>

					<p class="f4">There is another way of seing this business of <i>Nagas</i> or other such low-level <i>devas</i> besides that of the knee-jerk dismissal as the product of primative imagination. Actually the idea applies not only to the lower <i>devas,</i> but to all the gods and for that matter all states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">The idea is neatly described in an episode found in Castaneda's Don Juan series. In this case Castaneda has been projected into another realm by Don Juan. When he emerges from the situation he describes it to Don Juan as appearing in another world, populated by human-like individuals in a very modern-sounding town, but who find him strange and dangerous. Carlos asks Don Juan if he was there with him in the situation and to describe what he saw. Don Juan replies that he was indeed there, but all he saw was energy fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">You see the idea? We know the world only through the intervention of our mind. Our mind takes the sensory input given to it by the senses and weaves a story around it fitting everything nicely into the world as we expect it to be. No monsters. No <i>Devas.</i> No gods. No magic. Pleanty of danger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Other ages, and other cultures even today, do not see the world in the same way. They see the energy fields that result in rain, move the clouds around, or emit thunder and lightning as human-like super-human beings. We call this way of seeing things 'primitive,' 'uneducated,' 'unscientific.' But all that can be said of that way of seeing things applies just as easily to our own. To live and communicate in a community all we require is that a convincing group of individuals agrees that it sees what the other individuals in that group sees.</p>

					<p class="f4">The other day I watched half a movie about a real-life story that happened in Australia. I got to see only half the movie because the disk was defective. It was the story of an extraordinarily detached psychopathic serial killer. A super-violent, bloody film I cannot recommend anyone ever watch. It was intensely gripping and horrifying. I couldn't get it out of my mind for days. That was especially the case because where the disk stopped working was at a point where a central individual who had been being chased around the out-back and with whom the viewer was intended to identify had been caught and had just awakened to find himself in this monster's dungeon strapped hands and feet to a chair with zip-ties, surrounded by impliments of torture. End of movie.</p>

					<p class="f4">My thinking went round and round about all the mistakes the victims had made, and what would I do in their place. Many wrong thoughts of means of violent self-defense occurred. But the fact was that this madman was apparently extremely strong and highly skilled in a variety of hand-to-hand martial arts and weapons, alert, intelligent and with his senses finely tuned, could survive in the desert and had an ability to track. Not many senarios played out to a happy ending. As a predator the guy simply out-classed most human beings. The best one could hope for was to wake up and find it was all just a dream.</p>

					<p class="f4">Finally of course it occurred to me what was probably the real-life solution used by the young man. Stockholm syndrome. Befriend the monster and run away as soon as some opportunity presented itself ... or maybe not. Maybe just stick around. The guy has plenty of survival skills to teach ... . If it were possible to befriend such a one, or be convincing enough to make him believe the effort. "Jeeze, you know, man, I'm just like you in a way. ... You must be very lonely out here all alone with no friends." Etc. But the problem with this solution is that though it might buy some time here, it would almost certainly require some complicity in one or more brutal acts and while a jury here might find such a one innocent, <i>kamma</i> doesn't work that way. Complicity is complicity. The best one could hope for would be to come to one's end just to wake up to find himself once again in some monster's dungeon strapped hands and feet to a chair with zip-ties surrounded by impliments of torture. Wrong answer. Do-over.</p>

					<p class="f4">Better, I concluded, was to just calm down, project loving kindness onto his energy field and accept whatever death came down the tracks with as much dignitiy as one could muster. Meanwhile try not to lie or try other deceptions or to act with violence if possible or hate if not possible to try for an extension which could result in one dying with a very bad mental attitude which could result in a worse situation than one was already in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, I say, is a perfect case of an energy field that it is not possible to consider to be human, in human form. A <i>yakka.</i> An <i>Asura.</i> An evil <i>Naga</i> or <i>Garuda.</i> Perhaps with a better sense of vision than that with which I am endowed, I might even be able to make distinctions. Certainly there are enough cases now of psychopath serial killers in today's consensus reality for this group to be classed as a non-human species that most people just see as having human form but which better resembles a grotesque monster, or at least pure malevolant energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turn it around. When those arrogant rational educated scientific-minded thinkers pronounce the impossibility of such things as monsters and gods, perhaps it is not the primitive nature of the believer that should be questioned, but the limited vision of the arrogant rational educated scientific-minded thinker.</p>

					<p class="f4">That <i>you</i> cannot see this as it really is is a combination of ignorance, conditioning and fear. The ignorance can be broken by contact with the <i>Dhamma:</i> That is, that this is not some real individual here, some 'I', some 'mine'; that identification with forces of nature comes to be from wanting to identify with them; that this is essentially a state bound down to pain; that this pain can be escaped by escaping that wanting; and that wanting can be escaped by avoiding any behavior that reflects wanting. Fear can be overcome by the acceptance of Death and the assurance that that Death will not be followed by a bad outcome that results from knowledge and faith in one's practice of the <i>Dhamma.</i> The conditioning is a tougher problem. The first thing to recognize is that if the desire to break through this conditioning and fear is genuine then of the first importance is securing a refuge in solitude apart from the constant re-enforcement the conditioning receives at the hands of society (i.e. movies, books, news but almost everything we see around us today in this modern world is a programming message). Following on that, careful examination of things will show the inconsistancies, weaknesses, feableness of that conditioning and other possible explanations for things. At a certain point behavior that cannot be called human should break down the perception of a being of such behavior as 'human'. When that perception is no longer acceptable, another perception will become possible or another way of perceiving will emerge.  Acceptance of the possibility that things are different than they have always appeared will eventually destroy the illusion. It just takes working at it. Some things will need to be given up. Movies for example. It doesn't come about by wishing or pretending or reading or experimenting within pre-defined limits to what it is that can be called reality. Your status as a pompous rational educated scientific-minded thinker will not get you one step closer to perception of things the way they are ... rather it will get you one step closer to being one of those non-human monsters that appear in human form here. How come? Because your world is made up entirely of your own imaginings; you do not really see things as they are; so they can and will get out of hand, that's how come.</p>

					The Buddha describes the four ways <i>Nagas</i> are born and describes a scheme ranking them from lowest to highest.<br />
					Woodward's abridgment (which I have corrected while unabridging using his words and style) messes up and duplicates the first rank in the last rank of the order. (I give his original rendering in a footnote.) Bhk. Bodhi has maintained the proper hierarchy and complete wording but does not follow the <i>Pāḷi</i> order from worst to best in his construction. Its a small thing, and what is usually found in the English, but the original <i>Pāḷi</i> is better for assisting the memory. I have done a translation which I believe both follows more closely the <i>Pāḷi</i> and makes the order clear: The worst is egg-birth, followed by womb-birth, sweat-birth and best, spontaneous birth. This order, which is the usual <i>Pāḷi</i> way of listing hierarchies, is maintained by the suttas that follow this one.<br />

					<p class="f4">A series of questions and answers between Gotama and Vacchagotta the Wanderer concerning the origin of various views concerning existence.<br />
					The natural thought here is that all these suttas were originally only one sutta. The more interesting view is that here The Buddha was dealing with an outsider and that by breaking up a question that could have been given one answer into 55 individual answers given on separate occasions, each answer, (at least until the pattern was recognized by Vacchagotta) would provoke the repetition of the question. "Could it be that only ignorance (etc.) of body (etc.) results in all these theories?" This would have given the Buddha the opportunity to repeatedly develop for Vacchagotta the Buddhas breakdown of the components: body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness. There is no statement at the end of this series as to the outcome.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Defining/Translating <i>'Sati'.</i></h4>

					<p class="f4">I have written about some of the below before, but there is an interesting development which I came across yesterday which I believe warrants a recapitulation as a lead in. So:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is relatively well known that the word <i>'sati'</i> stands for both 'mind' and 'memory' (you can look it up in the PED if it is not well known to you), yet the translation 'mindfulness' persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not saying here that 'mindfulness' is not a correct understanding of an aspect of <i>sati.</i> I am saying that its use has overbalanced the meaning to the side of 'paying attention' and it does not provide the richness of the term I would suggest, that is, 'mind'.</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe the translation 'mindfulness' has actually distorted the understanding of, the intent of, the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> sutta which is to my reading an exercise in the setting up, strengthening and organization of the mind via observation, investigation (comparing memory with memory) and memory.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a little puzzle riddle game that I believe shows us both the origin of the word itself and its meaning:</p>

					<p class="f4">The word <i>'sati'</i> is made up of two syllables:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sa</i> = one, once; and <i>ti</i> = three, this, thus</p>

					<p class="f4">If you use the word <i>'sati'</i> as a <i>manta</i> (mantra), repeating it again and again 1,3; 1,3; 1,3 ... there comes a time when the word breaks open and one becomes aware that there is something missing. What is that? 'Two'. It should be 1,2,3. This becoming aware of an issue and recollecting a solution, produces a certain <i>sati</i>sfaction in the mind. This, I say, is the true meaning of sati: the satisfaction of a fulfilled memory which is another way of saying a satisfied mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of course modern linguists and philologists will have a conniption fit reading this. But I would remind them that language did not just appear whole bang snap fingers done right from the start. Maybe not this world cycle, but once upon a time it started from scratch. Probably from the sound 'Ah.' And there would have been a period where there was delight in the composition of words and thought given as to how to make words stand for things that one wished to communicate to others. Starting from a language made up of single syllables, how does one describe memory?</p>

					<p class="f4">And then we have: "Once Thus". What is that but memory?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind is, at its most basic, memory. This meaning is lost completely with the translation 'mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand 'mind' has been and still is used for the idea of 'paying attention'. "Mind the children." "Mind your manners."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Mind' for 'mind' does not need explanation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But 'mind' for 'remember' has eluded me until yesterday when in reading a very entertaining and 'worldly-educational' writer of cowboy stories (including Hopalong Cassidy), Louis L'amour, his "The Lonesome Gods", wherein he uses dialogue from c. 1850 I came across this exchange (pg 259):</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">We were looking at him, waiting. "Paulino Weaver, he's moved in over yonder. Been here for some time."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Mountain man," Jacob said. "I mind meeting him some while back. He's a good man."</p>

					<p class="f4">And now that I read this, I mind hearing it before, myself, in actual conversations.</p>

There is no need for commentary. Every important term is defined by Gotama himself. What is needed is not consultation with the commentaries, it is thorough examination of the suttas. When you have mastered the suttas it is then sometimes interesting to cosult the commentaries for background stories. There I say is their real value.<br />

					The Buddha explains that the <i>bhikkhus</i> have entered 'the lowest profession', that of scrap (or 'chunk', or 'glob' or 'mess') (see <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.096.pali.bd.htm#p14">SN 3.22.96</a> where it is used for a tiny 'bit' or 'lump' of dung) hunters, not from want of a livlihood or fears, but because it is in this way that some way out of all the pain in the world may be found.||<br />
					Although the term here is not <i>'bhikkhu'</i> (beggar), but <i>'pindola'</i> scrap hunter, or 'dole-man', someone on the dole, the spirit is the same. Many of the 'monks' of today object strenuously to being called 'beggars' and have completely missed the point: It is by adopting the lowest of callings that pride of birth is humbled and by showing those who are beggars as a consequence of their bad <i>kamma,</i>  that such a life can be lived with ease, generosity, virtue and dignity it teaches the way out of their misery. The translation of <i>'bhikkhu'</i> as 'monk' and of <i>'pindola'</i> as 'almsman' or 'mendacant' whitewashes the truth and destroys the lesson.<br />
					This sutta is also interesting in that it records a feat of magic power in which the <i>bhikkhus</i> are lead to believe they are appearing before the Buddha singly or in pairs though they are all addressed simultaneously.<br />

					Describing a method for quickly eliminating the corrupting influences of lust, existing and blindness, the Buddha shows how holding any sort of opinion or view that the self is, or has, or has within or is within form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, or consciousness, or even having doubt about such is own-making, and that which is own-made, is inconstant, and that which is inconstant is painful and that by getting rid of such opinions and doubts, one quickly gets rid of the corrupting influences.<br />
					This sutta focuses down on the idea of <i>saṅkhāra</i> in such a way as to make it absolutely clear that the meaning of this term is own-making, personalizing the objective, fabricating the individuality, con-structing the individuality, <i>own-making</i>.<br />

					The Buddha delivers a comprehensive discourse on the fuel stockpiles, the <i>'panc-upadana-kkhandha'.</i><br />
					Here is a really good example of how the <i>Dhamma</i> was propagated among the <i>bhikkhus.</i> Togethere with his five hundred pupils, face-to-face with the Buddha, a group teacher asks a series of questions which when answered by the Buddha elucidate the entire spectrum of doctrines concerning the <i>'pañc-upādāna-kkhandhā,'</i> the five fuel-stockpiles.

					There is some problem here with the identification of this Assaji with the Assaji who renounced the world with Gotama and who was the first teacher of Sāriputta. That Assaji would almost certainly have been called here 'Assaji Thera', where this Assaji is called '<i>āyasmā</i> Assaji, 'Elder'.

					The first of the similes for mind is <i>(caraṇaṇ nāma cittaṇ)</i> "heart called 'wanderer'" or "wandering (so named) heart" or "colors called 'meandering'" or "a meandering painting" or "a wandering bedazzlement" ... Bhk. Thanissaro translates as 'a moving contraption'; Bhk. Bodhi translates 'that picture called 'Faring On'. This is basically a 'fill in the blank' issue.

					This sutta contains the famous simile of the hand-prints on the adze handle, where to illustrate how, though it is for some difficult to perceive progress on a daily basis, over time one will be able to view the advantages, he points out that on a daily basis the carpenter does not see how much of the handle is warn away by his grip, over time he will see the imprint of his hand on the wood. This does not contradict the description of the <i>Dhamma</i> as being of immediate consequence. From the moment one abstains from a harmful activity, the possibility of consequences of such activity cease. This is referring to perception of such changes, and even there it is not saying that this ability to perceive is something that will necessarily take a long time.
