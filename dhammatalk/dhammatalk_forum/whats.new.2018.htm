					<p class="f4"><img src="../../resources/images/pdf.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="PDF" title="PDF" /><a href="../../resources/pdf/thanissaro.bhk/than.first.things.first.pdf">First Things First,</a> by Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu. A collection of essays. The essays included are: Honest to Goodness, Did the Buddha Teach Free Will?, In the Eyes of the Wise, First Things First, The Karma of Now, The Streams of Emotions, Worlds &amp; Their Cessation, Wisdom over Justice, All Winners, No Losers, How Pointy is One-pointedness?, The Limits of Description, and The Names for Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Special attention is brought to the essay: <i>The Karma of Now,</i> as it appears for the first time in this work.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is necessary to point out that the very idea of paying attention to the present moment is wrongly conceived of by the thousands of 'Meditation Masters' making their living telling people this is the goal of their practice not simply because it is not the goal taught by the Buddha; but because it is itself impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">What these teachers are doing is postulating a solid thing there which is 'you' perceiving a solid thing there which is 'your world.' This is simply the view of one conditioned by the subject, verb, object construction of the English language. Think: 'Youing (or I'ming) perceiving thating' for a language construction more closely aligned with the reality.</p>

					<p class="f4">The individual's world is based on an 'existing' world which is in constant flux right down and passed the atomic level both internally and externally. When that so called 'real' world is perceived through the senses that gives rise to the sense-consciousnesses of the individual senses which are in turn the basis for the mind's construction of an imaginary world now identified-with by the individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">In other words, the 'present' world has already happened by the time the individual is conscious of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the basis of one's perception of the world constantly changing, the world as perceived is also constantly changing and that not as a single unit, but various parts change at various rates. Which is the present moment there?</p>

					<p class="f4">In all events, there is no instruction to pay attention to the present moment, there is no instruction to pay attention to 'the here and now'. The whole idea comes from people already schooled to believe that 'be here now' is the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">What there is is the occasional statement that something should be noted, may be experienced, etc. 'in this visible thing' (<i>diṭṭh'eva dhamma</i>), e.g., some, practicing according to Dhamma, will come to realize Nibbāna 'in this visible thing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Paying attention to the breaths is only one practice among many others whose function is to see things as they are, not to be seeing things that are not there. You pay money for your Dhamma, you get what you pay for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aside from that the usual exception to the definition of <i>samādhi</i> as 'concentration'; the unbased asertion that <i>jhāna</i> means 'absorption' (PED: The state of mind left after the experience of the four <i>jhānas</i> is described as follows at <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.02.pali.bd.htm#pg76">D 1.76:</a> "with his heart thus serene, made pure, translucent, cultured, void of evil, supple, ready to act, firm and imperturbable." It will be seen that there is no suggestion of trance, but rather of an enhanced vitality. And there is nothing in the etymology of the word that has anything to do with absorption. Bhante then immediately defines <i>jhāyati</i> — to do <i>jhāna</i> — as meaning "to burn with a steady flame." <i>Jhāna</i> is 'knowing' and knowing at the level of the <i>jhānas</i> puts one at a point where control of one's world-making or own-making is possible; i.e., experiencing the bliss of being on top of things, or being serene); the definition of <i>saŋkhāra</i> as 'fabrication' which leaves us in the twist discussed at <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna Conditioned.</a> etc. But altogether not a bad read, especially as it is a short essay.</p>

					From the Introduction: "This booklet is a collection of pieces I have written over the past several years concerning the recent efforts to revive the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha in the Theravāda tradition."</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Edit: 'the position here'<br />
							See: <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/vp/03.cv/vp.03.cv.07.rdho.sbe.htm#p5">vp.03.cv.07.rdho.sbe.htm#p5</a> for the actual rules delineating the distinction between 'disunion' and 'schism'.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">It is well that Bhk. Thanissaro qualifies the discussion limiting it to the legitimacy under Theravāda tradition. [Edit: Without that it could be said that the Theravādins are saying that the Theravāda school is the only school in Buddhism which can claim a legitimate descent from the original Saŋgha. ... which is, of course, what they think.] In so far as that discussion goes we should yield to Bhk. Thanissaro as being probably the most knowledgable English-speaking Theravada Vinaya scholar. As to the question of Bhikkhunī ordination, the position here is that individuals' opinions do not constitute a schism in the order, that a schism requires not only the dispute between nine individuals, but also a clear dispute between one set and the Buddha and the Dhamma. A dispute over the meaning of a commonly agreed-upon wording of a rule, for example, would not in itself be a matter of schism. In other words any Buddhist Saŋgha out there that can demonstrate a clear line back to pre-"school" Buddhism where there has been no refutation of the Buddha or the Dhamma is just a matter of disagrement between individuals and is legitimately within the lineage of the original Saŋgha and that if such a Saŋgha is a Bhikkhunī Saŋgha it is legitimate. As to whether there is or is not such a Saŋgha in existence today ... we leave that to the concerned parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further than that I could not agree more with this, also extracted from the Introduction [bold/italics mine]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"... in a recent interview with two bhikkhunīs in Tricycle: The Buddhist Review (Winter, 2014). One of the questions was, 'What have been the effects upon your practice, either beneficial or detrimental, of no longer belonging to the lineage of a contemporary master?' One of the bhikkhunīs answered, 'The strongest connection I've had to lineage is through the Buddha, and certainly we haven't lost that connection.... Now I really feel a tangible connection to the bhikkhuni sangha wherever it is around the world... and going all the way back to the founder of the order, Mahapajapati, the Buddha's adoptive mother and aunt. On our main shrine we have an image of the Buddha and one of Mahapajapati. Those are my lineage holders." Then, later in the interview, the bhikkhunīs address the issue of how to judge reports of what the Buddha taught: "It's important to remember that the teachings were written down several hundreds of years after the Buddha's passing by Brahmans [priests] [Ed.: this is an incorrect statement!] who were aligned with the misogynistic worldview of their time. So of course that worldview flew into the records." "The one thing I always come back to is that compassion and wisdom are at the heart of the Buddha's teaching. If you cannot find either wisdom or compassion in something, then I don't feel it can be the Buddha's teaching."</p>

					<p class="f4">This attitude doesn't inspire confidence. Anyone with any experience in a good monastic Community knows that your own ideas of wisdom and compassion can be very mistaken and self-serving, and that it takes more than just an image on a shrine or a felt connection to a person dead for millennia to make you accept that fact. The true Dhamma is hard enough to learn simply from the texts. If one regards the texts as corrupt, and has no authoritative living guide to make one question one's ideas of Dhamma and Vinaya, <b><i>then one is simply training in line with one's own preconceived notions.</i></b> That is not training; and it would be irresponsible and uncompassionate to recommend to any woman that she place herself in such a situation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further than this it is very strange that those who are deeply passionate about this issue have turned on Bhk. Thanissaro for his stance and now view him a mysoginist and politically incorrect when in fact he is largely responsible for the idiotic 'he/she' and many other instances of a clear position as a stout advocate for the equality of women ... an advocacy that boarders on pandering! That he has become the bad guy is astounding!</p>

					<p>Edit: Wednesday, January 16, 2019 5:08 AM: In his translation of <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.070.hare.pts.htm#n5">AN 8.70 n.5</a> Hare notes the interesting fact that in <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.16.pali.bd.htm#pg112">DN 16</a> as well as AN 8.70 the Buddha is reported to have made statements that would indicate that he knew early-on that there would be women in the order. Please do not jump in and point to this as an example of how the editors must have messed with the suttas or that it shows that one or another or both are not EBT or are inauthentic, or about how this shows that the Buddha did not have psychic powers, etc. It is entirely consistant with many other cases that in spite of knowing that the probability for a certain event approaches 100%, one must still allow for the possibility of change in one's behavior and so act as if one were without certain knowledge.</p>

					Citta Hatthisariputta keeps interrupting the discourse of higher Dhamma by two elders and when told not to do so is defended by his friends who call him a wise bhikkhu capable of such a discussion. Maha Kotthita gently explains to them that although this bhikkhu has attained certain very high states of samādhi, he is nevertheless still world-bound and will soon leave the order. This happens and the bhikkhus are impressed and tell the Buddha who then tells them that Citta will soon tire of the worldly life and again join the order. And this too happens and Citta becomes an arahant.<br />
					Here we have an example of the psychic power of 'mind-reading', but another interesting thing about this sutta is the way Maha Kotthita approaches explaining the situation, that is in a highly indirect way. There is no mention of Citta, but only of 'some person' who may attain such and such a high state of mind, but because he is proud of this as a personal achievement and uses it to enhance his worldly situation this will result in the corruption of this achievement and his fall from the saŋgha. The fact that Citta does not recognize himself in the description and therefore takes no measures to correct himself tells the other bhikkhus why it is that he is not up to the discussion of higher Dhamma.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Sati.</i> Most translations conflate 'Sati' with 'Satipaṭṭhāna'. It is "Mind" and "Setting up the Mind". 'Satipaṭṭhāna' deals with the practices necessary to build up, organize and maintain the memory. Sati is the end-product, a mind above it all, seeing how body, experiences, mental states and The Dhamma come to be and burn out, watchful and careful, recollected, reviewing and calming down, overcoming any thirsts, ambitions and disappointments that may appear, able to recall in minute detail things said and done long ago.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Ekāyano ayaɱ Maggo.</i> The recommended solution, 'One Sure Way' is a reasonable read of the Pali, but mostly serves to eliminate the idea of 'one and only one way' which today offends some sensibilities. 'The One and Only Way' is problematic only to outsiders; those with insight into the holographic nature of the Dhamma will see that 'This One Way' encompasses the many other ways described in the Dhamma, and those other ways encompass this way.</p>

						<p class="f4">But what in Bhk. Sujato's translation, does 'convergence' mean here? Convergence with what? Convergence into Nibbāna? That would be a gloss and a bad one at that in that it requires foreknowledge of Dhamma and the Goal by the reader. As it is it doesn't make sense.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Kāya. (Vedana, Citta, Dhamma) Kāyānupassi.</i> Bhk. Bodhi's 'body as a body' is not helpful as an instruction as to how to organize one's memories over the entire category 'body'. The idea is to so observe that mode in which you live so as to have all that occurs in it organized; easily retrievable. That includes such things as seeing that the thing comes to be, is transient, brings pain, etc., as well as being just the thing it is. Bhk. Thanissaro's 'focusing on the body, etc., in and of itself' just passes, but misses the idea of these four things being modes of living. It could be 'observing an aspect' per Bhk. Sujato. It is also 'observing the whole', and observing how things that are not the body proper affect the body, etc., or point to the destiny of bodies, etc.. But the Pali does not point to either an aspect or the whole. The way it is phrased it covers all angles. All ignore the <i>'viharati'</i> where the idea is 'living in a body, one oversees (synonym for sati; minds) the body'. "Living in" means that this is the primary focus of one's daily habits. One lives primarily concerned with the body and its activities; another primarily with experiences; another primarily with one's mental states; another lives with everything referenced to the Dhamma.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā.</i> This word serves three functions in the Dhamma: Experience, Sense-experience and sensation. Experience when it is experience in general and when it is the extra-sensory experience of the Arahant; sense-experience when it is experience of an existing being; sensation when it is what is felt upon experience. Feeling covers only one of these uses.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Citta.</i> Translated 'mind' it removes vital information as to the nature of this mind. The broad idea is heart; not in the sense of the physical organ, but in the sense of 'at the heart of the matter' the central focus. And in other uses it conveys the idea of having the will to act.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Dhamma.</i> There are two forms in which this word appears: with capital "D" and with lower case "d". In the Pāḷi there is no such distinction. Determination of which is which must be made from context and sometimes that can be confusing. The former distinguishes the teachings of the Buddha and is a synonym of "Pāḷi". The latter means 'thing'. 'Principles' describes rules for behavior or judgment derived from some source. The Dhamma, specifically The Four Truths, is the source, not the principle. One could make aspects of the Dhamma into one's principles, one cannot turn the whole of the Dhamma into a set of principles. </p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Chanda.</i> This term must indicate some sort of will to act; Bhk Sujato's 'enthusiasm' in-and-of-itself has no component related to intent to act. Someone with enthusiasm could well have an intent to act, but that is a separate thing.</p>

						<p class="f4">The paths spelled out. So far I have not seen a translation of the paths that makes sense or really satisfies. Bhk. Sujato's construction makes sense, but where in it is <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> (his 'choices'? Oh! Here it is: 'active' [effort: padhāna]. So is 'Saŋkhāra' for him 'choices' or 'active'? And if both, how?

						<p class="f4"><i>Sambojjhangā.</i> Where is the 'sam' in the translations? These are the things that one needs in order to awaken one's self.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Dhamma-Vicaya.</i> How can one effectively investigate one's 'principles' (Bhk. Sujato) if one has not investigated the basis for forming principles? The term would most usefully indicate the fact that it is at this point that one investigates 'things' and 'the Dhamma'.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Pīti.</i> I believe it was Bhk. Thanissaro and his personal experience of what his teacher called 'rapture' (which sounds like it was in fact rapture of a sort) that has imposed that term on us for the translation of <i>Pīti.</i> But <i>Pīti</i> is in fact a term that covers an emotional liking that spans appreciation, mild liking, enthusiasm, excitement, friendly feelings, affection, love and higher order emotions such as rapture. A word is needed that encompasses the lot. </p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Samādhi.</i> <i>Samādhi</i> is not 'concentration'. Concentration is way too narrow a concept to cover the scope of <i>'samādhi'. Samādhi has</i> concentration, <i>uses</i> concentration, but is itself a state with flexible attention and is certainly open to interference by insights. As 'immersion' (Bhk. Sujato) this is precisely what <i>'samādhi'</i> is not. The word either means 'over and above' or 'even higher'. <i>Samādhi</i> is a state of full alertness while being in full control. And if the term is to align with the goals of the Dhamma, it needs to indicate not 'immersion in', but 'detachment from'. And this does not deal with the various other descriptions of <i>Samādhi</i> as encompassing the whole of the practice; as being also the states of signlessness, aimlessness and pointlessness, and consisting of three other sorts (see PED): with thinking and pondering; with pondering only; without thnking or pondering.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Upekkha.</i> Everyone loves equanimity. But 'equanimity' is a state of balance between two conditions. <i>Upekkha</i> is used two ways in the suttas: as a state balanced between two conditions; and as the state of being detached from all conditions. Not between any two things. Technically it is the difference between being freed from things of Time (the world, existence); and being freed from things not of Time (recognizing in the freedom from things of Time that this recognition is one step removed from freedom from things of Time and is an ultimate freedom which because it is not based on anything own-made (things of Time) it is not subject to change or pain.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Passaddhi, Samādhi, Upekkha.</i> These three need to form a progression. First you calm down and stop reacting: impassivity; then you become serene/above it all; then you detach.</p>

						<p class="f4">The Satta Sambojjhangā is a complete path to <i>Nibbāna.</i> Ask yourself if a path that ends in equanimity is one that does that. Disturbance is implicit in equanimity.</p>

							<p class="f4">Eight/Ten. The 'Ten' is generally more satisfying in that it can be set up: <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> as working hypothesis &gt; <i>Sammā Diṭṭhā</i> actual experience of seeing. The Eight still works but you need to work out how the story ends either through experience of Fourth <i>Jhāna</i> or from other suttas.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Sammā</i> and <i>Micchā</i> The idea of 'Sammā' is not that a 'sammā thing' is the right thing and all other things are wrong. The idea is that these things are the best choice among other choices which may be best for other purposes. Consummate, best, or highest. The opposite condition is not 'wrong'. It means 'contrary' or 'misguided', or 'opposing'. Why should such an established set of terms be altered? Because hanging on to things being 'right' or 'wrong' is taking sides and holding points of view and that is involvement with the world and the fact that the individual is blind to that fact precludes their escape from such views.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Diṭṭhi.</i> 'View' works if one remembers that 'views' are opinions and opinions are not necessarily true and that what is required to put this step of the path into action is to use Sammā Diṭṭhi as a working hypothesis; to be proved by trial and error following the rest of the path. Using the ten-fold path one is almost compelled to use 'working hypothesis' to avoid an incomprehensible redundancy.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Saɱkappa.</i> This is 'principles'. First one sets up one's working hypothesis, then one determines the principles that follow from that working hypothesis. If it is all pain, what is one's first principle? Dumping it.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Kammanta.</i> To say this term stands for 'action' is to ignore the common context of 'commerse' and to force it into being an exact synonym of kamma which it is not. The word is really a manta, a composite term that means: Work, mantras, commerse. 'Works' covers all this.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Ājīva.</i> The word means 'to live'. What one does to live. So 'livelihood' and 'living' would work if the term did not so completely ignore the idea of making a living or earning one's keep. Sammā ājīva is the practice of analyzing one's situation and determining those aspects of it that are causing good states to vanish or diminish and bad states to appear or increase and getting rid of them. It is a style or manner of living to be applied to every aspect of one's life, not just a way of earning a living.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Vāyāma.</i> A synonym for <i>'padhānā'.</i> The effort being made is to establish self-control.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Avijjā.</i> Not-vision. Not 'ignorance'. Not seeing. The simile is of two men standing at the foot of a mountain. One climbs to the top and describes the 360° angle of view; the other denies that such a view is possible. The first comes down and brings the second up to the top where he sees what he could not see before. At the foot of the mountain #2 could know in theory about (have knowledge of) what can be seen from a height but could not see it. The term needs to indicate a lack of actual experience of seeing: blindness.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Ñāṇa.</i> Knowlege. Book knowledge. The Streamwinner has '<i>Ñāṇa and Dassana</i>': knowing and seeing (of the fact that whatsoever has come to be will allso pass away). The Arahant has first <i>Vijjā</i> (he sees the Four Truths as they are) then <i>Upekkhā</i> (Detachment) ... but it is also said of the Arahant (Arahants are also Streamwinners) that he has knowledge and vision.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Vimutti.</i> Freedom is correct. Release is 'Vimokkha'. Release implies a possibly temporary state, freedom points to the absolute state. We want the absolute state and the progression in the suttas is from Vimokkha to vimutti.</p>

						<p class="f4">The position here relative to the whole of the <i>Pāḷi,</i> but most particularly to the <i>jhānas</i> is that there is no-one living today that it is reasonable to trust as to personal claims at experience of such that would inform anything other than a translation that held tightly to the etymological, literal and contextual Pāḷi (<b>all three!</b>). This makes Bhk. Sujato odd man out when it comes to his translation of the formulas for the <i>jhānas</i> (and some other terms).</p>

						<p class="f4">The way he has constructed the <i>jhānas</i> one begins by sitting down and focusing mindfulness right there (<i>parimukhaɱ satim</i>) (without saying what 'right there' means), and, without instruction as to abandoning thinking and pondering (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> outside <i>jhāna</i> where he accepts this meaning in so many words) one abandons thinking and pondering (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>) classing it as 'unskillful' (though there are clearly skillful thoughts or how would one ever think to study the <i>Dhamma</i>?); then in addition to focusing mindfulness right there (<i>parimukhaɱ satim</i>), one places the mind and keeps it connected (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> inside <i>jhāna</i> — though there is no distinction made anywhere in the suttas as to an inside and outside <i>jhāna vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>) (connected to what is not specified) and somehow by solitude alone, rapture (the highest defined meaning of <i>pīti</i>) and bliss arise.</p>

						<p class="f4">That is quite an accomplishment for the first stage of a progression of steps leading away from involvement with such things of the world as sensuality and unskillful things.</p>

						<p class="f4">The position here is that the first <i>jhāna</i> is the first step up off active involvement with the world. You are still thinking as you were before <i>jhāna,</i> but now the thoughts and pondering are constructive towards achieving the goal: thinkinig and pondering over problems interfering with living the Dhamma and understanding the Dhamma, ending in the transition from the first to the second <i>jhāna</i> when one has reached the point where thinking and pondering are not needed, at least for the time being. Thus the first <i>jhāna</i> is relatively easy to get to in it's simplest form, but it evolves in depth as one's practice evolves.</p>

						<p class="f4">[Editorial insert: Invision the first jhāna in something like the way one experiences the first view of the Pacific Ocean. The first sight of the Pacific, as one reaches the top of the last hill of the Coast Range, is that the Ocean is above one. Then, when standing next to the last advance of a wave on the beach, looking out, one might ask: "Is this the Pacific Ocean?" and the correct answer would be: "Yes, but the full scope of the Pacific is immeasurably larger than what you can see from this vantage point."</p>

						<p class="f4">What is necessary for the first <i>jhāna</i> is solitude and an appreciation of that solitude. This way there is nothing hidden from view: the factors of the <i>jhānas</i> are stated and then removed a bit at a time as indicated in the formulas. Going beyond what is there is hubris.</p>

						<p class="f4">Then, for the second <i>jhāna,</i> after all our work of sitting down and focusing mindfulness right there (<i>parimukhaɱ satim</i>), without instruction as to how it happens, placing the mind and keeping it connected (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> inside <i>jhāna</i>) are stilled.</p>

						<p class="f4">Where is this headed? I have a theory. Bhikkhu Sujato's view of the <i>jhānas</i> is one which cannot be practiced. Trying to do it per Bhk. Sujato's formula results in getting twisted up like a pretzel. Looking to the outcome as the intent we recollect the early statements of commentators that the <i>jhānas</i> are no longer possible to attain. This is great cover for one who has no ability to achieve <i>jhāna</i> as described in the suttas using plain speaking Pali. This in turn strengthens reliance on the commentaries which strengthens the rapidly self-destructing pre-eminance of the Theravada tradition. How Bhk. Sujato, who at one time spoke of his 'almost being ashamed of being a Theravadan Bhikkhu' and who also has published works criticizing the commentaries ended up on the side of the commentators with this position is a mystery. Or not. The position serves well as a cover for those who can't, whether ancient or modern.</p>

						<p class="f4">Bhk. Sujato's formulas for <i>jhānas</i> three and four are more or less standard.</p>

						<p class="f4">Here is the thing: However translated the formulas for the <i>jhānas</i> must go from involvement to less involvement with the world. The Four are a progression ending in utter detachment. Generally, following the recommended formulas or those of the others except Bhk. Sujato's one does go from involvement to detachment. Using Bhk. Sujato's formula you go spinning around and around never getting even to the first <i>jhāna.</i></p>

Sujato's 'choices' is a matter of taking one factor of a process and calling it the whole process. What we are doing here is making trouble for ourselves by continuously re-creating existence in a personal world.

					<p class="f4">Menander I Soter (Ancient Greek: Μένανδρος Αʹ ὁ Σωτήρ, Ménandros Aʹ ho Sōtḗr, "Menander I the Saviour"; known in Indian Pali sources as Milinda) was an Indo-Greek King of the Indo-Greek Kingdom (165/155–130 BC) who administered a large empire in the Northwestern regions of the Indian Subcontinent from his capital at Sagala. Menander is noted for having become a patron of Buddhism.</p>

					<p class="f4">Menander was initially a king of Bactria. After conquering the Punjab he established an empire in the Indian Subcontinent stretching from the Kabul River valley in the west to the Ravi River in the east, and from the Swat River valley in the north to Arachosia (the Helmand Province). Ancient Indian writers indicate that he launched expeditions southward into Rajasthan and as far east down the Ganges River Valley as Pataliputra (Patna), and the Greek geographer Strabo wrote that he "conquered more tribes than Alexander the Great."</p>

					<p class="f4">Greetings my friends. Please stop for a second and rouse your attention to the following argument for the translation of 'Jhāna' as 'knowing'.</p>

					<p class="f4">If "Jhāna" is "knowing", as in the ordinary sense of knowing, what distinguishes ordinary knowing from the knowing of the First Jhāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">What does one know in the First Jhāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">One knows that this knowing is separated from wishing for sensual pleasures,<br />
					separated from unskillful things.</p>

					<p class="f4">One knows an appreciation of the pleasures of solitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">One knows that there is in this knowing thinking and pondering.</p>

					<p class="f4">One knows that this state is higher, more refined and altogether superior to the ordinary state of mind and that this is a clear indication that one is going in the right direction when going from the ordinary state of knowing to this state of knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">And one knows that:</p>

					<p class="f4">Separated from wishing for sensual pleasures,<br />
					separated from unskillful things,<br />
					with thinking,<br />
					with pondering<br />
					by integrating<br />
					solitude-born pleasureable-enthusiasm<br />
					one habituates the First Knowing.</p>

					Describes how attraction to and pondering the pleasures of contact with the opposite sex leads to the bondage of women to men and men to women and both to their respective sexes.<br />
					A sutta for anyone trying to deal with celebacy but also a sutta which reveals the real dyanamic of bondage to sexuality. It should also be of special interest to all those concerned with women's liberation as it clearly points out the error of blaming the other sex for one's bondage to it. In essence it is saying that sexual bondage is a reflection of self-love and that to free one's self from the bondage, one must free one's self from the self-love.<br />
					I can also see this sutta applying to the case of homosexuality, where the obsession with persons of the same sex is coming from an obsession with the marks of the opposite sex within one's self.<br />
					Another angle to this sutta is revealed in a story concerning the origin of femininity.</p>

							<p class="f4">Look at the line reading:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Itthatte bhikkhave, abhiratā <b>sattā</b> purisesu saɱyogaɱ gatā.</i></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Indulging in their feminity, beggars,<br />
					<b>beings</b> yoke themselves to masculinity.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverse is also stated.</p>

					<p class="f4">First you need to know that at the Brahma-loka level and above there is no femininity; all beings there and above are classed as males.</p>

					<p class="f4">Femininity, according to this story, began with one brahma-god gazing fondly on the beauty of another brahma-god. The gazed-upon, delighting in the attention exagerates those aspects of himself which are attractive to the other and the story begins. According to this view life originates as masculine and devolves into the feminine.</p>

					<p class="f4">I think there is another book that says something like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">The corollary is that the evolution of the individual, as opposed to the evolution of the species, (see: <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/ethical_culture/evolution.htm">Buddhism and the Idea of Evolution</a>) can go both ways ... so to speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a great deal of sputtering by women with no understanding concerning the fact that Buddhism holds that these higher realms are occupied by males exclusively, that Maras and Buddhas and Wheel-turning Emporors are always males; that women bhikkhus should always act deferentially towards male bhikkhus, etc. That griping is misplaced and reflects a lack of vision and a disbelief in rebirth. With the belief in rebirth there is a relaxed perspective concerning such things. A woman, truely desiring to becme a Mara or Buddha is going to face millions of years of training both as male and female and as a multiplicity of different species; there will be plenty of time to become a male. Women desiring to become a Wheel-turning-Emporor will also require extensive training in a variety of rebirths in which there will be plenty of opportunity to becme a male. Women desiring to enter the Brahma loka or who become non-returners in brahma lokas will be reborn there as males.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not the one saying this. This is the way it is in the suttas. (see: <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/01_ones/an01.258-295.olds.bd.htm#p280">AN 1.280 ff.;</a> <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p51">AN 51</a>) What I can see is the logic of the situation. Maras and Buddhas need to command respect. A woman simply does not command the respect of a male in this world, right or wrong. The need for the respect of these stations overrides the need for 'fairness' or 'equal opportunity' between the sexes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, as to the ever-bubbling-up carping at the statement that allowing women to enter the order reduced the lifespan of the Dhamma, the logic is also clear: If men alone had been allowed to enter the order, women who desired to enter the order could become men in the next birth and do so then, thus stretching out the pool of candidates for positions in the Saŋgha and lengthining its life. But women, demonstrating in the clearest possible way that it is their excessive indulgence in the emotional that results in their being disrespected, went on to mess with the story in a tragic way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do I need to say this? None of this, in any way justifies practices in this world which discriminate against women. In fact, I'd put a nickel on the likelihood that discriminative behavior towards women was a key factor in rebirth as a woman. See how you like it. On the other hand to say that the way women dress and make themselves up here today [USA Thursday, November 08, 2018 5:55 PM] is not provocation to sexual advances (there is a lesson there in flowers and the means they use to attract pollinators, that I am sure you can see) is absolute blindness or calculated deception. And for women to say that men should learn better self control when provoked is also to be blind to the reality of the weaknesses of the majority of men. Life is a game, you either play it or you don't; if you do, you lose. If you don't like the way the game ends up always hurting you, stop playing. Stop playing with fire and you will be burned less often. What you shouldn't waste your time doing is trying to stop the game. There's too much money in it. Let it go.</p>

					<p class="f1"><a id="san">ON ANOTHER NOTE</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The careful reader will note that I have translated <i>'Saɱyoga'</i> as 'self-yoking' where 'self' = 'saɱ'. As in the case of my translation of <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> as 'own-' I am attempting to come to grips with the fact that this most-used prefix is very seldom an aspect of the translated term, e.g.: Hare, Bhk. Thanissaro: 'bondage'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'union'; Sister Upalavanna: 'association'. All of those could be translations of the 'yoga' part without reference to the 'coɱ'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why would this be?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have a theory. I speculate that the original term (in all forms: <i>sa san saŋ saɱ</i>) as coined by the originators of language itself had a meaning intended to convey the idea of ownership, personalization, self or something relating to the self and that while the sheer number of words using this prefix made it impossible for later generations, more democratic (or less self-centered) in inclinations, to change the spelling, what they did in stead was to change the meaning of the prefix; convert the idea of 'self' or 'own' to 'with', as in 'by-way-of' or 'together with' which happily eliminates the idea that the individual has any function in the creation of his world. Goal accomplished. In other words I am saying that in the Buddhist vocabulary, the prefix is meaningful and should be being con-sidered alongsid er more con-ventional renderings. Right here, for example, with the two terms <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> and <i>'saɱyoga'</i> we have, in stead of, say 'fabrication' and 'bondage', the much more informative 'own-making' and 'self-yoking': for is it not the entire dynamic involved in the process of being reborn the poking one's head into the yoke, the yoking of one's identity, to an existing thing in the world and calling the result 'my own'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, as to the translations 'fabrication', and 'construction' for <i>saŋkhāra</i> I say these amount to saying that <i>'kamma'</i> and <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> are exact synonyms. I say, however that there is and needs to be a distinction between the two because the context clearly indicates that they represent two different sorts of action with two different sorts of outcomes. A person may act to create a personal identity; that is <i>'saŋkhāra'.</i> Or a person may act in response to an external stimulus with the intent to bring some <i>kamma</i> to conclusion. That is <i>kamma</i> that carries no consequences. The one <i>(kamma)</i> speaks to the objective view of the relationship of intent to action and outcome; the other <i>(saŋkhāra)</i> speaks to the subjective aspects of the intent to personally experience existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">The translations of the Four Nikāyas by Bhk. Sujato and his computer.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is, I believe, the first attempt at translation of the Four Nikāyas by way of what I think is now being called 'machine-assisted translation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At an earlier point I was all for such an approach to a unified translation: no more. The result here is far from 'unified' and is subject to the ignorance and resulting translation quirks of the human part of the mechanics. Examples: <i>'Vitakka and Vicara'</i> has, among several others, the translation "placing the mind and keeping it there", which is indefensible (as can be seen by the non-response of Bhk. Sujato to a barrage of <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/yarvvi-chronicles-v-v-vitakka-directed-thoughts-vicara-evaluation-of-said-vitakka/10182">essays by frankk</a> on <a href="https://discourse.suttacentral.net/latest">Bhk. Sujato's discussion board</a>); <i>'Saŋkhāra'</i> has (also among others) the translation 'choices' which is to describe one aspect of a spectrum of activities and their consequences and call it the entire process. Add to this list my usual gripes: 'Right' for <i>Sammā;</i> etc.</p>

					<p class="f4">Needless to say if you have any concern for your salvation and if you have any trust in the way the system is being described here, put this translation at the bottom of your list of reads. I include it here because good or bad it is an historical milestone. And, as with all the translations out there today and with all those likely to appear in the future, we have the wonderful fact that 90% of what is being taught in the Dhamma does not require great sophistication — the practices of giving, ethical culture and self-discipline are what most people need to hear about and the precise language used to encourage such behavior is not particularly critical.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still: Reader Beware! This bhikkhu is deeply involved in worldly activism: i.e., he is going in precisely the opposite direction of what is being described here as the aim of the Dhamma. His translations reflect his views. The result is that he has become a dynamic force in  neo-Buddhism, a movement which essentially aligns a view of the Buddhist goal with that of Christianity and Mahayana Buddhism.

					<p class="f4">As a side-issue it is very strangely incongruous that this work is being promoted as the first translation choice on <a href="https://suttacentral.net/">Sutta Central</a> which has as it's stated purpose the attempt to determine the most original and authentic of the early Buddhist suttas. So the implied suggestion is 'Find the most authentic version of a sutta and read the most inauthentic translation ever produced.</p>

It is one of the three principle Pure Land sutras along with the Infinite Life Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra. Amitāyus is another name for the Buddha Amitābha, the preeminent figure in Pure Land Buddhism, and this sutra focuses mainly on meditations involving complex visualization. This is reflected in the name of the sutra, which translates to the "Amitāyus Meditation Sūtra."<br />
					It is generally considered by modern scholarship to be apocryphal, a composition originally written in Chinese. No Sanskrit original has been discovered and the Sanskrit name and Sanskrit versions would thus be reverse translations. According to Paul Williams, a more accurate Sanskrit title for this text would be Amitāyurbuddhānusmṛti Sūtra, meaning "Amitāyus Buddha-mindfulness Sūtra."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> As well as bringing the terminology into alignment with our modern situation, the order of the rules has been changed to point to the fact that when the leaders of a nation act with nobility, the people will respect them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Leading citizens. This is both those in government service and private citizens with leadership qualifications. Influential people.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This may seem impossible in this world as it is today, but the idea is sound: keep out of the discussion those topics which are a source of conflict. Arrive at consensus. Deal with devisive issues privately until agreement can be reached.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> With 40,000 + new laws being created every year in this country, the logic of this rule is obvious. What is needed is a basic set of rules such as is found in the original Constitution of the United States, and a system of judges that will wisely interpret those rules as they apply to individual cases. In other words in stead of laws, there should be presidents. The proliferation of laws has made virtually everyone in the world a criminal in one way or another. Such a state of things does not contribute to the respect for the rule of law.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The idea is that with abusive behavior comes resentment and division of the people from within.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Sacred places of all faiths! This was adapted to conform to the fact that there are multiple faiths practiced today in most nation-states.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The original term used was 'Arahant'. This term means 'one who is worthy'. The definition of 'worthy' changes, but here means 'noble': Holy men and truth-seekers, the innocent, the generous, hard-working, enterprising, ethical, self-disciplined, and wise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> A natural consequence of following the previous six rules.</p>

					The difficult phrase to understand here is <i>pariyantakatassa dukkhaɱ na hoti</i> 'restricted-doing pain not had'. Hare: "none of the ill of the restricted" [is had]; Bhk. Thanissaro: "There is no suffering over what has had a limit placed on it" speculating that this may mean that there is no suffering in such an individual over the fact that the number of his future rebirths is limited, or that it might mean that the pain that is suffered is limited to the life and body that remain (7 more at most); Bhk. Bodhi: "one's suffering is delimited" I have "There is no pain resulting from doing's restrictions." I am speculating that the meaning is that at the point of Stream-entry one has seen the point of restricted activity — one no longer sees training in abstention as having to follow burdensome 'rules' — but that in a world in which ending is inevitable, abstention from doings relates absolutely to freedom from kammic consequences and their endings and renewals and the pain accompanying such and no longer suffers at such restrictions.</p>

					That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,<br />

					For all the accommodations that thou bear'st<br />
					Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;<br />
					For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork<br />
					Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,<br />
					And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st<br />
					Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;<br />
					For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains<br />
					That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;<br />
					For what thou has not, still thou strivest to get,<br />
					And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;<br />
					For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,<br />
					After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;<br />
					For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,<br />
					Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,<br />
					And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;<br />
					For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,<br />
					The mere effusion of thy proper loins,<br />
					Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheun,<br />
					For ending thee no sooner. Thou has nor youth nor age,<br />
					But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,<br />

					<p>Recommended read: Anthony Bourdain, Medium Raw, Chapter 18: My Aim Is True, pages 233=252. Ecco an imprint of Harper Collins Publishers, 2011. The whole book is a good read, but this chapter in particular is a really vivid picture of an ordinary person who has mastered <i>samādhi.</i> This is not <i>'Sammā' Samadhi'</i> or the highest form of <i>samādhi,</i> but it has all the components and has the advantage of being completely divorced from any notion of <i>samādhi</i> as a religious accomplishment ... in other words, it is free from bias from that perspective. It is a perfect example of what I have referred to as the experience of musicians and artists and sometimes writers called 'being on top of it.' Here you have intention, thinking and planning, organization, preparation, setting, concentration and execution all working together so smoothly that it so shines out that all who see this man at work are filled with admiration.</p>

The corrupting influences are likened to a running sore. <b>The sense pleasures</b> are likened to a meatless bone, carrion attacked by vultures, a blazing torch carried against the wind, falling into a pit of glowing charcoal, a loan, having climbed a tree to enjoy the fruit while another man is chopping it down [see <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p54">MN 54</a>]; its mark is the pleasure, excitement, enjoyment, and delight in experience through the senses. <b>Existence</b> is likened to a man wandering in a waterless desert overcome with thirst and fatigue. It occurs with the conjunction of consciousness with named-shapes and is the single condition which, if eliminated, eliminates old age, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair; its marks are perception through the senses, and the presence of the thought "I am", "This is me" "This is myself", "This is mine." <b>Blindness</b> is likened to the man standing at the foot of a mountain disputing the view of his friend standing at the peak; a hidden thing; a man lost in the woods; beings exising in the dark unable to see visible shapes. It is the not seeing that 'this' is pain, that the origin of this pain is thirst, that the end of this pain is the end of that thirst, and that <a href="../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">the way</a> is the way to walk the walk that ends thirst; its mark is having an opinion about things; wanting to 'do' to create experience for the self. Clinging to <b>Point of view</b> is likened to a man pierced by a poison arrow who insists on knowing the maker of the arrow and other details about the arrow before he submits to treament for the poison. Point of view is forming an opinion from experience beyond direct observation. It generally involves the necessity to know all things at all times. To say: 'This is not myself,' is the statement of a direct observation about a thing under observation; it involves the need only to recognize the characteristic of change in that single thing; to say: 'There is no self' is the statement of an opinion formed about all things drawn from such a direct observation and is a point of view. One can state that there is no thing that is the self based on the direct observation that by the nature of existence as a phenomena occuring in and dependent on time, any thing that has come into existence is subject to time and consequently comes to an end, and that therefore all things that exist are out of one's control, and cannot because of that rightfully be called one's own, or that which belongs to the self. That is still not saying 'There is no Self' and is a statement of an observable fact, not a point of view. All behavior within existence is founded on a point of view. To extract the mind from existence by abandoning points of view, one adopts an intermediate point of view based on what is not a point of view, which aims at eliminating blindness, and which is not attached to issues of existence and non-existence but on observable phenomena which will lead to the abandoning of existence, that is, it directs the attention to pain and its elimination, that is, the Four Truths: 'This is Pain'; 'The origin of Pain is Thirst' the ending of Pain is the ending of that Thirst; and the Way is the way to do it. The mark of point of view is the presence of the thought "It is ... was, will be; It is not ... was not, will not be; This is the truth and all other beliefs are foolish."</p>

					Although Nibbāna is indescribable, the Buddha had many names for it to suggest why it's a desirable goal. This short article discusses five aspects of nibbāna suggested by these names.<br />
					This very short essay appears to be an effort to clarify Bhk. Thanissaro's stand on <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/green_tea/green_tea_toc.htm"><i>Viññāṇa Anidassana.</i></a> I will take this as an excuse to attempt to clarify the difference between Bhk. Thanissaro's take and the one presented here.</p>

					<p>Here is the relevant paragraph in Bhk. Thanissaro's essay:</p>

							<p class="in2"><i>"The first</i> [of five different facets of Nibbāna] <i>is that it's not a blank of nothingness. Instead, it's a type of consciousness. But unlike ordinary consciousness, it's not known through the six senses, and it doesn't engage in fabricating any experience at all — unlike, for example, the non-dual consciousness found in formless levels of concentration. The Buddha described this consciousness as "without surface" and "unestablished." His image for it is a beam of light that lands nowhere. Although bright in and of itself, it doesn't engage in anything, and so can't be detected by anyone else."</i></p>

					<p><b>Where We Agree</b></p>

					<p>We both agree that <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> is a name for Nibbāna;<br />
					we both agree that this is of the nature of what we call consciousness;<br />
					we both agree that this consciousness is not of or by way of or known through the six senses. I would add that this means it is not a feature of an existing being.</p>

					<p><b>Mixed Bag</b></p>

					<p>When Bhk. Thanissaro speaks of a non-dual consciousness found in formless levels of concentration as being an example of doing fabricating [<i>saŋkhāra</i>] of experience [<i>vedana</i>] he is narrowing the case too much; <i>at all levels of existence</i> [<i>bhava</i>] consciousness results [<i>paccaya</i>] in named/forms [<i>nāma/rūpa</i>], named/forms result in consciousness: i.e., existence through sense-experience. [<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15"><i>MN</i> 15</a>] And PS: the Buddha does not speak about consciousness as having two forms, one that is dual and one that is non-dual; he does speak of 'sorts of consciousnesses'. All sense-consciousness (the consciousness of living existing beings including those residing in the formless realms) is dual (there is the individuality identifying with the consciousness and there is the consciousness itself); <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> which is outside of existence, is non-dual, it has no individuality associated with it, identifying with it. We agree that <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> does not act/is not to be characterized as an aspect of the formation of an individuality experiencing existence, that is, in this case, consciousness is not a factor of the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> except as an inference drawn from the conclusion/purpose of that formula.</p>

					<p><b>Where we part company</b></p>

					<p>I do not translate <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> as 'consciousness without surface', or 'unestablished'. Neither 'surface' nor 'establishment' is found in the term itself and it is not required by the context. Bhk. Thanissaro's translation appears to be a gloss resulting from his understanding of the simile. 'A ni-dassana' = 'Not-down-seen.' We might say: "Not to be seen down here." So I prefer: 'Not to be pinned down', or 'invisible'. But this is not important.</p>

					<p>We disagree about whether or not <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> is <i>conditioned.</i> The Buddha does not say that Nibbāna is not conditioned [<i>a-paccaya</i>]; he says it is not own-made [<i>a-saŋkhāra</i>]. Bhk. Thanissaro seems to contradict himself in this when he later states speaking of 'cause' [? <i>hetu</i>]: "Even though this dimension is uncaused, a path of practice leads to it - in the same way that a road to a mountain doesn't cause the mountain ... ."<br />
					I would say in return: To say that a path of practice results in <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> is by definition to say that that path of practice was a 'condition' [<i>paccaya</i>} of its arising if not its cause.</p>

					<p><i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> <b><i>is</i></b> conditioned [paccaya]; it is the result of something, that is, following the Magga. What it is not is own-made [<i>saŋkhāra</i>'d, made by way of the intentions and acts of an individual seeking to create the experience of existence for himself. See: <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna Conditioned?</a> in the discussion forum.]</p>

					<p><b>The Significance of the Differences</b></p>

					<p>When <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana,</i> when <i>saŋkhāra</i> is  mis-translated as 'condition,' is stated to be a thing that is unconditioned, and when one recollects the statement made by the Buddha that all consciousness (high, low, in-between) is conditined [<i>paccaya</i>], the mis-translation results in <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana/Nibbāna</i> being impossible to attain.</p>

					<p>But when <i>Viññāṇa Anidassana</i> is held to be 'conditioned' [<i>paccaya</i>'d] by following the Magga, but is not 'own-made' [<i>saŋkhāra</i>'d], then it is possible to attain.</p>

					<p><b>Mechanism of Action</b></p>

					<p>Following the Magga is a practice which involves the special kamma that carries no kammic result.</p>

					<p>The Magga is a path constructed of instructions as to what to intentionally abstain from doing.</p>

					<p>When one follows <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi,</i> one abandons points of view concerning existence and non-existence. When one follows <i>Sammā Vaca,</i> one abstains from lies, etc. The result of not-doing is not an existing something, not an own-made thing/experience, not a <i>saŋkhāra</i>'d thing, it is a <i>consequential</i> result of the not-doing. What has resulted is the possibility of a perception based on freedom from what would have resulted had one 'done'. (Such perception is not guaranteed! It is required that at such a time as the mind has attained the freedom from results that follows not-doing, that freedom must be recognized as Nibbāna.)</p>

					<p>What one did was abstain from own-making, (one intentionally did not 'do'). That was as far as the individual was involved in the action and that is as far as own-making goes: <i>saŋkhāra</i> is not an exact synynym for <i>kamma.</i> We might say that there are two results from this not-doing: the non-experiencing of what might have been the result of doing (that is the own-made result), and the consciousness that results from knowing the freedom from that result (that is a result that has appeared because of conditions, but is not a result of own-making).</p>

					<p>Again: the result [<i>paccaya;</i> condition] was not something done by the individual and was not something that 'became'. It is a state of consciousness not grounded on what exists but on freedom from things of existence.</p>

					<p>The difference therefore between what is described here and what Bhk. Thanissaro is describing is not in the end result but in the terms needed to be employed in order to see the way to that result. Bhk. Thanissaro leaves us with an unnecessary mystery, and the result for him has been a huge outcry in the Buddhist Community that he is promoting a sort of Bodhi mind.
					He is not. But in not carefully noting the earlier mis-translation of <i>saŋkhāra</i> as 'condition', he leaves the practitiner who follows his ideas with no way to attain the goal and with the goal itself in doubt: is it conditioned?, and if not, how is it to be arrived at since every action taken to arrive at it would condition it?</p>

					<p>Again, the underlying stumbling block to understanding this whole thing is not understanding the Buddhist definition of 'existence' as being limited to that which is formed by consciousness in conjunction with named/forms: a definition which allows for things like consciousness which is not associated with the named/form 'identified-with sense experience'.</p>

					<p>My say.</p>

					<p>Edit: I translate saŋkhāra as 'own-making'; 'construction' or even 'fabricating' work just as well in my argument as long as it is remembered that what this means is 'construction by an individual identifying with the intent to create <i>personal</i> experience for himself by way of acts of thought, speech and body. <i>Avijja paccaya saŋkhāra.</i> Not seeing that the construction of a personal world is the construction of personal pain, one constructs the personal world.</p>

					The Buddha describes five factors which assure good results from hearing Dhamma. Bhk. Thanissaro's translation contains a lengthy discussion of the term <i>ek'agga-citto.</i> His conclusion: this term should not be being translated 'one-pointed' when found as an aspect of <i>jhāna</i> descriptions. He translates: 'a mind gathered into one'. I would prefer to see the term translated 'focus' which would be supported by all the arguments made in this footnote and is a bit clearer as to the meaning. I have also used 'whole heartedly single-minded' which is actually translating the term twice, but fits the phenomena as experienced. Here I have used just 'whole-heartedly'.</p>

						<p class="f4 ctr">The Buddha to his son:</p>

						<p class="f4 ctr">Rāhula, I say of anyone who has no shame at intentional lying:<br />

						<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p>How does this work?</p>

						<p>Because the lie is not based on the real, it cannot be remembered by a review of the real; because it cannot be remembered by a review of the real, it must use a separate unit of memory in order to be remembered (i.e., one must remember to remember what one said). That means that for each lie there is one unit for the lie, and one unit for the maintaining of the lie in memory. Each additional use of that lie, and each additional lie to support the lie also requires that double load on the memory. At a certain point the ability of the liar to maintain a coherant picture of his own reality breaks down under the complex <i>web he weaved when first he practiced to deceive</i>. For such a one the world as a real thing becomes a world of pure personal fantasy. At this point the liar no longer even thinks that the lies he is telling are lies, or that there is any harm in such speech. As far as such an individual is concerned the only thing in his world that matters is himself. Everything else just needs to be as he wants it to be. In his world, as fantasy, there is no barrior in fear of blame or sense of shame preventing him from any other kind of self-interested behaviors. The fury of such a person when crossed is the wrath of God! And, as we know from history, the wrath of God condones any sort of evil deed.</p>

					Some things should be kept in mind when thinking over and pondering the meaning of these two suttas while in the first <i>jhāna</i>: The <i>Nivaraṇas</i> are not 'obstructions', they are 'diversions'. The simile [in AN 5.51] is of something that is diverting, not obstructing, the forward momentum of a stream. Then think about the fact that that which obstructs does not involve the will of the individual or necessarily reduce his strength or wisdom, whereas diversions are by their nature participated in by the individual and weaken (by dividing his attention) his will power and diminish his wisdom (by removing it from its base at the center). The point is the need to take responsibility. Don Juan would call these 'self-indulgences'. Thinking this way of the <i>nivaraṇa</i> one has allowed the possibility of their removal by putting them under the control of the individual. Obstructions come from the outside and their appearance cannot be controlled, diversions are self-created and can be abstained from. No action required. Just not-doing. The trick is to be fast enough to see where one is, one's self, allowing the mind to become diverted from the goal.</p>

					The Buddha describes four sorts of persons in relationship to the sorts of self-yokings to rebirth <i>(saŋyojanāni)</i> they have or have not yet got rid of. This sutta is especially relevant to the debate concerning whether or not there is for some a sort of continued existence between the time of death and the next rebirth.<br />
					The key phrase to understand here is: <i>Antarā-parinibbāyissa. Antarā</i> from <i>antara:</i> in the interstice, "in between". Presumably after death and before final Nibbāna; but could it also mean after having abandoned the self-yokes that would otherwise have lead him at death to some sort of rebirth have been let go, and before final Nibbāna? This latter would allow the argument that there was no continuation of consciousness between births, but it would duplicate or cover the territory of other types of non-returner and such a one would be an arahant prior to or upon death so the category would be useless.<br />
					The designation <i>Antarā-parinibbāyissa</i> is here defined as a person who has let go of the self-yokes which would have bound him to the lower sorts of rebirth (defined elsewhere as those realms from the Tusita world down); he has let go those sorts of self-yokings which would have bound him to any sort of rebirth; but has not yet let go of those sorts of self-yokes that would result in personal experience of existence <i>(bhava).</i> Think incorporal observation, or perhaps an identified-with eye otherwise without a body, seeing objects. Having eliminated 'rebirth' from the options available, we have only one reasonable possibility as to the meaning: That subsequent to this individual's death here, but prior to his rebirth anywhere else, he continues to experience, (or there continues to be the experience of) the results of his earlier own-makings <i>(saŋkhāra).</i><br />
					Why do I find this completely reasonable while it drives so many people nutz? Because of the explanation of the definition of existence as given in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15,</a> where it is said that it is only in-so-far-as there is the conjunction of consciousness with named forms that it can be said that there is existence for a thing. Such a one's prior <i>saŋkhāraɱ</i>ing was the joining together of consciousness with named-forms; the result is identified-with consciousness of named forms. The results of earlier <i>saŋkhāraɱ</i>ing are <i>kamma</i> which must be experienced (worked out). When the rest of the individuality has 'served its time', the body goes. When the individuality breaks up at death, if the mind isn't ready yet, consciousness of existing named-forms continues on. At a later point, 'all this' becomes cool, and such a one has attained Arahantship. It is because our 'science' cannot conceive of anything outside existence (e.g., pre-existence, post-existence, extra-sensory existence, potential existence, coming into being, etc.) that there is so much resistance to this idea.<br />
					Finally, the idea that this sutta does not spell out a clear progression of ideas describing the advantages of letting go of the self-yokes: The streamwinner who comes back but once; the streamwinner who goes in a steady line from here to the end; the streamwinner who is almost an arahant, but has some own-makings lagging behind, and the arahant in this visible world ... is hard to believe.</p>

W. Rhys Davids and William Stede. This is a .TXT file. It is intended for use as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two versions:<br />
					1. <a href="../../resources/zip/pts/ped/ped.utf8.zip">ped.utf8.zip</a> For programs that recognize unix line endings; (works in Wordpad) and<br />
					2. <a href="../../resources/zip/pts/ped/ped.utf8_pcln.zip">Ped.utf8.pcln.zip</a> for Notepad and if all you see using #1 is a mass of run-in lines.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. Download the zip file, expand and place the .txt file in some convenient location.</p>

					<div class="floatl 48wpx">
					<p><img src="../../resources/images/ped.ico" width="48" height="48" alt="PED ICON" title="PED ICON" /></p>
					</div>

					<p class="f4">2. Create a shortcut on your desktop. You can copy this image and use it for your icon: </p>

					<p class="f4">3. Opening this file will bring up your default Text Editor. If you are going to do extensive work on Pali documents, I suggest you get a copy of <a href="https://www.textpad.com/index.html">TextPad,</a> (not a paid recommendation! I have been using this editor since the late 1990s; all the pages on this site have been hand coded using it) as it has numerous features (including a unicode character entry tool) which make Pali-Text-Editing life relatively simple.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. You will then be able to copy and paste words selected from unicode encoded files on this site (all files here are now unicode encoded) and using the search or find tool in the editor, you can quickly look up Pali terms. In Textpad, but not in Notepad and Wordpad, lookup (find/search) can be set to "use regular expression" and by placing a '^' befor the word, it will bring you directly to the entry for that word; otherwise it will bring you to successive instances of the word ... you will eventually get to the entry! Random searches are useful for finding variations in the use of the term relative to other terms. Alternatively capitalization will usually result in you being pointed to the entry.</p>

					<p class="f4">This document is the basis of a future dictionary which will not likely come into existence in my lifetime. Meanwhile if you can manage miscellaneous stupid errors, I am continuously correcting this file (it began life as a mangled OCR conversion) and as it stands is the easiest way I have found to quickly look up terms. The Dictionary is also a really good way to find suttas you are looking for. This tool, in any case, beats hands down the tool at the U. of Chicago.</p>

					<p class="f4">This will not work with numerical character entities found on some source files (e.g.: ATI), but will work copying the html output from such.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.utf8.txt">Preview in Browser.</a> You can use this tool from the Firefox browser by clicking the 'Open Menu' &gt; Find in this Page. If you click 'Match Case' you will 'most likely' be brought to the entry for the word. A similar but less sophisticated process is available in Chrome. A similar and sligltly better process is available in I.E (note settings change required; see above).</p>

					<p class="f4">Finally, use this tool in conjunction with the Genovation Macro Keypad discussed <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/df_toc.htm#genovation">here</a> and 'SNAP FINGERS!' you're a Pāḷi scholar.</p>
