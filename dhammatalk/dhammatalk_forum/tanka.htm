					<h1>The Renga on BuddhaDust</h1>

					<h4 class="ctr">and<br />
					Other Verses of Appreciation</h4>

					<p>Those verses enclosed in boxes are from the Suttas and not in the Tanka style. We'll make this page a collection-place for versus in praise of Gotama the Awake and his Dhamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">There has appeared in Magadha before thee<br />
					An unclean <i>dhamma</i> by impure minds devised.<br />
					Open this door of deathlessness, let them hear<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i> awakened to by the stainless one<br />
					As on a crag on crest of mountain standing<br />
					A man might watch the people far below,<br />
					E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br />
					O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<br />
					Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples<br />
					Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.<br />
					Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br />
					Thou freed from debt! Man of the caravan!<br />
					Walk the world over, let the Blessed One<br />
					Teach <i>Dhamma</i>. They who learn will grow."<br />

					<h1>Tanka</h1>

					<p>The poem "BuddhaDust" that gave inspiration to the original name of this website is in the form of the antecedent to the Haiku called a "Tanka". The Tanka is constructed using five lines with 5,7,5,7, and 7 syllables respectively. The Tanka was originally conceived as a way to praise the Awakened and at one point it took the form of a dialog between poets who linked responses in a form called the Renga. You Awakeners out there inspired to praise Gotama are invited to revive this tradition. This thread on the Forum has now [Monday, February 11, 2013 4:19 AM] become this site's Renga.</p>
