<p class="f4">There is a difference in degree and a huge difference in outcome between the meditation procedure required for clairvoyance, clairaudience and the various magic powers and the procedure for attaining <i>Sammā Samādhi.</i></p>

<p class="f4">This difference in degree has become obscured and the confusion which has resulted is leading many to believe they have attained <i>Sammā Samādhi</i> because they have attained, or partially attained, the various magic powers.</p>

<p class="f4">The procedure for the attaining of the various magic powers can/may lead into the procedure for attaining <i>Sammā Samādhi,</i> but is 'earlier' and goes in the opposite direction — getting rather than letting go.</p>

<p class="f4">Both procedures are described as one sequence in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p128">MN 128</a> where Gotama first advises the Anuruddhas as to attaining the light, clairvoyance and clairaudience, and then describes his recognition that what he was doing at the same time as he was attaining various stages of magic power was also letting go of various mental obstructions. 

What appears to be missing from many people's picture of this situation is the recognition that a transition has taken place when the Buddha goes from attainment of the skills needed for magic powers — </p>

<p class="f4 in2">But at the time<br />
when my concentration is not limited<br />
my vision is boundless,<br />
so with boundless vision<br />
for a whole night<br />
and a whole day<br />
and a whole night and day<br />
I both perceive a boundless light-manifestation<br />
and see a boundless (number of) material shapes.'<br /><span class="f1">—Horner translation</span></p>

<p class="f4">which is happening before his awakening<br />
to the recognition that this procedure has also resulted in his getting rid of various defilements of his mind. — </p>

<p class="f4 in2">When I knew, Anuruddhas, that<br />
doubt,<br />			
lack of proper attention,<br />
sloth and torpor,<br />
consternation,<br />
elation,<br />
distress,<br />
too much energy,<br />
too feeble an energy,<br />
longing,<br />
perception of diversity,<br />
the state of being too intent on material shapes,<br />
was a defilement of the mind,<br />
the defilement of the mind<br />
that is doubt<br />
was got rid of.</p>

<p class="f4">and that he was developing at the same time a process of letting go: first of Vitakka
then of Vicara ... etc. ... more or less the procedure for attaining <i>Sammā Samadhi</i> that is frequently described in the suttas:</p>

<p class="f4 in2">Here, beggars, a beggar<br />
separating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
separating himself from unskillful things,<br />
with thinking,<br />
with pondering<br />
isolation-born pleasurable-enthusiasm<br />
rises up into and<br />
makes a habitat of<br />
The First Knowledge.</p>

<p class="f4 in2">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
a beggar,<br />
dissolving thought and pondering,<br />
internally self-pacified,<br />
become whole-heartedly single minded,<br />
without thinking,<br />
without pondering,<br />
rises up into and<br />
makes a habitat of<br />
The Second Knowledge.</p>

<p class="f4 in2">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
a beggar,<br />
with the vanishing of enthusiasm, and<br />
living detached,<br />
minding,<br />
self-aware, and<br />
pleased,<br />
experiencing in his own body<br />
that of which the Aristocrats speak<br />
when they say:</p>

<p class="f4 in2"><i>'Detached, minding, he lives pleasantly'</i></p>

<p class="f4 in2">rises up into and makes a habitat of<br />
The Third Knowledge.</p>					

<p class="f4 in2">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />
a beggar,<br />
letting go of pleasures,<br />
letting go of pains,<br />
settling down the antecedent mental ease and mental pain,<br />
without pain, but<br />
without pleasure,<br />
detached,<br />
recollected,<br />
surpassingly pure,<br />
rises up into and makes a habitat of<br />
The Fourth Knowledge.</p>

<p class="f4">The first portion of these instructions to the Anuruddhas in MN 128 can then be equated to "desire for sense pleasures and involvements with unskillful things" while the second portion is an arrival at a going to less and less.</p>

<p class="f4">Before this realization, while having magic powers, he was not yet enlightened; it is only after recognition of the fact that he was letting things go in the process, that he found the path to awakening, later to be called <i>Sammā Samādhi.</i></p>

<p class="f4">It is vital that people understand this! If at death one believes that one has attained the end of rebirth, <i>kamma,</i> pain through getting, then the <i>Nibbāna</i> attained will be a thing attained and a thing attained is a thing that comes to an end. In other words, it is not <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="f4">Grasping after the progress in understanding of one's followers is not the same thing as teaching out of compassion. Grasping after the progress of one's followers is self-directed and when met with a lack of progress can lead the teacher to anger and the use of any means that he thinks will work which can result in methods that are way out of bounds in terms of the manner in which a teacher should be seen to behave. It may look like such a method has resulted in progress, but what it is teaching is going the wrong direction. Setting a bad example. Demonstrating grasping where what is needed for the greater good is the example of the advantages of letting go.</p>

<p class="f4">You're not just teaching one person; you are teaching anyone who has been in contact with anyone who has witnessed this behavior and anyone who has heard of it from anyone who has heard of it from them.</p>

<p class="f4">So now: All Together. These PDF files make a series characterized by emphasis on the suttas while presenting a focus on a particular topic. They are not easy reads; they are meant to be printed out and used as study guides along with the on-line versions and the translations should be compared with the other translations. The repetitions are included and should not be skipped! They are important learning devices. At any point where there is an internal rebellion against reading a repetition one should put it to the side to be read later. It is saying: Slow down!<br />
I'm not telling you what to do, but if you want to get the most out of these works, think through what is presented until you believe you see the point, then give yourself the time to ponder (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>!). But at this point one is not yet done. When the point is understood intellectually, and seen to be useful, then make an effort to see how it operates in your world and make the appropriate adjustments to your behavior.<br />

These suttas have all been slightly revised in order to make them, I hope, a little clearer and to bring them into compliance with the vocabulary of the previous group (SN 12, 1-30). Understanding what these suttas say and then seeing their operation at work in the world is vital to then seeing how important they are to the understanding of not-self and to the way that frees one from perpetual rebirth in <i>saṃsara.</i><br />

<p>Sariputta teaches Wanderers that ask about who causes <i>kammic</i> consequences that it is in all cases contact (here translated literally as 'touch') that results in <i>kammic</i> consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Ānanda remarking on how interesting it is that the whole doctrine could be stated with one phrase like this, when asked to do so, gives a version of the sequence in detail.<br />
Although it is stated in different words by Ānanda, what is being said is that it is because of deliberate intention resulting from ignorance that 'self' is projected into the contact of consciousness with named forms that is then experienced as "I am experiencing". Consequently it is a matter of eliminating the ignorance that propels this projecting of self into such contact that brings pain to an end. So it is here that you can see that what this formula is showing is  personalization, that is, 'own-making'. The formula is not so much showing how an impersonal pain comes about as showing how it is because of the injection of personal identification by way of identification with the intent to create personal experience through thought, word and deed that the result is identified-with pain.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">The Bodhi Mind</h4>

<p class="f4">A Way Down The Middle</p>

<p class="f4">To hold that the Bodhi Mind exists, is the same thing as holding that the self exists, or that the <i>Tathāgata</i> exists after death — it is the eternalist view.<br />
To hold that the Bodhi Mind does not exist is the annhilationist view.</p>

<p class="f4">Avoiding both views, by not taking even one step in either of those two directions, a third way is to be seen: A Way Down The Middle:</p>

<p class="f4">Suttas 4—10 are identical. They tell us  that the previous six Buddhas and Gotama have all gone through the same thought processes in arriving at their vision of the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada,</i> aka "The Middle Way."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="hrctr" />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="f4">The Middle Way is not a way describing moderation. I have said this a few times but it needs repetition. There is plenty nuf moderation in Buddhism, but when 'The Middle Way' is being spoken of it points to the method to use the Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way, or the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> or any of the multiplicity of Ways that constitute the Buddhist method for escape from <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, pain. Restraining the self from going, doing, acting either in a manner indicating approval, liking, or thinking of it as the only way, etc. or in a manner indicating disapproval, dislike, or thinking of it as the only way, etc.</p>

<p class="f4">For example: You have decided to give the Buddhist method a try. You find yourself hearing about the horseless carriage. In stead of forming an opinion about this, you abstain from approval and disapproval and mind your own business. This is the point of <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi,</i> high or consummate or best view. It keeps your opinions out of the picture. Your job, as an explorer of Buddhism, or as a teacher of Buddhism, is the escape from <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, pain, not the way this new technology will affect you or the interests of the world. Your job is not to comment on or have useless opinions about the horseless carriage.  You hear about Henry Ford and John D. Rockefeller. You refrain from writing slanderous second hand hearsay articles about these people (<i>Sammā Sankappa</i> and <i>Sammā Vaca</i>). And on up the list.</p>

<p class="f4">What is the result? You have more time to devote to what is your real business: the study of, or teaching of Buddhism. You do not waste your very very short time here trying to change the world — in the end a useless, fruitless effort. You make fewer enemies. You make no bad <i>kamma</i> and so experience no journey in remorseland because of that. And you see by that a little bit of <i>Nibbāna.</i> You get a little taste of what freedom really means. You may even see the nack and pull yourself entirely free of this mess. That would be called "setting a good example." That is what is in back of your desire to change the world anyway ... or so we can hope.</p>

<p class="f4">I first learned of this book reading ffrank's blog <a href="https://notesonthedhamma.blogspot.com">Notes on the Dhamma</a></p>

<p class="f4">The book is one of the most inspiring books I have read in a long time, beautifully designed and the translation is what I would call "smooth", virtually invisible. The last chapters are not autobiography, but biography, and I wish only that it had ended with the death of Ajaan Jia. I could have lived without the last few pages of the biography that deal with the theoretical position of the <i>bhikkhus</i> of the Forest school.</p>

<p class="f4">In the autobiography, magic powers are discussed openly and in such a way as to make them perfectly believable; and as far as it goes Ajaan Jia describes his practice in detail and step by step. I will refrain from trying to describe this work any further, but it is necessary to say that it is not the product of a completely free mind but it is close enough to think (and we can hope) that, as was predicted by Ajaan Mun, Ajaan Jia could have achieved the final end at his death.</p>

<p class="f4">These two are identical. This sutta often figures in the discussion concerning whether or not the <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for awakening. Here the interesting thing is that a careful reading of the sutta tells us that it is not really the <i>jhānas</i> or the <i>Brahma-viharas,</i> or the formless realms that bring about <i>Nibbāna,</i> but that these must all be seen as made for the sake of (with the intent of creating) identified-with experience, and must be let go.</p>

<p class="f4">He reflects on that<br />
and understands:</p>

<p class="f4">'Here, for sure,<br />
the first knowledge (and the rest of the <i>jhānas,</i> the<i> Brahma-viharas,</i> and the formless realms) is<br />
a higher own-making,<br />
a higher own-intent,<br />
and furthermore<br />
anything that is<br />
higher own-made<br />
higher own-intended<br />
is impermanent<br />
an ending thing.'</p>

<p class="f4">He, taking a stand on that,<br />
arrives at destruction of<br />
the corrupting influences.</p>

<p class="f4">If not arriving at destruction of<br />
the corrupting influences<br />
then with such as your <i>Dhamma-</i>desire,<br />
with such as your <i>Dhamma-</i>delight<br />
with the utter destruction of the<br />
five yokes connected to lower selfhood-birth<br />
he is spontaneously reborn<br />
attaining final <i>Nibbāna</i> there,<br />
not returning to things of this world.</p>

<p class="f4">This, then, householder,<br />
is a teaching,<br />

one who knows and sees,<br />
aristocrat,<br />
Consummately Self-Awakened,<br />					
whereby a beggar,<br />
living without carelessness,<br />

of the not yet totally destroyed<br />
corrupting influences, and<br />
where one who has not reached<br /> 
the ultimate<br />
peace from the yoke<br />
reaches such peace.</p>

<p class="f4">The conclusion is that the <i>Magga</i> is only one of several different paths that lead one to the point where, by eradicating the <i>Āsavas, Nibbāna</i> can be reached by letting that path go. Each individual path separately, or the first <i>jhāna</i> only, or the full set of four, or the other paths or all of them together are all sufficient to bring one to this position. From the viewpoint of the Arahant they will all be seen as equivalants; the differences between them would be seen as constructed to meet the differences in the dispositions of individuals.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">Negative Opposites</h4>

<p class="f4"><i>"Appamādā"</i> it is a good example of the way almost everyone is mistranslating.</p>

<p class="f4">They translate this word as:</p>

<p class="f4">PED: thoughtfulness, carefulness, conscientiousness, watchfulness, vigilance, earnestness, zeal, alertness, care, caution, diligence, heedlessness ...;</p>

<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Bodhi: heedfulness;<br />
Bhikkhu Thanissaro: heedfulness;<br />
Bhikkhu Sujato: diligence;<br />
Woodward: earnestness;<br />
Mrs. Rhys Davids: diligence ... .</p>

<p class="f4">There are probably others but these come easily to hand.</p>

<p class="f4">However the word <i>"pamādā"</i> is thought of, the word <i>"appamādā"</i> means: <b>NOT</b>-that.</p>

<p class="f4">Negative opposites. If you actually care about rebirth and follow what the Buddha taught about how to achieve that you will see that it is a method almost completely dependent on not-doing. (To be precise, the doing which is not-doing that ends doing.) We are not to give up one way of being just to get another way of being. We are not to give up carelessness to get carefulness; we are to give up carelessness period.	NOT<i>-pamādā.</i></p>

<p class="f4">It is not just the same thing. It is not going from one state to another, it is just not going any further with this state.</p>

<p class="f4">There are masses of these negative opposites that are being translated as positive states. It is not unimportant: what we are doing here is trying to end the actions we perform that create further becoming, existence, life. If we get stuck and need help from the sutta translations and they are pointing to a state involving becoming this is something that can be easily overlooked and is a big huge misleading mistake.</p>

<p class="f4">If the Buddha saw fit to use the same word to describe all sorts of pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> and physical pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> using the same word, and if in English we use the same word for both as well, why would it be difficult to translate it with that word?</p>

The First Burning Knowledge.</p>

<p class="f4">"Absorption" cannot be the correct word to use for what is described as "attaining one state by abandoning another." Neither can any term or description of this skill that implies or requires action be appropriate. This is a system built on letting go of everything, that is everything in this world, absolutely everything, absorption is precisely not letting go.</p>

<p class="f4">You start out like everyone else, absorbed by the world. You find a place to be alone and you sit up straight and then take the mind and place it around the area of the mouth.</p>

<p class="f4">That is your center or home base or the starting place of your focus.</p>

<p class="f4">There, then, you experience yourself enjoying sense pleasures and unskillful things.</p>

<p class="f4">At that point (though it may take some time) you let go (that is not doing) of thoughts about and pondering of sense pleasures and unskillful things.</p>

<p class="f4">You are absorbed by a sexual fantasy. You are not absorbed when you let that fantasy go. All the insights you gain in the <i>jhānas</i> are of the same nature: the freedom attained from letting go of something that has the mind absorbed.</p>

<p class="f4">The result is a subtle form of pleasure <i>(sukha)</i> (not being disturbed by thoughts about and pondering of sense pleasures and unskillful things), and you have left, the clear thinking and pondering of your situation (and later, everything else that you question concerning the <i>Dhamma</i>).</p>

<p class="f4">The first thing you encounter then is that it has been your being alone that has given you this pleasure. That is called appreciation (I also call it enthusiasm sometimes. It is of the same nature.) (an early form of <i>pīti</i>).</p>

<p class="f4">That is the first <i>jhāna.</i></p>

<p class="f4">After you have placed the mind <i>(sati-parimukham),</i> nothing there required you to do anything but let go. This is not absorption.</p>

<p class="f4">The same process applies to the next three <i>jhānas.</i> You notice that there is something in your present situation which is disturbing your peace and you let it go.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">The difference between "not-doing" and "doing nothing"</h4>

<p class="f4">To physically understand the difference between "doing nothing" (which, by definition, is a doing, and is, therefore, impossible) and "not-doing" (which is important to the understanding of every phase of the <i>Pāḷi</i> practice, especially for <i>Jhānas,</i> clench your fist using extreme pressure. Hold the fist clenched for a few seconds, until you can focus on the mechanics of what you are doing. Then, without opening the fist or moving a muscle with intention, let go of the tension that is causing the fist to clench. This is not "doing" anything, this is the letting go of (the ending of) the doing that was the clenching. This example, demonstrated through the physical body, applies as well to all forms of grasping: grasping of the body; grasping after sense experience; grasping after perceptions; grasping after the creation of your own world; and grasping after consciousness.</p>

<p class="f4">Similar to the previous sutta. With this and the previous two one can see how the Buddha is taking similar content and tailoring it to the understanding of his different followers at different times. This one ends with the recollection of the Devas in a different form than the previous and the standard, and seems to me to be qualitatively of a higher order. The reason for the change is a mystery to me as it does not seem to be explained by the level of Nandiya's understanding.</p>

I think, however, that they should all be read through and given a good pondering. Further, they should be read along with the previous two. It looks to me as though this was the way suttas were originally memorized. Certainly it explains how a sutta (or what was thought of as the important part of a sutta if #s 1-3 are to be read as one sutta) could be heard throughout a large audience.</p>

<p class="f4">This sutta should be read with the previous one (just below). Although it is not overtly mentioned in the suttas, I believe it is taken as a matter of common knowledge (there, then, not here, now; which points to the fact that they had better vision then than is evident here now) that forming an intent brings about the thing intended. Not always when or how  one would wish, but sooner or later. There is at least one school of Buddhism that uses this wish-fulfiling aspect of thought as the basis of its popularity. This is also similar to the way intent is used by Don Juan, though the function of his having his apprentices go around thinking and saying "Intent!" seems like a joke to me. What is the case here is that Gotama is telling us that forming an intent is not necessary for the purposes and advantages of attaining freedom through knowing and seeing if one is devoted to living according to the Buddhist understanding (skillful) of ethical standards.</p>

<p class="f1">*From <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p1">AN 10.1</a></p>

<p class="f4">The difference here from my translation of AN 10.1 is that I went from translating from the <i>Pāḷi</i> and PED to translating from the <i>Pāḷi,</i> PED and experience — not that I did not have the experience, such as it was at the time, but that I did not closely examine the terms I would use to describe the experience. <i>Sīla</i> can mean "virtues". There is nothing wrong with having virtue, but "virtue" is greatly misused today in that the emphasis is on conduct that would be better headed under morality (conduct approved of as good by the majority, rather than derived from a principle). There is no mention in the <i>Pāḷi</i> of "conduct", but I suppose that can be inferred. One sometimes has remorse from conduct that is not ethically good; sometimes not. What is consistently present in those striving for purity of ethical conduct is the self criticizing the self for breaches of such conduct. I do not see "joy" arising from following skillful ethical standards. What is there when one looks is congratulations or satisfaction with the self or relief from fear of the consequences of breaches. Getting "approval" from <i>"pīti"</i> requires only that one understand this term as encompassing all sorts of liking, from moderate liking to rapture. I do not see rapture there at all, but I also do not think that rapture leads to calm or tranquility. What liking the situation does lead to is being pleased with one's behavior. The difference between "through" and "by", and "knowledge of" comes from what you think this series is about — is it a method to accomplish the goal, or is it a method for seeing the goal as accomplished? The sutta purports to be discussing the purposes and advantages.</p>

<p class="f4">Some Valuable Resources:</p>

<p class="f4"><a href="https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/"><b>Digital <i>Pāḷi</i> Dictionary.</b></a> This links to a page which describes this dictionary and the many features of <b>Golden Dictionary.</b></p>

<p class="f4"><a href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/"><b>Open Buddhist University.</b></a> A huge but very well organized and beautifully presented collection of references to Buddhist works of all sorts.</p>

<p class="f4">The <a href="https://index.readingfaithfully.org/">Index at Reading Faithfully.</a> The site defaults to the translations of <i>Bhikkhu</i> Sujato but these can be ignored and the translations here can be found by just using the sutta id. Links to some other translators such as those of Bhikkhu Anandajoti and Bhikkhu Thanissaro are obtainable there by clicking on the gear icon at the top of the page and selecting "reference helper".</p>

<p class="f4">As expected, the Bhikkhu Sujato translations are now increasingly being used throughout the web. The objection here to these translations is that they reflect the activist Buddhist view. It is not just that important words are mistranslated, but that the entire set is world-oriented. Using the set while changing a few words will not do. While the Buddha freely gives advice to the world-oriented, becoming (living, being, existing) of any sort (as low as the Hells to as high as becoming in the sphere of the ending of perception and experience in the world), any sort of sense-experience, world-orientation, is all considered a lesser, even a failure at achieving the goal in this system. The goal in this system is the escape from sense-experience, <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, pain, but not just wordly pain. It is a hopeless cause, but there may be some who find this world intolerable and really see the point of escape and the efficacy of the Buddha's methods for doing so. To be constantly thrown back into a worldly view by a translation is a very dangerous thing.</p>

<p class="f4">When you get upset because the phone tree goes on forever before giving you the way to reach a live person, your mind is giving you a clue that you have expectations.</p>

<p class="f4">When you have an expectation and things turn out differently than the way you expected, and you get upset, that is a sign, a track of your having some investment in that expectation.</p>

<p class="f4">That is a sign that you think of yourself as occupying a station above the reality.</p>

<p class="f4">When you finally do reach a live person at the end of the phone tree and they do not have the information you were seeking and you take out your feelings of frustration on that person, that is an outward sign or track of the same belief that things should be going the way you think they should be going.</p>

<p class="f4">This is entirely a set-up for upset. Making yourself feel bad. And, for one thing that sign, or track fills the emptiness, and can be seen by those with clear sight as you holding on to that belief. So you have made yourself unhappy and you have given others reason to think you are, at the least, a fool.</p>

<p class="f4">Do not think you cannot be seen!</p>

<p class="f4">Then, when things do go your way, that delight you feel is just as much a sign of this same sort of belief system and has the same implications and gives the same information to anyone who wishes to know it.</p>

<p class="f4">One more thing: With expectations and reactions of liking and disliking the way things really are is obscured. You do not see the story the way it is really unfolding. You are missing one of the greatest joys of this life. That is another way of saying you are blind. To live without expectations, to be satisfied with things the way they are, is to see. And to see is to enjoy.</p>

<p class="f4">Just saying. Be mindful and get rid of those expectations!</p>

<p class="f4">Here and there on the internet we find objections to the use by the Buddha of what is thought to be the harsh handling of fools, by the calling of them "fools" by the Buddha. This is really a mis-hearing of the tone of this term by those individuals. It is heard relative to the context. Those guilty of silly thinking will not feel the impact of being called a fool as deeply as those guilty of offences that will result in great unhappiness to many.
As readers many centuries later we should rather think that the intent here was to shake up the person addressed. Get him to realize the seriousness of his offence. But, if the reader finds it difficult to believe that the Buddha would address foolish individuals as "foolish" or "fools", he should look to the origin of this term in <i>Pāḷi</i> (PED) where the word is actually "childish" or "young" with the meaning of the lack of understanding of the child or youth.</p>

<p class="f4">As for the use of this term on this site, it is done with the following ideas in mind:<br />
it is rendered harmless today in that it is not directed at any living person;<br />
it is used because today the pair "wise man" and "fool" are the usages in practice;<br />
it is used because any person today that has intentions or thinks thoughts or speaks words or does acts that produce unpleasantness is a fool;<br />
it is used because such an individual is not a real person, that is in reality such a one is a mindless robot that intentionally (even if not his own intentions) inflicts the unpleasant on others.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">What Language is the <i>Pāḷi?</i></h4>

<p class="f4">There is a lot of steam and paper wasted in the effort to prove one theory or another as to what exactly <i>Pāḷi</i> is as a language and what language the Buddha actually used. I think a more productive way to deal with this issue is to let it go.</p>

<p class="f4">Let what was said in the <i>Pāḷi</i> be what the Buddha said in his own words and forget looking for the "real" language he may have spoken or where <i>Pāḷi</i> might have come from. The place it came from doesn't exist! And except as a waste of time, it doesn't matter. What we have in the suttas as we have them, even in translation, will get you out of this mess if you take the time to understand what was said there.</p>

<p class="f4">The most reasonable way to think of this is the same way that today and yesterday and the day before that any writer worth his salt has used his own language, and it is really his own invention applicable to his works alone.</p>

<p class="f4">What that is is the language he grew up with, the language he has heard around him, the language he heard his parents and grandparents and great-grandparents use and that was the language they heard spoken by their parents and grandparents and great grandparents back seven generations or more. And it is what he invents at the time to convey his ideas.</p>

<p class="f4">What we see as his writing is going to have scraps from way back and from other languages and (especially in the case of a seer like Gotama) it will have an influence on the way language is used way into the future.</p>

<p class="f4">We can see that even in translation the <i>Pāḷi</i> is influencing the way English (and almost every other language) is being used today ... just take a look at the way the people are writing on the forums. You try to pin-point the one language this work came from you are barking up the wrong tree and you are distracting people! That is not a good thing.</p>

<p class="f4">You think there is no bad <i>kamma</i> comes with making a big thing of this study, you have another think coming.</p>

<p class="f4">Work on this website is basically done to the point of sufficiency for those interested in the study and practice of Buddhism. What you get from here is extra. Things that may be helpful, but are not essential to understanding. Corrections to errors will continue to be made.</p>

<p class="f4">The site was among the first dealing with the Buddhism found in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and had the idea of getting <i>something</i> helpful out there which others could work with and improve upon. The result was too much haste and the result of that was a super-sufficiency of typographical and spelling errors. For some time now it has been the effort here to rid the site of those errors, but many remain. Errors in doctrine are a matter of opinion and one of the purposes of the site was to provide a multiplicity of views on these matters. In recent times the number of differing opinions concerning doctrine has the appearance of having multiplied, but a careful reading will show that virtually all of these are sub-doctrines of those dealt with earlier.</p>

<p class="f4">Among the things that are being done in the very relaxed post-sufficiency way is adding italics to the foreign words of the <i>Pāḷi</i> dictionary found <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm">here</a>. I am updating this file only haphazardly.</p>

<p class="f4">Doing this has necessitated reading the entries very closely and that has brought to my attention a lot of errors, some dating back as far as the original scanning, many introduced by my clumsy handling of regular expressions. <i>"Pali"</i> may have been converted to <i>"Pāḷi",</i> many commas "," may have been seen in the original scanning as periods "."; a massive regular expression error was the joining of "a" to the following word (e.g. "a house" became "ahouse"; and again I think in the original scan, some words have been broken up, as in "mo tion" for "motion."</p>

<p class="f4">I am, of course, correcting those errors as I find them, but the reader should be aware that this is a flawed work. There are now several <i>Pāḷi</i>/English dictionaries available in digital form, and several programs that allow one to find the English term used to translate the <i>Pāḷi</i> which, of course, just confirms the translation being used. I have not seen any dictionary or translation tool that is quite as complete as this version and I continue to use it almost every day because it provides word-history and relationships and allows choice by giving possible alternative meanings.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">Faith and Its Connection to Stream-Winning</h4>

<p class="f4">For the person who in the world,<br />
attached to,<br />
in bondage to,<br />
having greed for,<br />
being overtaken by<br />
lust for sense-pleasures;<br />
attached to,<br />
in bondage to,<br />
having greed for,<br />
being overtaken by<br />
lust for points of view,<br />
it is impossible to see,<br />
the existence of any other person.</p>

<p class="f4">This is not saying that belief in others is impossible,<br />
indeed, it is not only not impossible,<br />
it is usually the case,<br />
but that case is a matter of belief,<br />
it is not something that has actually been seen.</p>

<p class="f4">Seeing without resort to sensory perception is the difference that makes a person a Streamwinner-in-fact as opposed to the Streamwinner by belief.</p>

<p class="f4">The Streamwinner-in-fact does not slip back; the Streamwinner-by-belief becomes a Streamwinner-in-fact if he hangs on, but is subject to the possibility of slipping out of his belief.</p>

<p class="f4">Seeing without resort to perception through the senses is accomplished by a person when they see the problem of endlessly recycling rebirths in <i>saṃsara</i> and can see that this problem is solved by the idea that there is no thing there that is the self and that all sensory perception of the world as an existing thing can therefore be brought to an end.</p>

<p class="f4">Before this is seen the idea that someone out there has actually accomplished the deed is essential; seeing this as the solution to that problem is seeing that someone has actually accomplished the deed. This is faith in the Awakening of the Buddha.</p>

<p class="f4">This is seeing that this knowledge is the method that will bring the endless cycle of rebirths to an end. This is faith in the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

<p class="f4">Seeing what needs to be done is half the problem, the rest is accomplishing it. This is done by the step-by-step letting go of any identification (seeing anything as the self or as belonging to the self) with the entire existing world and the not-doing of any deed that extends identification with the existence of the world. Seeing that this is a gradual process is seeing the four basic stages: Streamwinning, Once Returning, Non-Returning, and Arahantship and the enjoyment, release in freedom, that follows such attainment. This is faith in the <i>Saṇgha.</i></p>

<p class="f4">The step-by-step letting go of any identification with the entire existing world and the not-doing of any deed that extends identification with the existence of the world is accomplished by the application to the existing being of the steps found in the Way:</p>

<p class="f4">Consummate point of view — this is all essentially pain, this pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> is a result of wanting, this pain <b><i>[DUKKHA]</i></b> is ended by ending the wanting, and this is the way to do all that — as a working hypothesis;</p>

<h4 class="ctr">Honoring The Teacher<br />
The One That Has Shown the Way</h4>

<p class="f4">All that which is perceived through the senses has come to be and comes to an end.</p>

<p class="f4">Locked into, identified with, perception through the senses, one is subject to, is not able to escape from, the coming to be and the destruction of all that which is perceived through the senses.</p>

<p class="f4">A visible object coming into contact with the eye is perceived by the individual identifying with perception through the senses through the consciousness of it in the mind of the perceiver. There is no direct perception of the visible object there.</p>

<p class="f4">In the same way, that is the same thing as saying: "Everything perceived is perceived as created by the self." There is no escape in Death. Rebirth is just the repetition of the same old problem. Endlessly.</p>

<p class="f4">This results, for one who sees the danger of this, for one who is fed-up with this, is the desire to escape the coming to be of perception through the senses.</p>

<p class="f4">The result of this is to see that faith in the <i>Dhamma, Saṇghā,</i> training, serenity, non-carelessness, and the willingness to give the method claimed by the Buddha to gain escape a shot is completely dependent on faith that this person has in fact found a way to escape identification with the coming to be of perception through the senses.</p>

<p class="f4">How does one establish such faith?</p>

<p class="f4">One begins with blind faith coupled with the working hypothesis that such a one did exist and correctly laid out the method for others who followed that path to achieve the same goal.</p>

<p class="f4">Here that path is described as:</p>

<p class="f4">1. <i>Paṭisanthāra.</i> Translated by Hare as "Good Will"; by <i><i>bhikkhu</i></i> Bodhi (his <span class="f1">AN.7#70</span>) as hospitality. I would say, rather, that it was being willing to give this method a shot.</p>

<p class="f4">2. Being so willing one acts without carelessness in following the directions found in the method.</p>

<p class="f4">3. Being without carelessness one is undisturbed, that is, serene. In the serene state things are clear.</p>

<p class="f4">4. Being serene one does not rebel against details of the training and one becomes trained and sees for the self the advantages of being trained.</p>

<p class="f4">5. Seeing these advantages, one sees the various stages that will be reached by one who follows the method. This is seeing the <i>Saṇghā.</i> The importance of seeing the <i>Saṇghā</i> is that so seeing one sees that others who have followed this method will have arrived at various stages within it right up to attaining the goal of complete escape from sensory perception ever after.</p>

<p class="f4">With this insight being a personal experience one is able to place confidence in the advantages in freedom of conformity with the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

<p class="f4">Following the method in this way one achieves the goal and in this achievement one no longer depends on trust in the fact that the Buddha has found a way to escape identification with the coming to be of perception through the senses and the destruction that follows. One has seen this as a matter of personal experience.</p>

<p class="f4">In this way one respects or honors the Consummately Awakened One.</p>

<p class="f4"><i>A-dukkha-m-a-sukhā vedanā,</i> not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant experience, is not "neutral" feeling. This term is a name for the repercussion experienced by a wise person intending to escape <i>kamma.</i> When accompanied by blindness it results in the urge to experience pleasant sense-experience. When accompanied by wisdom it is a taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

<p class="f4">If this repercussion were some sort of sense-experience, there would be no escaping <i>kamma.</i> This is the experience of not experiencing sense-experience that is either painful or pleasant.</p>

<h4 class="ctr"><i>Viññāṇā</i></h4>

<p class="f4">I think we should be using the literal translation of this term: "Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge".</p>

<p class="f4">"Consciousness", the usual translation, is causing us great confusion because <i>"viññāṇā"</i> is used to describe both the state of sense-consciosness of the ordinary sense-bound individual and the state of the freed consciousness of the Arahant.</p>

<p class="f4">The careful reader will see my struggles to get this clear throughout the site. <i><i>bhikkhu</i>s</i> Thanissaro and Bodhi have also had problems with this term which they have handled each differently according to their thinking.</p>

<p class="f4">Sometimes "consciousness" will be used by me for both states; sometimes "consciousness" will be used only when describing the state of the Arahant and "sense-consciousness" will be being used for the ordinary person; sometimes "individualized-consciousness" will be used to describe the state of the ordinary person. None of these alternatives really reflect what is found in the <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

<p class="f4">If we used, instead, "re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" that could be used for both cases as <i>"viññāṇā"</i> is used in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and with this translation it would not be causing the confusion it is now causing.</p>

<p class="f4">"Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" means simply having knowledge of knowing <b>whatever</b> has arisen as a consequence of perception. (There is perception beyond sense-experience. See: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_11_ekadasakanipata.htm#p7">AN 11.7</a> and many others)</p>

<p class="f4">If the perception is of named-forms, or the sense realms then it is re-knowing-knowledge of sense-experience; if the perception is of freedom from perception of named-forms or the sense realms then it is re-knowing-knowledge of freedom.</p>

<p class="f4"><i>Saññā</i></p>

<p class="f4">Sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, ideas.</p>

<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā</i></p>

<p class="f4">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking.</p>

<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā</i></p>

<p class="f4">Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge of that.</p>

<p class="f4">Blind to how that ends,<br />
the arising of identification with the intent to get sense-experience through acts of body, speech and mind,<br />
with the arising of such own-making,<br />
the arising of named-forms<br />
with the arising of named-forms,<br />

<p class="f4">Such is the result of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of things experienced through the senses.</p>

<p class="f4"><i>Saññā</i></p>

<p class="f4">But if the perception is:</p>

<p class="f4">This is it!<br />
This is the culmination!<br />
That is, the calming of all own-making,<br />
the resolution of all involvements,<br />

<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā</i></p>

<p class="f4">the experience will be:</p>

<p class="f4">Lived has been the best of lives!<br />

No further is there this side or that.<br />
No more being any kind of an "it"<br />
at any place of "atness" for me."</p>

<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā</i></p>

<p class="f4">and the re-knowing-knowledge will be:</p>

<p class="f4">Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge of<br />
seeing that how that ends,<br />
there is no arising of identification with the intent to get sense-experience through acts of body, speech and mind,<br />
that when there is no arising of such own-making,<br />
there is no arising of named-forms<br />
that when there is no arising of named-forms,<br />
there is no arising of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of that,<br />

there is no arising of birth,<br />
when there is no arising of birth,<br />
there is no arising of aging, sickness, and death,<br />
grief and lamentation,<br />
pain and misery, and<br />
despair.</p>

<p class="f4">Such is the result of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of freedom from things experienced through the senses.</p>

<p class="f4">There is now little point in my making a change like this (in fact, if the difference is kept in mind, it might even be useful as the idea is understood as "consciousness" today anyway) so readers are advised to make the connection in their minds as they go along:  there is consciousness experienced through the senses and there is consciousness apart from the senses. That which is experienced through the senses is said to exist and to have been own-made and therefore comes to an end in pain. That which is apart from experience through the senses is not said to exist and has not been own-made and because of that does not come to and end or bring about the experience of pain.</p>

<p class="f4">"Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" was the translation first used here, I should have stuck with that, but peer pressure caused me to revert to "consciousness". It has been a confusing, debilitating, blind obstruction ever since.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">The Cloying Nature of Food</h4>

<p class="f4">"Cloying" appears quite often in the translations of the suttas and however 'ancient' it may be, is a perfect description of the problem food creates for the student of the <i>Dhamma.</i> One seeking to properly set up the mind should make himself conscious of the cloying nature of food. I think a definition is useful.</p>

<p class="f4">To cloy is to create disgust by way of first creating thirst for enjoyment resulting in over-indulgence.</p>

<p class="f4">From the OED: Possibly from to claw, or scratch.<br />
The first six meanings relate to problems created by nails.<br />

<h4 class="ctr">Temporary Freedom</h4>

<p class="f4 ctr"><b>Freedom from Things of Time<br />
Every Once in a While</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="f4">The first term to understand in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p149">AN 5.149</a> is <i>'samaya,' sam</i> or <i>sa + m</i> = 'on' or 'with' aya: time, age, while. The 'Once upon a Time' or 'at one time' or 'once' of <i>Nidana's.</i> Temporal release; not temporary release; although the subject of the sutta is temporary release. Once in a while. The contemporary Indian English: 'Once in a way.' <i>vimutti</i> = freedom. The thing itself is having let go of some attachment, after the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms have passed off, reflecting on the bondage one had to a past habit one experiences a sense of freedom. This is often a matter of a profound sense of freedom accompanied by a 'sigh of relief.' If this is carefully examined, it is seen to be the whole process of attaining Arahantship in a nutshell.</p>

<p class="f4">This careful examination includes, as well as a reflection on the things that lead to falling away from that state (delight in activity, gab, sleep and company, and, in the next sutta, <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/05_fives/an05.150.olds.bd.htm">AN 5.150,</a> not guarding the experiences at the senses and immoderate eating) not reflecting on the freedom of heart one has gained.</p>

<p class="f4">That last is:  <i>"athā-vimuttaṃ cittaṃ na pacc'avekkhati."</i><br />
My translation: "... he does not reflect on the freedom of heart he has attained."<br />
Hare: "he does not look at the mind apart"<br />
Which he footnotes: "... our Comy. 'just in momentary flashes' (<i>appit'appita-khaṇe, appeti</i> means both to fix and to rush on) 'with the depravities discarded, there is a state of release' ..."<br />
<i><i>bhikkhu</i></i> Bodhi (not among the freely released suttas): "... he does not review the extent to which the mind is liberated." He gives this note: "Mp.: 'One who is liberated in mind through a mundane liberation, a tentative liberation, through the suppression of the defilements in absorption.'" (I object to the idea of 'suppression'. Suppression is the forcing down of a thing which requires continuous contact whereas what is involved here is separation. Mundane here is also not realistic, this is a major accomplishment, next door to <i>Nibbāna,</i> and is directly on the path.</p>

<p class="f4">What has happened is that one has attained what is called "freedom from things of Time." This means freedom from any thing that has a beginning, middle, and end. It is temporary because  the freedom so attained is focused on this world or on one or another of the things of this world. The problem described here, not reflecting on the mind apart (Hare's translation focuses on an important way of seeing this), is solved, and lasting freedom attained when, in stead of focusing on some worldly object, one focuses in stead on the freedom attained. This is reflecting on the mind as a thing apart from the things of this world.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">Unable to Arise Again in the Future</h4>

<p class="f4">This is not the one-dimensional thing that is restraint. This is when one has gone up a level or more so that a bad thing is not even seen. "This indicates that such and such a bad thing would arise if going that way." For example, one is tempted to go down a certain street but one knows that going that way one will see the fairest lass of the land which will result in lust arising, so one does not go that way and one avoids the arising lust. With repeated practice and habit the not going that way becomes automatic and is unaccompanied even by trepidation. With more practice and a clearer picture of things as they really are, the lust will not arise even when confronted with such a stimulus because one's mind is on something else altogether. One or more steps removed. A thing which gives one time and distance from a bad situation eventually to the point where whatever the stimulus the distance between that and the arising of some bad state will always produce detachment.</p>

<h4 class="ctr">Authenticity</h4>

<p class="f4">If you do not understand rebirth, you do not really have a grasp of the point of Buddhism or the meaning of pain. If you understand these things then you can see that this business of authenticity has been used in these times as a way of not facing the work involved in bringing this system into your life. The whole of this research called "modern linguistic analysis", EBT (Early Buddhist Texts), "stratification", etc., is invalidated with the idea that a person, maybe hundreds or thousands of years after the Buddha's death might remember a saying that was not recorded in the sutta collections. Comparing sutta with sutta means that one is to take the <i>Dhamma,</i> the instructions or advice as to how to achieve <i>Nibbāna</i> or some other good state, or as to how to eliminate some bad state, and to compare that message and its construction with those suttas that are in the already-formed collection. What lines up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be accepted; what does not line up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be put to the side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="ctr"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not the Bodhi Mind</h4>

<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not an existing thing outside there waiting for you to attain it. This is something that is very difficult to see for the translators. Almost all of them (including Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi) have settled for this existing thing and that is making them, essentially, into Mahāyana Buddhists discovering or reaching a Bodhi Mind.</p>

<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> comes into being for the individual. It is conditioned by the following of the <i>Magga,</i> but it is not own-made <i>(saṇkhāraed).</i></p>

<p class="f4">Following the <i>Magga</i> is a path of not-doings. Not doing this or that, the thing that results is not-done, not <i>saṇkhāred.</i> Following the <i>Magga, Nibbāna</i> is <b>born,</b> but is not "made by the individual". [Edit: that is probably not a very good way to put that in that <i>Nibbāna</i> is said to be the "unborn". Better would be "Following the <i>Magga,</i> the <b>path</b> to <i>Nibbāna</i> is born." What is intended is not that <i>Nibbāna</i> comes into existence per the Buddha's definition of an existing thing ((see DN 15) consciousness of named form), but that the path to the unborn is now born in the individual.]</p>

<p class="f4">In <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p57">AN 5.57,</a> a parallel construction is put this way but the  connection between "the path" and <i>Nibbāna:</i> is not made by the translators.</p>

<p class="f4">When one often reflects on being subject to aging, sickness, death, separation from the loved, and being the owner of one's <i>kamma,</i> the path comes into existence."</p>

<p class="f4">Bhk. Thanissaro:</p>

<p class="f4">When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth.</p>

<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi:</p>

<p class="f4">"As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated."</p>

<p class="f4">E.M. Hare:</p>

<p class="f4">"And while he often contemplates this thing, the Way comes into being"</p>

<p class="f4">Take birth. The path is generated. Comes into being. Not "is reached," "is discovered."</p>
