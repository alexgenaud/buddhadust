					<h4 class="ctr">Authenticity</h4>

					<p class="f4">If you do not understand rebirth, you do not really have a grasp of the point of Buddhism or the meaning of pain. If you understand these things then you can see that this business of authenticity has been used in these times as a way of not facing the work involved in bringing this system into your life. The whole of this research called "modern linguistic analysis", EBT (Early Buddhist Texts), "stratification", etc., is invalidated with the idea that a person, maybe hundreds or thousands of years after the Buddha's death might remember a saying that was not recorded in the sutta collections. Comparing sutta with sutta means that one is to take the <i>Dhamma,</i> the instructions or advice as to how to achieve <i>Nibbāna</i> or some other good state, or as to how to eliminate some bad state, and to compare that message and its construction with those suttas that are in the already-formed collection. What lines up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be accepted; what does not line up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be put to the side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not the Bodhi Mind</h4>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not an existing thing outside there waiting for you to attain it. This is something that is very difficult to see for the translators. Almost all of them (including Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi) have settled for this existing thing and that is making them, essentially, into Mahāyana Buddhists discovering or reaching a Bodhi Mind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> comes into being for the individual. It is conditioned by the following of the <i>Magga,</i> but it is not own-made <i>(saṇkhāraed).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Following the <i>Magga</i> is a path of not-doings. Not doing this or that, the thing that results is not-done, not <i>saṇkhāred.</i> Following the <i>Magga, Nibbāna</i> is <b>born,</b> but is not "made by the individual".</p>

					<p class="f4">In <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p57">AN 5.57,</a> a parallel construction is put this way but the  connection between "the path" and <i>Nibbāna:</i> is not made by the translators.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one often reflects on being subject to aging, sickness, death, separation from the loved, and being the owner of one's <i>kamma,</i> the path comes into existence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Thanissaro:</p>

					<p class="f4">When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated."</p>

					<p class="f4">E.M. Hare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And while he often contemplates this thing, the Way comes into being"</p>

					<p class="f4">Take birth. The path is generated. Comes into being. Not "is reached," "is discovered."</p>
