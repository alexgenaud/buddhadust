					<h4 class="ctr">Honoring The Teacher<br />
					The One That Has Shown the Way</h4>

					<p class="f4">All that which is perceived through the senses has come to be and comes to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Locked into, identified with, perception through the senses, one is subject to, is not able to escape from, the coming to be and the destruction of all that which is perceived through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">A visible object coming into contact with the eye is perceived by the individual identifying with perception through the senses through the consciousness of it in the mind of the perceiver. There is no direct perception of the visible object there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, that is the same thing as saying: "Everything perceived is perceived as created by the self." There is no escape in Death. Rebirth is just the repetition of the same old problem. Endlessly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This results, for one who sees the danger of this, for one who is fed-up with this, in the desire to escape the coming to be of perception through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">The result of this is to see that faith in the <i>Dhamma, Saṇghā,</i> training, serenity, non-carelessness, and the willingness to give the method claimed by the Buddha to gain escape a shot is completely dependent on faith that this person has in fact found a way to escape identification with the coming to be of perception through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does one establish such faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">One begins with blind faith coupled with the working hypothesis that such a one did exist and correctly laid out the method for others who followed that path to achieve the same goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here that path is described as:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <i>Paṭisanthāra.</i> Translated by Hare as "Good Will"; by <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi (his <span class="f1">AN.7#70</span>) as hospitality. I would say, rather, that it was being willing to give this method a shot.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Being so willing one acts without carelessness in following the directions found in the method.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Being without carelessness one is undisturbed, that is, serene. In the serene state things are clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Being serene one does not rebel against details of the training and one becomes trained and sees for the self the advantages of being trained.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Seeing these advantages, one sees the various stages that will be reached by one who follows the method. This is seeing the <i>Saṇghā.</i> The importance of seeing the <i>Saṇghā</i> is that so seeing one sees that others who have followed this method will have arrived at various stages within it right up to attaining the goal of complete escape from sensory perception ever after.</p>

					<p class="f4">With this insight being a personal experience one is able to place confidence in the advantages in freedom of conformity with the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Following the method in this way one achieves the goal and in this achievement one no longer depends on trust in the fact that the Buddha has found a way to escape identification with the coming to be of perception through the senses and the destruction that follows. One has seen this as a matter of personal experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way one respects or honors the Consummately Awakened One.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>A-Dukkha-m-A-Sukhā Vedanā</i></h4>

					<p class="f4"><i>A-dukkha-m-a-sukhā vedanā,</i> not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant sense experience, is not "neutral" feeling. This term is a name for the repercussion experienced by a wise person intending to escape <i>kamma.</i> When accompanied by blindness it results in the urge to experience pleasant sense-experience. When accompanied by wisdom it is a taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If this repercussion were some sort of sense-experience, there would be no escaping <i>kamma.</i> This is the experience of not experiencing sense-experience that is either painful or pleasant.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>Viññāṇā</i></h4>

					<p class="f4">I think we should be using the literal translation of this term: "Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge".</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness", the usual translation, is causing us great confusion because <i>"viññāṇā"</i> is used to describe both the state of sense-consciosness of the ordinary sense-bound individual and the state of the freed consciousness of the Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">The careful reader will see my struggles to get this clear throughout the site. <i>Bhikkhus</i> Thanissaro and Bodhi have also had problems with this term which they have handled each differently according to their thinking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sometimes "consciousness" will be used by me for both states; sometimes "consciousness" will be used only when describing the state of the Arahant and "sense-consciousness" will be being used for the ordinary person; sometimes "individualized-consciousness" will be used to describe the state of the ordinary person. None of these alternatives really reflect what is found in the <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If we used, instead, "re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" that could be used for both cases as <i>"viññāṇā"</i> is used in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and with this translation it would not be causing the confusion it is now causing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" means simply having knowledge of knowing <b>whatever</b> has arisen as a consequence of perception. (There is perception beyond sense-experience. See: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_11_ekadasakanipata.htm#p7">AN 11.7</a> and many others)</p>

					<p class="f4">If the perception is of named-forms, or the sense realms then it is re-knowing-knowledge of sense-experience; if the perception is of freedom from perception of named-forms or the sense realms then it is re-knowing-knowledge of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Saññā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Sights, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blind to how that ends,<br />
					the arising of identification with the intent to get sense-experience through acts of body, speech and mind,<br />
					with the arising of such own-making,<br />
					the arising of named-forms<br />
					with the arising of named-forms,<br />

					despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of things experienced through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Saññā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">But if the perception is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is it!<br />
					This is the culmination!<br />
					That is, the calming of all own-making,<br />
					the resolution of all involvements,<br />
					the withering away of thirst,<br />
					dispassion,<br />
					extinction,<br />
					Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">the experience will be:</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived has been the best of lives!<br />
					Done is duty's doing!<br />
					No further is there this side or that.<br />
					No more being any kind of an "it"<br />
					at any place of "atness" for me."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Viññāṇā</i></p>

					<p class="f4">and the re-knowing-knowledge will be:</p>

					<p class="f4">Re-knowng-knowing-knowledge of<br />
					seeing that how that ends,<br />
					there is no arising of identification with the intent to get sense-experience through acts of body, speech and mind,<br />
					that when there is no arising of such own-making,<br />
					there is no arising of named-forms<br />
					that when there is no arising of named-forms,<br />
					there is no arising of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of that,<br />
					that when there is no arising of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of that,<br />
					there is no arising of the six realms of sense,<br />
					that when there is no arising of the six realms of sense,<br />
					there is no arising of contact,<br />
					that when there is no arising of contact,<br />
					there is no arising of sense-experience,<br />

					there is no arising of thirst,<br />
					that when there is no arising of thirst,<br />
					there is no arising of involvement with the effort to get or get away from,<br />
					that when there is no arising of such involvement,<br />
					there is no arising of becoming,<br />
					that when there is no arising of becoming,<br />
					there is no arising of birth,<br />
					when there is no arising of birth,<br />
					there is no arising of aging, sickness, and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery, and<br />
					despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of freedom from things experienced through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is now little point in my making a change like this (in fact, if the difference is kept in mind, it might even be useful as the idea is understood as "consciousness" today anyway) so readers are advised to make the connection in their minds as they go along:  there is consciousness experienced through the senses and there is consciousness apart from the senses. That which is experienced through the senses is said to exist and to have been own-made and therefore comes to an end in pain. That which is apart from experience through the senses is not said to exist and has not been own-made and because of that does not come to and end or bring about the experience of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge" was the translation first used here, I should have stuck with that, but peer pressure caused me to revert to "consciousness". It has been a confusing, debilitating, blind obstruction ever since.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The Cloying Nature of Food</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Cloying" appears quite often in the translations of the suttas and however 'ancient' it may be, is a perfect description of the problem food creates for the student of the <i>Dhamma.</i> One seeking to properly set up the mind should make himself conscious of the cloying nature of food. I think a definition is useful.</p>

					<p class="f4">To cloy is to create disgust by way of first creating thirst for enjoyment resulting in over-indulgence.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the OED: Possibly from to claw, or scratch.<br />
					The first six meanings relate to problems created by nails.<br />
					Meaning 7: To overload with food, so as to cause loathing, to surfeit or satiate (with over-feeding) or with richness, sweetness, or sameness of food);<br />
					8: To satiate, surfeit, gratify beyond desire; to  disgust, weary (with excess of anything.)</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Temporary Freedom</h4>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>Freedom from Things of Time<br />
					Every Once in a While</b></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The first term to understand in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p149">AN 5.149</a> is <i>'samaya,' sam</i> or <i>sa + m</i> = 'on' or 'with' aya: time, age, while. The 'Once upon a Time' or 'at one time' or 'once' of <i>Nidana's.</i> Temporal release; not temporary release; although the subject of the sutta is temporary release. Once in a while. The contemporary Indian English: 'Once in a way.' <i>vimutti</i> = freedom. The thing itself is having let go of some attachment, after the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms have passed off, reflecting on the bondage one had to a past habit one experiences a sense of freedom. This is often a matter of a profound sense of freedom accompanied by a 'sigh of relief.' If this is carefully examined, it is seen to be the whole process of attaining Arahantship in a nutshell.</p>

					<p class="f4">This careful examination includes, as well as a reflection on the things that lead to falling away from that state (delight in activity, gab, sleep and company, and, in the next sutta, <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/05_fives/an05.150.olds.bd.htm">AN 5.150,</a> not guarding the experiences at the senses and immoderate eating) not reflecting on the freedom of heart one has gained.</p>

					<p class="f4">That last is:  <i>"athā-vimuttaṃ cittaṃ na pacc'avekkhati."</i><br />
					My translation: "... he does not reflect on the freedom of heart he has attained."<br />
					Hare: "he does not look at the mind apart"<br />
					Which he footnotes: "... our Comy. 'just in momentary flashes' (<i>appit'appita-khaṇe, appeti</i> means both to fix and to rush on) 'with the depravities discarded, there is a state of release' ..."<br />
					<i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi (not among the freely released suttas): "... he does not review the extent to which the mind is liberated." He gives this note: "Mp.: 'One who is liberated in mind through a mundane liberation, a tentative liberation, through the suppression of the defilements in absorption.'" (I object to the idea of 'suppression'. Suppression is the forcing down of a thing which requires continuous contact whereas what is involved here is separation. Mundane here is also not realistic, this is a major accomplishment, next door to <i>Nibbāna,</i> and is directly on the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">What has happened is that one has attained what is called "freedom from things of Time." This means freedom from any thing that has a beginning, middle, and end. It is temporary because  the freedom so attained is focused on this world or on one or another of the things of this world. The problem described here, not reflecting on the mind apart (Hare's translation focuses on an important way of seeing this), is solved, and lasting freedom attained when, in stead of focusing on some worldly object, one focuses in stead on the freedom attained. This is reflecting on the mind as a thing apart from the things of this world.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Unable to Arise Again in the Future</h4>

					<p class="f4">This is not the one-dimensional thing that is restraint. This is when one has gone up a level or more so that a bad thing is not even seen. "This indicates that such and such a bad thing would arise if going that way." For example, one is tempted to go down a certain street but one knows that going that way one will see the fairest lass of the land which will result in lust arising, so one does not go that way and one avoids the arising lust. With repeated practice and habit the not going that way becomes automatic and is unaccompanied even by trepidation. With more practice and a clearer picture of things as they really are, the lust will not arise even when confronted with such a stimulus because one's mind is on something else altogether. One or more steps removed. A thing which gives one time and distance from a bad situation eventually to the point where whatever the stimulus the distance between that and the arising of some bad state will always produce detachment.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Authenticity</h4>

					<p class="f4">If you do not understand rebirth, you do not really have a grasp of the point of Buddhism or the meaning of pain. If you understand these things then you can see that this business of authenticity has been used in these times as a way of not facing the work involved in bringing this system into your life. The whole of this research called "modern linguistic analysis", EBT (Early Buddhist Texts), "stratification", etc., is invalidated with the idea that a person, maybe hundreds or thousands of years after the Buddha's death might remember a saying that was not recorded in the sutta collections. Comparing sutta with sutta means that one is to take the <i>Dhamma,</i> the instructions or advice as to how to achieve <i>Nibbāna</i> or some other good state, or as to how to eliminate some bad state, and to compare that message and its construction with those suttas that are in the already-formed collection. What lines up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be accepted; what does not line up with <i>Dhamma</i> should be put to the side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not the Bodhi Mind</h4>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> is not an existing thing outside there waiting for you to attain it. This is something that is very difficult to see for the translators. Almost all of them (including Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi) have settled for this existing thing and that is making them, essentially, into Mahāyana Buddhists discovering or reaching a Bodhi Mind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> comes into being for the individual. It is conditioned by the following of the <i>Magga,</i> but it is not own-made <i>(saṇkhāraed).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Following the <i>Magga</i> is a path of not-doings. Not doing this or that, the thing that results is not-done, not <i>saṇkhāred.</i> Following the <i>Magga, Nibbāna</i> is <b>born,</b> but is not "made by the individual".</p>

					<p class="f4">In <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p57">AN 5.57,</a> a parallel construction is put this way but the  connection between "the path" and <i>Nibbāna:</i> is not made by the translators.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one often reflects on being subject to aging, sickness, death, separation from the loved, and being the owner of one's <i>kamma,</i> the path comes into existence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Thanissaro:</p>

					<p class="f4">When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated."</p>

					<p class="f4">E.M. Hare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And while he often contemplates this thing, the Way comes into being"</p>

					<p class="f4">Take birth. The path is generated. Comes into being. Not "is reached," "is discovered."</p>
