					This sutta and the following one are unusual in that they apply a framework usually employed to explain the steps leading to an escape from unskillful qualities, and apply it to a set of skillful qualities: the five faculties. In this way, they make a point similar to that made by the simile of the raft in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p22">MN 22</a>, that the goal is something that lies beyond the path, and that the act of abandoning the path, after it has been developed, is a necessary step in reaching the goal.</p>

					From the Introduction: "'Early Buddhist Teachings' refers to those teachings which are most likely to date from the time of the historical Buddha Gautama or Sakyamuni, 'The Sakyan Sage' (c. 5th century BCE). The largest extant collections of Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs) are the Pali Nikayas of the Pali Canon, and the corresponding Chinese Āgamas of the Chinese Buddhist Canon. These texts are the most widely studied sources for Early Buddhist doctrine. However, there are other sources of Early Buddhist Texts, such as those works preserved in Gandhari, Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit. There are also passages which contain Early Buddhist teachings that are embedded and quoted in later texts. This compilation focuses on these lesser known sources and attempts to collect a wide variety of them.<br />
					This collection thus contains teachings and passages which focus on 'Early Buddhist' doctrines. It includes extracts from many different Indian Buddhist traditions including: Dharmaguptaka, Sarvastivada, Sautrantika, Mulasarvastivada, Mahasamghika, Pudgalavada and Mahayana. It is hoped that this compilation of early Buddhist teachings shows how the basic doctrines found in the Pali Nikayas and Chinese Agamas were also found in the other Buddhist traditions, and thus, how these varied sources point to a 'common core' of Early Buddhist teachings, a core which is more likely to be the original Dharma of the Buddha than other sets of teachings."<br />

					<p class="f4">This whole business of concern for 'authenticity' has gotten out of hand. The whole focus is on early and late, and focus on early and late is mis-directed. It is not the method given us by the Buddha to determine what is and what is not True Dhamma. The Buddha does not speak of what is spoken of by himself alone as being the only True Dhamma, what he recommends is checking any statement against the suttas and the vinaya. What agrees is to be taken as Dhamma; what disagrees is to be put to the side. And this is for one who does not have the insight into the way things really are that comes from actual practice, a method of verification which focuses on the Dhamma within the Dhamma: the lessons contained in the suttas, not who spoke the sutta or when or where or how the situation arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is the problem: <a href="#O.12.16.19">Just below,</a> I have done a little sutta. It is based on a sutta from the Samyutta Nikaya, and does not contain any controversial bias and is as deep as deep can be. It follows True Dhamma. Is this 'authentic'? If you say it is not authentic, you need to ask yourself what the purpose of determining authenticity is if it is not to determine what instructions one would be well advised to follow and what not, for you have just declared what is True Dhamma as being not True Dhamma.</p>

 					The exact similarity in the outward form of the practices of a group of ascetics with a method of instruction used by The Buddha leads to the question of what is the difference between the two sects. The Buddha reveals an interpretation of the doctrine unique to the understanding of the awakened mind, inaccesable through any other source.<br />
					A very rich, complex sutta. A lesson in how a complete path to the goal can be constructed in unlimited ways by the fitting together of various individual components of the Dhamma: in this sutta the Diversions <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">[nivāraṇa]</a> and the Dimensions of Awakening <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">[sambojjhangā]</a>.

					<p>Selected Quotes from K.R. Norman:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>A Philological Approach to Buddhism</b></p>

					<p class="f2 ctr">Used with permission.</p>

					<p>p. 11f.</p>

					<p>If you examine many translations of Buddhist texts the impression you will gain is that the translator has looked at the words, has perhaps looked them up in the dictionary and has ascertained meanings for them, and then has used his intuition to put those words together to reveal the meaning of the Buddhavacana, the word of the Buddha. Sometimes intuition leads a translator to the right result, and sometimes not.</p>

					<p>p. 21</p>

					<p>Another way in which philology, the study of why words mean what they do, can be helpful is that we sometimes find that those who made the first English translations of Buddhist texts gave a particular meaning to a word which we have for the most part followed without change ever since. When we come to look at the words themselves we find that the meanings which we have accepted for so long are very often not the only possible meanings but in some cases not even the most likely meanings. Take for example, the phrase “noble truth”, which I mentioned a few minutes ago. It has become a commonplace to talk about the four noble truths, and this is a perfectly acceptable translation of the compound ariya-sacca : ariya means noble and sacca means truth, so ariya-sacca means noble truth. This translation is so common and so fixed in our minds, that it seems almost like blasphemy to have to point out that not only is this not the only possible translation, but it is in fact the least likely of all the possibilities. If we look at the commentators we find that they knew this very well. They point out that the compound can have a number of meanings. It can mean “truth of the noble one”, “truth of the noble ones”, “truth for a noble one”, i.e. truth that will make one noble, as well as the translation “noble truth” so familiar to us. This last possibility, however, they put at the bottom of the list of possibilities, if they mention it at all. My own feeling is that it is very likely that “the truth of the noble one (the Buddha)” is the correct translation, although we must never lose sight of the fact that in Indian literature multiple meanings are very often intended, so that it is not always possible to say that there is a single correct meaning.</p>

					<p>p. 27f.</p>

					<p>Since I shall in these lectures be giving translations of many of the terms I shall discuss, it would perhaps be sensible to start now by giving some idea of the approach to translation which I have evolved over the years.</p>

					<p>It is very difficult to give a one-for-one translation of Sanskrit and Pāli words into English. It is very rare that one Sanskrit or Pāli word has exactly the same connotations, no less and no more, as one English word. This means that if I wish to give a more adequate translation I am forced to give a phrase in English, or perhaps even a whole sentence, or in the case of a very difficult word with a wide range of connotations, even a whole paragraph. Consequently, if I am translating a Buddhist text into English, it is very difficult to produce something which approximates closely to the meaning of the original, and yet appears in good, clear, concise, and readable English.</p>

					<p>It is for this reason that many translators do not translate the difficult words, but leave them in their original Sanskrit or Pāli form. And this is fine, for them. As they read through their translations, every time they come across a Sanskrit or a Pā̊li word, they know, within limits, what it means, and they can mentally substitute that meaning. It is not, however, so good for the rest of us, who have little idea of what these scholars have in mind, since their translations may consist of little more than strings of Sanskrit, Pāli or Tibetan words linked together with “ands” and “buts”. Reviewers sometimes complain of translations which are so literal and so full of foreign words that they hardly read as English. Such translations are of little value, and one might just as well leave the whole thing in the original. Only an expert can understand all the words left in the original language, and the expert needs no English words at all.</p>

					<p>And so what I have favoured over the years, when translating, is to leave a minimum of these difficult terms in their original form, but the first time they occur, to include a note as lengthy and as detailed as I think is required, giving some idea of what I think the word means, and why I think it means it. In effect I am saying that, every time the reader comes across this word thereafter, he must remember to consult the relevant note to find out what it means in the context. This system does have defects. As anyone who has looked at any of my translations knows, the actual translation is only a small proportion of the book. The notes are far longer, and then there are all the indexes which will enable the reader to find where I dealt first with the problematic word.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">"Ken" for "Jhāna"</h4>

					<p><i>Jhāna</i> 'trance' 'musing', 'gnosis', 'absorption' 'concentration'. I have used 'knowing' and 'burning'. The <i>jhānas,</i> at a certain point definitely resemble or might as well be called trances, but the implication of the word distorts the reality. What these states are is wide-awake, fully conscious awareness of states of reality. The word <i>'jhāna'</i> is the root of our word 'Know' and it would be best to emphasize that aspect of <i>jhāna</i> over the fact that from the outside the individual highly concentrated in <i>jhāna</i> seems to be in a trance state. Hense my regurgitation of the archaic word: 'ken'. This, over 'knowning' for two reasons: 1. the similarity in sound to 'zen' and 'chan' and 'jhana'; and 2. to rise above the ordinary implications of 'knowing' which would otherwise work well.</p>

					<p><b>Ken:</b> OED: "The form is properly causative 'to cause to know', to make known', and was restricted to this use in Goth. and OE. At an early period, however, in all the Teutonic tongues, the verb also acquired the sense 'to know', in English this may have been taken from Norse, in which both senses were in early use." (Likely from the original idea of 'seeing' as 'understanding'. -mo)</p>

					<p>Meanings: 7. "To recognize (at sight or by some marks or tokens); to identify.<br />
					8. To recognize, acknowledge, admit to be (genuine, valid, or what is claimed)<br />
					9. To get to know, ascertain, find out.<br />
					11. To know (a thing): to have knowledge of or about (a thing, place, person., etc.). To be acquainted with, to understand.<br />
					11.b. To know, understand, or perceive (a fact., etc.); to be aware of, to be aware that (what, etc.)."</p>

					<p>While I am at it (I am working on my previous translation of the series of suttas in which the Buddha instructs Mahā Moggallāna on <i>jhāna</i> at <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_40_moggallanasamyutta.htm">SN 4.40.</a>) I have come across a term which is etymologically very close to if not an exact match for 'vicara', that is: 'recur'. Again OED: Re (Vi) + currêre: to run (cara: to move around, or walk around). 4. Of something known, an idea, thought, etc. To come back or return to one's thoughts, mind or memory. But how do we say: "With re-thinking and with-recurring"? So, until the real thing comes along, 're-examination' will have to do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here a beggar,<br />
					just separated from sensuality,<br />
					just separated from unskillful things,<br />
					with-rethinking,<br />
					with re-examination,<br />
					in the pleasant enjoyment<br />
					born of solitude<br />
					abides getting a grip<br />
					on The First Kenning.</p>

					<p class="f4">So now, if everyone is agreed, we have our own English, etymologically correct term specifically for jhāna.</p>

					The Buddha visits the sick ward and delivers a sermon on being prepared for death through recollectedness and self-awareness.<br />
					It is interesting to note the difference in customs and culture between our own and the Buddha's time as can be seen in this sutta. If someone today were to walk into a ward for the terminally ill and deliver a sermon on being prepared to die he would be thought to be in very poor taste ... and as a result of respecting this convention those who were in fact facing immanent death would not hear what they needed to hear. For whose sake, for whose comfort in blindness, then, is our custom of never mentioning death to the dying? Of course our situation is so twisted up today [Friday, November 15, 2019 8:24 AM] that the dying themselves would become offended at this 'behavior in bad taste'.</p>

					<p>The Buddha provides a general rule for the attainment of freedom from yokes in general through yoking one's self to abandoning the realms of the senses.<br />
					The sutta uses puns and depends on understanding the terms 'yoga' and 'pariyaya'. 'Yoga' in it's literal meanings as 'yoke' (as the yoke of a beast of burden to it's burden') and figuratively as 'devotion' or 'application' to a task. 'Pariyaya' means 'pass-round-whatsoever-whatsoever'. Most frequently in the sense of curiculum, or course. But it also means 'in general.' 'everything whatever'. The idea is along the lines of 'abandonging desire through desire to abandon desire;' 'yoked to abandonging the senses one abandons the yokes of the senses.' Here the meaning is that this curiculum will serve in any case of being yoked; that this is the most general way of stating the way to attain freedom.<br />
					I have done a new translation where I attempt to show the pun in the case of 'yoke'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is belated notice that the entire collection of sutta translations and the original Pali found on this site is currently undergoing 'review.' As previously announced, the haste with which the PTS translations were scanned, the scans read, the read-scans converted to html and proofread against the hard-copy originals left many small errors and the occasional big error. These errors are being corrected during this review (cross fingers). In addition, page numbers which were omitted originally are being inserted; the citations to suttas (not to the Vinaya or to the commentaries) in the footnotes are being converted to links; some errors in translation are being corrected; most of the Pali texts and the PTS translations are being unabridged where they were not previously unabridged; both the Pali and the PTS translations are being formatted by phrase for clear comprehension where this was not done previously; and Pali compounds are being hyphinated, although at this time not consistently (sometimes in both senses). The progress of this review will be reported <a href="whats.new.htm#review">above</a>.<br />
					Even with this third or fourth or fifth reading, a thorough, systematic proofreading is still to be desired.<br />
					Please keep this in mind if you have plans to incorporate these materials in derivative works! The justification for such premature releases ... ahum ... is that the materials will be found helpful even in their imperfect state by the tolerant reader, and the wait for an error-free edition might be a very long one.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a malicious and derogatory opinion being broadcast about in certain circles concerning the Pali Text Society Translations that needs to be pointed out and debunked; that is that these translations are 'ancient' and use 'archaic' terminology. This is simply not true on either count. The translations were only completed in the 1950s. Even given that they began in the late 1890s (1899 to be exact), that is only a hair off the 20th century and at this time we are only in the second decade of the 21st Century. So much for 'ancient'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The 'archaic' terminology of Mrs. Rhys Davids, and following her, Woodward, was a conscious choice of style and the 'archaic' part of it largely consists of the use of 'Thee s,' and 'Thou s', the rest of the vocabulary being standard modern English. This was not the way these translators spoke or wrote which was perfectly modern English as anyone could see if they had read any of their other writings. It was a style choice reflecting a belief that such style would best represent the style of the original language. A legitimate translation choice.</p>

					<p class="f4">The disparagement of these works has already created a great deal of damage and negative attitude towards what is still the best (the only!) unbiased (from the point of view of putting forward Buddhist adgendas) series of translations of the Nikayas, and it has been done to advance the personal adgendas and fame of translators of lesser skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fact is that the PTS translations are the basis for all the other translations (it is no great thing to note that most new translations are not translations at all, but edited versions of these translations or edited versions of edited versions of these translations: Thesaurus translations - you can see this in the fact that errors in the PTS are often found in the 'translations' of others), and to ignore the base, to not place them first on one's list of translations to study is poor methodology and an oversight that will work to the disadvantage of anyone who approaches Dhamma study in that way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the problem: Trust. The mind has been subjected to false promises of salvation from samsara since the beginning of Time; it is sceptical to say the least. As wrong an approach as it is, it approaches a new doctrine with fault-finding in mind. Any reasonable thinker, reading a translation will need to check out its sources. That will take the form of working back in time through the previous translations and will, sooner or later, land on the PTS translations prior or subsequent to hitting the Pali itself. So to go elsewhere first, is a waste of time. Do you have time to waste?</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">How Many Æons?</h4>

					<p class="f4">"How many aeons, bhante, have passed and gone by?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Many, bhikkhus, are the æons passed and gone by.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to number them:<br />
					so many æons,<br />
					so many hundreds,<br />
					so many thousands,<br />
					so many hundred thousand æons."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can it be done, bhante, by a parable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can, bhikkhus," said Bhagavā.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose that there were four disciples<br />
					who went on living here for a century,<br />
					and they were to recollect each day<br />
					a hundred thousand æons.</p>

					<p class="f4">The æons are just to be recalled by them, no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at the lapse of the century<br />
					they were to die.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so many aeons, bhikkhus,<br />
					have passed and gone by.</p>

					<p class="f2"><a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_15_anamataggasamyutta.htm#p7">—SN 2.15.7:</a> Adapted from Mrs. Rhys Davids translation.</p>

					<p>4 X 365 X 100,000 X 100 + (25 leap-days X 100000 X 4 = 10,000,000) = 14,610,000,000 æons. Fourteen-billion-six-hundred-and-ten-million æons.</p>

					<p>Modern science (2019) estimates the age of the universe to be between 13.772 billion and 13.82 billion <b>years</b> old.</p>

					<p>The figure for the length of a kappa in years is:</p>

					<p>1 sesame seed removed from a Magadha Karika (cartload) every hundred years. Which I once calculated to contain 103,959,025 sesame seeds. (I counted a tsp worth and worked it out from there)</p>

					<p>100 X 103,959,025 = 10,395,902,500 years
					so in years the Buddhas calculation of the age of the universe is:
					10,395,902,500 X 14,610,000,000 = 1.5188414e+20 = 151,884,135,525,000,000,000 years. So we have a little discrepancy.</p>

					<p>The Buddha's statement as to the length of the kappa in years is:<br />
					10,395,902,500 years using my sesame-seed count.</p>

					<p>The modern science calculation: 13,820,000,000</p>

					<p>That is very close and the difference could be accounted for by a couple of sesame seeds in the original teaspoon.</p>

					<p>So what appears to be the case is that the modern science view is of one kappa only for the age of the Universe.</p>

					<p>Then there is another consideration. The Kappa is supposedly made up of four parts: Evolution, rest, devolution, rest. I wonder how modern science accounts for or doesn't account for that.</p>

					<p>Today [Sunday, September 15, 2019 4:47 AM]: "Study finds the universe might be 2 billion years younger." AP wire service: "Scientists estimate the age of the universe by using the movement of stars to measure how fast it is expanding. If the universe is expanding faster, that means it got to its current size more quickly, and therefore must be relatively younger. The expansion rate, called the Hubble constant, is one of the most important numbers in cosmology. A larger Hubble Constant makes for a faster moving — and younger — universe. The generally accepted age of the universe is 13.7 billion years, based on a Hubble Constant of 70. Jee’s team came up with a Hubble Constant of 82.4, which would put the age of the universe at around 11.4 billion years."</p>

					The Buddha likens the momentum of ignorance to the way the rise and fall of the sea-level influences the momentum of the flow of water in the great rivers, streams, lakes, and feeder streams.<br />
					This sutta poses some difficulties with regard to making the simile comport with the message. The words to understand here are <i>upaya</i> (PED: approach, undertaking, taking up; clinging to, attachment ... in an- (<i>anūpaya metri causa</i>) not going near, aloof, unattached) from <i>upa-upāya,</i> and <i>apaya</i> from <i>an-upāya</i> (I say), which would have the meaning here not of rise or fall, but of flow or impeded momentum.<br />
					There is a phenomena seen in rivers emptying into the ocean of a reverse of flow at flood-tide; but it effects the flow of the river for only a short distance back into the land and it's hard to think that there is any effect at all on the feeder streams or further back. It may happen at a certain very subtle level. I would read the Pali: 'A rise in the ocean impeeds access to it by the river, etc.'</p>

					<p>Self-generated: <i>Samudaya,</i> here with emphasis on the "Saŋ". "Self-rising," if it wern't so easily understood in exactly the opposite of the Buddhist idea. The idea is "raised by it's bootstraps"; not created by some external power or god.  With co-factors, to be sure, but arising in dependance on them, not caused by or created by them. Something that should not be too difficult for those of us with computers to understand. An idiot invented a little pattern with four letters that could look at itself and create a program that could be used to create programs that could be used to experience Aging and Death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>

					<p>The error that results in subjective individuality is that of Mind identifying with the process. The elements of the process carry with them a sort of magnetic field which self-identifies: "I am this, this is my" which when contacted by consciousness claps on to it and creates the illusion of self-identification.</p>

					The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he describes how it is that consciousness arises through contact, sense-experience and perception and that it is by perceiving that that detachment leads to freedom and the knowledge of freedom.</p>

					An outline of the practice to be used by the person interested in comprehending the Paticca Samuppada.<br />
					An important sutta for understanding the method of investigation. The word used here is <i>Parivīmaɱsa.</i> <i>Pari</i> = pass-around; <i>vīmaɱsa:</i> re-member, in the sense of pondering over bringing to mind the various aspects of a thing. This is translated by Bhk. Bodhi as 'thorough investigation' which is also used for the translation of <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> (tracing back in memory the origin of a thing). The distinction is that <i>Parivīmaɱsa</i> encompasses <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> and then projects it forward into those insights which should arise from the determination of the origin of a thing. Generally, however, <i>yoniso-manisikara</i> is more frequently encountered and apparently is assumed to result in these insights.<br />
					<i>Vīmaɱsa:</i> should not be confused with <i>vicara,</i> also translated 'pondering,' although <i>vimaɱsa</i> is probably <i>vicara,</i>.<br />
					Also included in this sutta is a test that measures one's understanding. If one is still making plans, one has not yet got a thorough understanding. This means that although one may understand in theory, intellectually, the real job here is 'seeing' or 'knowing': seeing the inevitable progression from own-making to death in the mind's eye in the real world in absolutely every plan-making without exception.</p>

					Western Buddhists have usually understood the Buddha’s metaphor of nibbana (Sanskrit, nirvana) as "extinguishing" or "extinction". This book, which includes an essay and readings from the Pāli Canon, examines ancient Indian theories on the mechanics of fire in order to understand the Buddha's metaphor in its original context.<br />
					From the Preface: "To study ancient texts is like visiting a foreign city: Time and inclination determine whether you want a quick, pre-packaged tour of the highlights, a less structured opportunity for personal exploration, or both. This book on the connotations of the words <i>nibbāna (nirvāṇa)</i> and <i>upādāna</i> in the early Buddhist texts is organized on the assumption that both approaches to the topic have their merits..."<br />

It is not a sensation in and of itself. It is not 'neutral' sensation. It is not a 'thing' at all. 'Neutrality' indicates a position between two things (like equanimity), a sort of cancelling out of the two by each other; not-painful-but-not-pleasant <i>vedana</i> is a position apart from either painful or pleasant sensation that results when there is no perception of the results of sense-stimulation as in the case of the ending of perception and feeling. It is called 'vedana' because awareness of its existence is dependent on the senses, but it does not arise from sense-stimulation. For the ordinary person this experience will be perceived as unpleasant and that perception, based on blindness, will result in Hunger/Thirst and Planning to Get and the rest; when experienced by the well-educated student of the Aristocrats, it is perceived as a small taste of Nibbāna.</p>

					The Buddha teaches a variation of the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> which works back from the elimination of the corrupting influences. Most frequently called the positive version of the Paticca Samuppada, this sutta is primarily directed at another idea altogether: the necessity in the process of getting rid of the Āsavas (Lust, Existence and Blindness) of making one's self conscious that they are destroyed. Without that fact being recognized, there will follow retrogression.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not recognizing that freedom is first freedom relative to things of Time (this world) and because of that is temporary and only becomes permanent when one has become detached, through recognition of this fact, even from that freedom, resulting in a freedom now called 'freedom from things not of time', that that freedom becomes permanently established, that is an especially important fact being ignored by all the major translators - and practitioners - today.</p>

					An analysis which gives Gotama Buddha's definitions of the terms used in the Paticca Samuppada.<br />
					A couple of points to note here: Note that in &sect;15 <i>'avijjā'</i> is very clearly defined as 'ignorance' <i>'aññāṇa'</i> 'not-knowledge'. I have stated elsewhere that it was my perception that the meaning was not 'ignorance' but 'not seeing', that is not having the experience of seeing the pain of the world as opposed to simply knowing about it through hear-say. Now I revise my thinking such that though the term used is 'not seeing' or 'non-vision' or 'non-wisdom' the meaning should also be understood to include simply never having heard or 'ignorance of' the Four Truths.<br />
					The other thing is to note that in the definition of <i>sankhārā,</i> the third way one sankharas is by way of the heart <i>[citta]</i>, not 'mind' which would be <i>[mano].</i> The term is usually translated (including by myself) as 'Mind'. The difference points to a possible distinction between the identified-with heart and the un-individualized mind - heart is a much more personalized term than is mind - . Put aside the thought that today it makes little difference; in those days (and even in more recent times in English) it appears to have had much more significance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sooner, bhikkhu, would that same load<br />

					than [a term in] the Abbuda Purgatory. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Now one term in the Nirabbuda Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in Abbuda Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">Twenty Kharis = 1 Karika. The Magadha Karika = approximately: 103,959,025 sesame seeds, so the Kosalan Karika would be approximately 415,836,100 sesame seeds or 415,836,100,000 years in Abbuda.<br />

					Contains an early discussion of the difficulty of translating the term <i>'sankhārā'</i> which includes this statement:</p>

							<p class="in2">The word translated 'component things' or 'compounds' is <i>sankhārā,</i> literally confections, from <i>kar,</i> 'to make,' and sam, 'together.' It is a word very frequently used in Buddhist writings, and a word consequently of many different connotations; and there is, of course, no exactly corresponding word in English. 'Production' would often be very nearly correct, although it fails entirely to give the force of the preposition <i>sam;</i> but a greater objection to that word is the fact that it is generally used, not of things that have come into being of themselves, but of things that have been produced by some one else. It suggests, if it does not imply, a producer; which is contrary to the whole spirit of the Buddhist passages in which the word sankhārā occurs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which I respond to thus: Rhys Davids here, as he often does, has hit upon an important fact, but has missed the interpretation most useful for the Buddhist. The <i>'san'</i> in <i>Sankhārā</i> is there because what is being produced is, as well as being a 'thing,' the identification with the thing produced as being one's own, belonging to one; one's own world, own 'self'. The idea of a producer is not necessary when understanding the term this way.</p>

Careful attention or minding will help you note details in a current situation, and, with knowledge of the Four Truths will help you see things as they are, but what is required to free one's self from attachments is to see where the attachment began (what sort of thirst <i>(taṇhā)</i> was involved) and examine the thinking that went into the action that brought the situation about in the first place. Further the practice of tracing things back to their points of origin, made a big thing of, made a habit, conduces to very speedy release from on-coming distractions.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Friendship with the Lovely</h4>

					<p class="f4">As well as frequently being advised as to the danger in association with bad sorts, there is also frequent advice to associate with that which is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">In <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.002.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.45.2,</a> Ānanda says that for him "half the holy life is friendship with what is lovely." This sentiment is echoed throughout the suttas (<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_45_maggasamyutta.htm#p56">SN 5.45.56;</a> <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.017.wood.pts.htm">AN 10.17;</a> etc.) and the Buddha's famous response is that no, this is not the case, what is the case is that the whole of the holy life could be said to be friendship with the lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">This statement has been widely interpreted to mean just having a companion whose company one enjoys, aka 'a Dhamma friend'. But this is not the way this should be understood. There is responsibility involved in the office of the 'lovely friend'. And it is this responsibility that makes the satement that the whole of the religious life is friendship with the lovey rational.</p>

					<p class="f4">The important thing to note is the description of the benefits of such a friend: "Of a bhikkhu who is a friend of the lovely we may expect that among other good things, he will cultivate the Magga.</p>

					<p class="f4">How exactly friendship with the lovely results in cultivation of the Magga is revealed in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_01_devatasamyutta.htm#p18">SN 1.3.18</a> where the Buddha explains that a person who is considered a lovely companion in the holy life will instruct his friends in the Magga:</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">"From a bhikkhu, Ānanda, who is a friend to righteousness, we expect that he will develop and expand the Ariyan eightfold path of one who is a friend, an intimate, an associate of that which is righteous.</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">And how, Ānanda, does a bhikkhu who is a friend, an intimate, an associate of that which is righteous, expand the Ariyan eightfold path?</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">He is taught, Ānanda, to develop right views based on detachment, based on passionlessness, based on cessation, involving maturity of surrender;<br />
							to develop in the same way,<br />
							right plans,<br />
							right speech,<br />
							action and livelihood,<br />
							right effort,<br />
							right mindfulness,<br />
							and right concentration.</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">It is thus, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu who is a friend, an intimate, an associate of that which is righteous, develops and expands the Ariyan eightfold path.</p>

							<p class="f3 in2">And it is in just this way, Ānanda, that thou must understand how the whole of this life in religion is concerned with friendship, intimacy, association with whatsoever is lovely and righteous."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="https://notesonthedhamma.blogspot.com/2019/06/flt-video-megaturtle-full-lotus-around.html">Ffrank has posted a video</a> showing his sit-down 'warm-up' routine (or part of it).<br />
					Concerning such exercise routines, there is no mention in the suttas of any yoga-type practices. The physical exercise that the bhikkhus had seems to have been walking to and from their begging rounds (which could have been as much as 20 miles of walking a day!), pacing back and forth, and various chores around the vihara. Walking can be a thoroughly therapeutic excercise (as is sweeping and raking) and may be all that is needed. On the other hand sitting for any length of time will often result in spontaneously performing exactly one or another or many of the stretches ffrank shows here. It is the question of intent that is of concern: Is intentionally exercising perhaps setting going unnecessary bodily <i>kamma</i>? (Where waiting for the spontaneous urge to stretch, (which stretch would be the sort of <i>kamma</i> that ends <i>kamma</i> if construed as a response to the needs of the body), would at least limit the <i>kamma</i> to the exercise the body is saying it needs). It is certainly a 'doing', but are the benefits in extended sit-down times a worthwhile expenditure?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ffrank also has <a href="https://notesonthedhamma.blogspot.com/2019/06/im-dhamma-guerrilla-relationship.html">an interesting take on emojis,</a> likening them to the Chinese pictogram. Personally I can't make heads or tails of most of them and they do not have pop-up explanations so they go blank on me. Old dog new tricks.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking off from a discussion on a Certain Discussion Board: <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p136">MN 136</a> has the statement:</p>

					      <p class="in2">"... there is the case of some person here who abstains from slaughtering living creatures, taking what has not been given to him and who does not abandon his ethical conduct in the pursuit of pleasure, he abstains from speaking lies, slander, the use of harsh language, is no gossip, is not covetous or cruel and holds High View.<br />
							He, at the breaking up of the elements at death finds consciousness again in the Way of Woe, as an animal, or in Niriaya Hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">The questioner and many of the respondents appear to be mistaking 'having <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (High View)' for 'being a Streamwinner', and are, as a result, thrown into confusion concerning the numerous statements throughout the suttas that the Streamwinner is henceforth and forever freed from the possibility of rebirth in Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">First, though the Streamwinner must have High View, High View is not the only requirement for Streamwinning. Generally the formula for Streamwinning is that the eye of Wisdom has opened and the Streamwinner sees that 'Whatsoever has come to be, comes to an end.' In other words, Streamwinning is not just the possession of knowledge (intellectually understanding High View) but also is a matter of achieving insight as to the implications of that High View (that absolutely every existing thing will at some time come to an end).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case (raised in the discussion) that there are in the suttas two different formulas for <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i>. The one people first come across is that <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> is the first dimension of the <i>Magga,</i> that is, The Four Truths. The second formula is the one that states that <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> is the view that 'there is' concerning:</p>

					      <p class="in2">"almsgiving, sacrifice, offering. There is fruit, there is result of good and evil deeds. This world is, the world beyond is. There is mother and father, there are beings of spontaneous birth. In the world are recluses and brahmins who have won the summit, who have won perfection, who of themselves have realized by supernormal power both this world and the world beyond, and proclaim it."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, of course, the first of these which is being mistaken for Streamwinning, but it is most likely that it is the second of these which is being referred to in MN 136.</p>

					<p class="f4">The MN 136 sutta is dealing with the apparent contradiction in Dhamma that occurs when a seer sees that a man of such good character could go to Hell. The resolution of the paradox is that such a person may have done a bad deed previous to his being observed as a good man, or may have done a bad deed after having been so observed, or may have abandoned <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> and taken up <i>Micchā Diṭṭhi</i> at the time of death.</p>

					<p class="f4">So there is no real issue here. A person may have either of the two <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi's</i> and yet not be a Streamwinner and may be subject to a change of view.</p>

					<p class="f4">The question of the Streamwinner by Faith should not come up here: such a one is safe only in so far as his faith is solid, if he gets distracted by some apparently higher method or just looses faith because of some aparent contradiction in the Dhamma ... ahum ... , then he is no longer safe or a Streamwinner.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>On Eliminating Bias</b></p>

					<p class="f4">We are told that bias/prejudice is bad and that we should get rid of it. But being biased and thinking "I am biased"; one will never be able to get rid of bias.</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because there is no thing there that is this "I" in which there is this bias.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no way to find this bias to see it, analyze it, understand it, get rid of it because it is not where you are looking.</p>

					<p class="f4">But thinking "There is bias in me" (the 'me' there being conventional speech) and focusing on getting rid of every instance of the <b>expression</b> of that bias, gets rid of that bias.</p>

					<p class="f4">This way of dealing with faults completely eliminates the reluctance one has to admit faults because seeing things this way, faults are never a reflection on the core values one wishes to see in one's self, they are always 'out there'; it is curiously impersonal and liberating.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>On Seeing</b></p>

					<p class="f4">It is very important to 'seeing' that one have a clear idea of this business of the absolute center. (see below <a href="#O.3.8.19.2">O.3.8.19.2</a>) Any deviation from that, in either yourself, or in what you see of others, is a result of wanting. Where seeing gets confused is in not recognizing the subtle levels of wanting. So many things one does are just poses; poses come from wanting to appear in a certain way ("Look Ma! No hands!"); that is, wanting. When you see the deviation, you can see the opinions or points of view that were their basis. You could say that any deviation off absolute zero was bias. This is information and with your own mind at zero, that information can be understood.</p>

					<p class="f4">The movement off zero is sankharaming, a disturbance, a ripple in the cosmos, energy being projected outwards, and always is a projection of the desire to be, to have and to hold, to own. This is what the seer sees, and it is this phenomena (or, rather, the lack of it) that explains the tracklessness of the arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What about responses?" you might ask. When you are asked a question or asked to do something and you respond to the precise degree demanded by the request and no more, (even to the point of an expression on the face, a jesture, etc.), that does not fall under own-making, it is not a projection of self and so the zero point has not been left;  there is no <i>kamma</i> associated with such a deed, it falls within the description of the sort of <i>kamma</i> which ends <i>kamma</i>. It is exactly an abstention, but it is of not projecting any intent other than to bring the situation to resolution by the answer or the deed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>On Signs</b></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'Nimitta'</i> in the case of instructions as to developing <i>jhāna,</i> is not just this 'reflex image' thing, though that may be a sign. What we should be doing is recognizing the signs that occur to us in our development of <i>jhāna.</i> "I see that <i>pīti</i> arises when I do this". "I notice that the longer I focus the mind on the mouth the higher, clearer and  more encompassing are the visions and insights I gain when I do take off into some subject."  "Ah! Whenever I do/think x or whenever x appears, I am about to loose my concentration." (e.g., allowing one's self to dwell on the attractive features of some erotic image that comes to mind) Etc. The idea is 'tracking'. Following the tracks.</p>

					Ananda instructs the Buddha's uncle Mahānāma concerning the morality, serenity and wisdom of the seeker and the morality, serenity and wisdom of the adept.</p>

					<p>Mahānāma asks the question: "Which comes first? Knowledge [<i>ñāṇa</i>] or Serenity [<i>samādhī</i>]. This is another way of asking which comes first <i>samatha</i> [calming down] or <i>vipassana</i> [insight].</p>

					<p>Ānanda's response shows that the method is more complex than this simple construction. It is a chicken or egg problem.</p>

					<p>He explains a progression:</p>

					<p>First one becomes knowledgable by way of developing one's ethics, perfecting serenity, and developing wisdom (a mixture of understanding ethics and putting ethical thinking and behavior into practice, developing <i>samādhi</i> through the <i>jhānas,</i> and with experience developing wisdom) and then using these faculties to see and understand the Four Truths. So far one is still a seeker, not an adept.</p>

					<p>Then, with this mixture of faculties complete, and this knowledge of the Truths seen clearly, directing the mind to the destruction of the corrupting influences, (lust for sense pleasures, becoming, and blindness); having destroyed them, abiding in a heart free from corruption, a mind with corruption-free perception.</p>

					<p>Experience will show that as well as having loop-backs within each of the two practices, the two parts themselves revolve around each other to the end.</p>

The passage quoted should be read substituting 'Nibbana' for 'God' and 'intent' for 'prayer' and requires a liberal flexible attitude towards descriptions of the goal, but with that one could well say of Balzac that here, given knowledge of the Dhamma, could have been another of the arahants.

					By identification with intentional deviant, non-deviant or mixed deeds one creates personal experience of deviant, non-deviant or mixed worlds.<br />
					The reader should keep in mind that the word <i>'sankhāra'</i> is very much like and almost a synonym of 'kamma' and needs to accommodate both the act of creation and the thing that results. The differentiation between this term and kamma is essentially the emphasis put on the personal nature of the creating and the results. To <i>'sankhara'</i> one identifies with the intent to create personal experience by way of thought, word or deed. The result is personal experience formed by the nature of the intent when creating. (This sutta describes the process.) The word, properly translated must convey this dual nature and this personalizing process. I have suggested 'own-making' <i>Saŋ = own; + khāra = make.</i> and 'the own-made'. What it is not is just 'activities' or 'mental formations' or 'fabrications' or anything else without the sense of those activities etc being the means of constructing one's own personal world. But 'activities' although sankharing is activity, does not relate etymologically with the word at all, and 'mental ... and volitionl' are also 'explanations' unrelated to the word. Sticking closely to the Pali we could get: 'con-struction', 'con-fection,' 'con-juration,' 'co-formation,' etc. But where we have elsewhere [see <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p32">AN 3.32</a>] the terms 'I-making' and 'My-making' why not also 'Own-making?' What it absolutely is not is 'conditioning'...which translation leads into major misunderstanding of Dhamma.

					<p class="f4">I'm just a little behind the times ... not too much ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In September of 2017, Bhk. Thanissaro wrote:</p>

							<p class="in2">"When I was up in the Bay Area last week, I came across a new word: corelessness. Apparently, the latest fashion is to claim that the Buddha said we are coreless, and that that’s the meaning of anatta. In other words, there’s a jumble of karmic activities that make up a human being. That’s what you are. The anatta teaching, in this interpretation, is not a not-self teaching; it’s a no-self teaching. It answers the question of what you are, saying that what you are has no core. You’re like a karmic fuzz ball. All the fuzz that’s picked up as the fuzz ball moves across the floor under the force of the wind is held together only by static electricity, but there’s no real core there. This is supposed to represent what the Buddha taught about what we are.</p>

							<p class="in2">The problem is that the Buddha never talked about what we are."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.5.11.19fn1" href="#O.5.11.19n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the careful reader (I am sure I have one) knows that I (and Jim Carry) have promoted the idea of the individual personality as being something like fly-paper (or a fuzzball if you will), but without the fly paper: an evolving vortex<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="O.5.11.19fn2" href="#O.5.11.19n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of bits that have been aquired from without through programming, grasping, attraction, and accident; a thing without a center, or central core.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is the problem: What Bhk. Thanissaro is saying is that there <i>is</i> a core to the individual; his argument defeats his own argument. He correctly states that the Buddha refrains from describing what the self is, but what he has here is a statement made by himself as to what the self is. What is being said <i>here</i> is that there is no thing there that is the core of the individual, though there is a core to the practice.</p>

							<p class="in2">But there is beggars, unshakable heart-release —<br />

					<p class="f4">How is this to be understood?</p>

					<p class="f4">Following the Magga one drops off, lets go, renounces, gives up bit by bit the accumulated detritus until at the end an absolute detachment from any existing thing has been accomplished. That which was the individuality So-and-so (in reality a mistaken identification with the fuzzball), has been entirely eliminated. What remains is the core ... not of the individual, but of the practice. An un-pin-downable, invisible consciousness; a consciousness which has no existing thing as its object; a freedom of mind and heart that is not dependent on existing phenomena, fed (sustained) by freedom itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sort of following up on the reference below to the state of the world - one more shot at convincing people that <i>'upekkha'</i> should be being translated 'detachment', not 'equanimity'.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a hell, so-called, called the Sataporisa Avicci, where one finds consciousness after the break-up of the body buried under a pile of 'gutha' 100-men high.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now imagine that one there has found a stout string (sutta) promising to lead one to the surface. Thinking: "By means of this string I will escape the Sataporisa Avicci!" and he works his way along the string and sees that he is slowly rising to the surface but final escape depends on his understanding of the term <i>'upekkha'.</i> where some profess the term to mean 'Equanimity', and the Professor states that the term means 'detachment'.</p>

					<p class="f4">So here is the question:</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagining yourself to be this man, struggling to free himself from that huge pile, which would you rather have: Detachment from or Equanimity in your situation?</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Who Seeks a Teacher?</h4>

					<p class="f4">I see a tremendous waste of energy being expended in people's efforts to determine whether this teacher or that is an Arahant. We hear words of praise of such-and-such a one: "He is much honored by the people; he is of perfect virtue; he is a great meditation master; he has knowledge and vision; he certainly has magic powers; he can read minds!" But these are not the goal and to draw the conclusion that one possessing such is an arahant is to place trust where it is unwarranted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why unwarranted?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because it is not possible for one who is at a lower level of detachment to know the state of one of a higher level of detachment. It is precisely the opposite of the investigation that should be being made.</p>

					<p class="f4">What one should examine, in attempting to determne if a person is worth while to seek out as one's teacher is where that person demonstrates characteristics that are incompatable with a given state of detachment, or below one's own state of detachment. An Arahant, for example, cannot indulge in sexual intercourse. You see your potential teacher engaging in the pleasures of sexual intercourse, you can know for certain that he is not an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">One may not be able to see if a person 'is' but one can see when a person 'isn't'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The endless debates about the difficulty of attaining jhāna is a red herring, an excuse to be blunt, to concentrate on an irrelevant topic (the difficulty) rather than the simple putting into practice of the instructions.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you trust what is called an authority by those who are called authorities today, then go ahead and get wound up in this debate, but know that going by authority is not the method of the Pali. Until you are Arahant, your only authority is the Dhamma as we have it in the most original documentation, and even that is conditional: a trial-and-error relationship to the instructions. And the reality is that here today [USAmerica, Wednesday, April 24, 2019 8:16 AM] there is no-one vouched for by the Buddha; any claim to jhāna attainment other than strictly according to the Pali formula is just a guess. You take one of these contemporary authorities as your basis for trust you are setting yourself up for a fall. The truth of the Dhamma can be worked out exclusively through the study of the suttas. That is, for one who is serious. Otherwise you are trusting that your authority is not one who has deluded himself with attainment of one of the vast number of extra-ordinary mental states which can be experienced by the mind: a sea of traps.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the thing, folks: Take a look out there at the state of the World. It's not so hard to get a fair idea now that we have the Internet and Google. A person who's mind is <b><i>not</i></b> obsessed with lust, hate and delusion is not easy to find. That one should reach a point in one's evolution where one is able to rise above the stench for even just so long as it takes to snap the fingers, is a person who has accomplished something extremely rare. Do not sell yourself short!</p>

					This is one of what is called the "Wheel" style of sutta construction. These are frequently found at the ends of 'books'; sometimes elsewhere, sometimes shorter than this one, sometimes longer. These are exercises in memory building; mental gymnastics. These wheel suttas are almost universally ignored and disparaged as 'tedious repititions'. Your homework is to read the sutta in its entirety and at least give memorizing it a shot. Read it slowly and do not skip! If you at least give this a try, I guarantee one outcome if nothing more: you will end up with an appreciation of the extreme difficulty of the task and therefore you should be able to see that it is a valuable tool for the exercise of the memory. There is the potential for one who memorizes this sutta of attaining very interesting mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">The goal of this Dhamma is said to be "not of Time". But what does "not of time" actually mean?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is an illustrative example:</p>

					<p class="f4">When you abstain from a habit, the result in terms of withdrawl experiences and perception of effect can be perceived in two ways:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. By attending to changes in the material things of one's world (shapes, perceptions, sense-experiences, own-makings and individualized consciousness); or<br />
					2. by not attending to material things, but to the fact of being free from the usual results of the indulgence of the habit.</p>

					<p class="f4">The former is a mater of time,
					the latter is a thing not of time.</p>

					<p class="f4">The former is bound up in the evolution of the world (aka:Time): to reach freedom that way involves "seeing the story through to the end", at the end you get your just reward (or, in most cases, you come to see the false promise of 'salvation as a future reward for the dutifull following of some rule or ritual');<br />
					the latter is instantaneous; the instant the habit is dropped, the freedom starts.<br />
					Where you focus the mind is up to you.</p>

					The Buddha explains that it is a consequence of acting upon lust, hatred and stupidity that there is killing, theft, sexual misconduct, lies, spite, bitter speech, idle babble, coveting ones neighbours goods, working harm and wrong view, and that to bring these things to an end it is necessary to end the intentional action (kamma) bound up in lust, hate and stupidity that brings them into being.<br />
					This is a valuable sutta in that it shows how one can use the heirarchical structure of the mind to short-cut one's progress. I have used the simile of two people looking to gratify their taste for chocolate. One seeks out a Dark Chocolate Teuscher's Champaign Truffle, the other thinks of chocolate generically. Who is most likely to find their craving gratified first? Here in this sutta we learn that in stead of attacking various unskillful states serially (killing, theft, sexual misconduct, etc.), by focusing in stead on their root dependencies (lust, hate and stupidity) they can be dealt with in a much simpler, swifter way. This is but one example of this trick; there are suttas in which a bhikkhu asks for a lesson in brief and gets a one-word lesson in response: You can do the whole thing using 'appamāda' or 'taṇha' or 'upekkha'. There is also <a href="../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualnidana.htm#ahara">Lesson One</a>.</p>

Woodward translates <i>'sammā'</i> and <i>'micchā'</i> as right and wrong, which would be better as 'high' and 'low', or 'consummate' and 'contrary'. For discussion of these terms see: <a href="../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/samma_miccha~.htm">On "Sammā" "Miccha," "Ariya," and "Angika"</a></p>

					Almost identical to the previous sutta except that here Gotama asserts that all those who have unwavering faith in him are Streamwinners. Something to consider for those insisting that there can be no stream-entry without breaking <a href="../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#FundamentalAttachments">the first three samyojanas</a>. The catch is of course the 'unwavering' part. It is an easy thing to say one has unwavering faith in something when one has studied it for years or decades or practiced it a little with good results, but this is a wide world and the mind is organized in hierarchies and unless the person has crossed the line marked by the 'dhamma eye': "<i><b>all things</b></i> that have come into existence are destined to come to an end" the mind which had latched onto faith through fear (not a high level in the hierarchy) could find a greater satisfaction in someone dying on the cross for their sins, for example, or in the idea that there was no self, or in the idea that this was a one-shot thing and there was no possibility of having to pay up, than in concepts such as compassion, giving or ethical behavior ... themselves not high up in the pecking order. In fact, faith based on such things is one of the three things that the usual definition of the streamwinner suggests must be broken. Still the possibility exists that a person with no more than a faith that the Buddha taught a way to freedom, or a way to the end of pain, might tenaceously hold on to that faith at death and that tenacious hanging on could drag them into a rebirth where their faith could find growth and develop into knowledge and vision, so it is a true statement to say it can be done by faith alone.<br />
					One more thing: there was a point not too far back where many of those of us who had faith in Gotama's teaching were trying to make the idea of faith sound palatable to a population heartily disenchanted with a faith that depended on faith that had proved incapable of inspiring it's leaders to remain on the path of righteousness, so to speak. There was a big effort to convince everyone that faith in Buddhism was not faith, but 'confidence' [e.g. Bhk. Bodhi in his translation of this sutta] or 'conviction' [Bhk. Thanissaro] or 'trust' or 'well-reasoned or grounded trust' [me], but here the plain fact of the case is that this sutta is speaking about blind faith and I think we need to accept the fact that there is this level of trust, conviction and confidence in Gotama and his system as well and that it is not without good results. There are those of us who would like to think of Gotama's system as mathematically pure science, which it is, but we need also to recognze that there are those who have blind faith even in pure mathematics, and that it is not therefore a danger to the system that there are such believers. ... it's when a person has confidence and conviction that their blind faith is well grounded and starts proselytizing that the trouble starts, but that is another story.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Exercise</h4>

					<p class="f4">Go to your place to be alone, prepare your seat, sit down sitting up straight, legs folded in front forming a lap, and take the mind from wherever it is wandering around and place it on the area around the mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think of this as your center.</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of having a center is to have a place around which you can organize your mind and from which you start out on sitting down to sit and to which you can return when thoughts peter out or become confused. There is more to this than that, and to demonstrate just one feature is the point of this exercise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, with mind kept focused on the mouth, locate the breathing. In the same way as with Satipatthana practice, make yourself aware of the in and out breaths. The point of this exercise is not to concentrate on the breathing. Let that idea go. See the breathing from the base of the stomach to the area around the mouth as a vibrating energy field.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take this energy field as the body itself; the whole body. See how your idea of 'my body' is emanating from this energy configuration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then imagine this energy configuation as a one-stringed musical instrument. As the string vibrates, in place of a sound, see that: 'in accordance with the vibration, so is your body and the world in which it is located being created.' When the string is vibrating chaotically, so is your world; when the string is still, your world is calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what you want to do now is to still, calm and tranquillize that vibrating string.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the point where that string becomes very still you may see the world split into what appears like two mirrors facing each other at an angle; again with the world streaming off in both directions from the center divide. The images on either side will appear flat; one-dimensional. (Three-dimensional vision occurs when the images of the two mirrors are superimposed on each other in normal perception.)</p>

					<p class="f4">Many different things can be discovered with this perception, but do not pay any attention to them at this point.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you want to do at this point; and it may happen spontaneously; is to take the center line (the string) and shrink it down to one point located in the area around the mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the point where you have focused the mind on your mouth and the breathing process - keeping the focus on the mouth, not extending it to the whole body, continue to keep this dual perception (mouth and breath) in focus.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>It is clear in the suttas that there are two main approaches to awakening: you can basically just sit there with the determination that you will not get up again until you have achieved awakening <b>(I know when I am not free; I will know when I am free)</b>; or, as more frequently practiced, one can work one's way through one's blindness a problem at a time according to a graduated path. In other words the concentration practice described to this point can be used as a brute-force path to awakening but will here be described as the vehicle to use to pass from one state of awareness to another (<b>arriving at one level of consciousness by abandoning another</b>) until all barriors to awakening have been dealt with individually. Zero point center &gt; problem under investigation &gt; zero point center ... etc. Step-by-step all the way to Nibbāna.</p>
							<p><img src="../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">This is the center-point, the absolute zero of your center.</p>

					<p class="f4">This focus on your 'center' is something like tacking into the wind for the sailor. It is concentration on zero with the result that the longer it is held steady, the higher and more refined and more interesting and more yielding to insight will be the visions that appear to the mind's eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the appearance of any interesting memory; or after having intentionally focused on some subject, in stead of withdrawing from the perception of the resulting images and returning to focus on the breathing (<i>as the conventional approach to Satipatthana practice is taught</i>), continue to return in stead to the thing being seen, the story or the logic or even the fantasy you are following.</p>

					<p class="f4">Continue to concentrate on this one subject. It may be necessary to return to it again and again over an extended period of time alternating between concentration on the area of the mouth and the breating and your subject, but sooner or later what will happen is that the story under examination will 'open up' and reveal what was not seen before.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not really matter how significant the subject; there is no detail of your life that does not connect to all the others; everything supports everything else and leads to everything else.</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of this exercise is to demonstrate one of the basic functions of Satipatthana practice. What Satipatthana practice is not about is concentration on the breathing. This concentration is simply a tool in aid of insight. What Satipatthana practice <i>is</i> about is providing a framework <i>(Bhk. Thanissaro's translation for Satipatthana, which is a bad translation, but a good description of the actual function of this practice)</i> onto which one hangs one's understanding of this 'being' that we are identifying with. You take your problem, or your memory, or your fantasy and you examine it for its elements relating to personal form (body); sense-experience; mental states; and the Dhamma. What you are doing is examining phenomena through the lens of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This practice of doggedly examining in this way through the lens of the Dhamma is the practice of <i>yoniso-manisikara,</i> or tracing things back to their point of origin. It might well also be called <i>'vicara'</i> 'examination'. It might also be called <i>'vicaya'</i> 'research'. It might also be called <i>'vimaɱsa'</i> 'reminiscence' or 'investigation'. However it fits into the Dhamma the result in 'opening up' is the 'falling off' of blindness, or what you did not previously see of what was there all along and that would be <i>'vipassana'</i> 'insight'.</p>

					The Buddha describes the benefits of giving all up and the dangers in pleasures of the senses. The essence of the sutta is a not too difficult to understand progression of lettings-go  leading to Nibbana by way of the Jhānas.</p>

					<p>This sutta has two interesting features. The first is that there is here the only case that I know of where 'vitakka' alone is said to be the obstruction to the second jhāna. To me this makes sense if one sees that although ultimately, there being no self there, all existing things come from the outside, it is thoughts that approach one, asking for attention, whereas pondering (vicara) is an action taken by the individual and is therefore more or less under one's control and is by that not so much of an obstruction as thinking.</p>

					<p>The other interesting thing in this sutta is an apparent dissonance between the way it begins and the way it goes on after the Second Jhāna. The first part sets one pattern, but subsequent to the second jhāna another pattern is used. Further within the second pattern two other incompatable patterns are used. I found it impossible to reconcile the differences and what I have here in this translation is a reconstruction based on a pattern that makes sense to me. The Hare translation I have left abridged as he has it, so you can see the problem, and I have left the Pali also as it appears in the PTS texts, but I have also provided a second Pali reconstructed to parallel my translation. All other translations have the single occurance of 'vitakka' though none note it's uniqueness in the Pali. No translator notes the confusion of patterns. All versions can be found in the Index.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The Problem with Worldly Activisim</h4>

					<p>For the seeker after ultimate freedom, freedom of mind, freedom of heart, freedom of consciousness, the inniinvisable consciousness, living outside time, the Deathless, the unborn, Nibbāna, orientation towards getting creates the situation where every existing thing becomes an obstruction to this freedom, every effort to attain binds one more strongly to this world, not the least because of the anger and frustration likely to be experienced at not attaining; primarily because ultimate freedom cannot be attained while caught up in the sorts of points of view that inspire worldly activisim and the sorts of deeds that follow.</p>

					<p>But for one oriented towards letting go, desire to change the world, improve the world, act in the world in any way is seen as the obstruction. That is the starting point, the background, the given, and there is no expectation that messing with the world will yield anything more than pain. And every even very transient experience of freedom that results from not-doing is seen as a blessing, a release, a reward, a confirmation that such ultimate freedom exists and can be found, a motivator, encouraging courage and fortitude in letting it all go.</p>

					<p>For one unconcerned with personal escape from pain into ultimate freedom, of course, this is not seen as a problem. And teaching others, encouraging others in worldly activism is not seen as misguiding those who follow.</p>

					<p>This is not to say that doing good deeds in the world, while maintaining an over-all orientation towards letting go, is not good kamma and correct practice. It is. And such deeds are encouraged as stepping stones to building confidence in letting go of what is hard to let go of. But, to use Don Juan's term, such deeds should always be seen as 'controlled folly'.</p>

					<p>It can be seen that one can successfully use action to abandon action; desire to let go of desire, but the motive of changing the world even for the better is not that, it is a grasping after personal gain. Always!</p>

					<p>Compassion for beings should be oriented towards their ultimate good and that is best taught by example and the example to be followed in this Dhamma is that of the Buddha letting it all go.</p>

					<p>So say I.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Cetaso Ekodibhāvaɱ = Single Heart</h4>

					<p>The meaning is 'not duplicitous'.</p>

					<p><i>King Henry VIII,</i> William Shakespeare, Act V, iii, Cranmer:<br />
					"My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress<br />
					Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,<br />
					And with no little study, that my teaching<br />
					And the strong course of my authority<br />
					Might go one way, and safely; and the end<br />
					Was ever to do well: nor is there living,<br />
					I speak it with <b>a single heart,</b> my lords,<br />
					A man that more detests, more stirs against,<br />
					Both in his private conscience and his place,<br />

					<p class="f1">page 1361, Col. 2. <i>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare,</i> The Cambridge Edition Text, as edited by William Aldis Wright, Doubleday, Doran &amp; Compny, Inc., 1936</p>

					<p>Today we would say: 'single-minded' or 'whole-hearted' with the negative connotation being "having a one-track mind".</p>

					<p>That 'might go one way' might also be the idea in back of 'Ekāyano'; again, not hypocritical or duplicitous or having a hidden adgenda.</p>

					<p><span class="f4"><i>From the Preface by Bhikkhu Thanissaro:</i></span> <span class="f3">"... a two-volume book that attempts to give an organized, detailed account of the Vinaya training rules and the traditions that have grown up around them. The Pāṭimokkha training rules as explained in the Sutta Vibhaṅga are the topic of the first volume; the rules found in the Khandhakas, the topic of the second. The book as a whole is aimed primarily at those whose lives are affected by the rules—bhikkhus who live by them, and other people who have dealings with the bhikkhus—so that they will be able to find gathered in one location as much essential information as possible on just what the rules do and do not entail. Students of Early Buddhism, Theravādin history, or contemporary Theravādin issues should also find this book interesting, as should anyone who is serious about the practice of the Dhamma and wants to see how the Buddha worked out the ramifications of Dhamma practice in daily life. The amount of information offered here is both the book’s strength and its weakness. On the one hand, it encompasses material that in some cases is otherwise unavailable in English or even in romanized Pali, and should be sufficient to serve as a life-long companion to any bhikkhu who seriously wants to benefit from the precise and thorough training the rules have to offer. On the other hand, the sheer size of the book and the mass of details to be remembered might prove daunting or discouraging to anyone just embarking on the bhikkhu’s life. To overcome this drawback, I have tried to organize the material in as clear-cut a manner as possible. In particular, in volume one I have analyzed each rule into its component factors so as to show not only the rule’s precise range but also how it connects to the general pattern of mindfully analyzing one’s own actions in terms of such factors as intention, perception, object, effort, and result—a system that plays an important role in the training of the mind. In volume two, I have gathered rules by subject so as to give a clear sense of how rules scattered randomly in the texts actually relate to one another in a coherent way."</span></p>

					<h4 class="ctr c">By Means of the First Gnosis</h4>

					<p class="f2 ctr">Being a discourse based on the first section of<br />
					<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p36">AN 9.36: <i>Jhāna-Nisasaya Suttaɱ</i></a></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Laid down at Sāvatthi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say, beggars, that the destruction of the corrupting influences,<br />
					is had just by means of the First Gnosis."</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><b>Corrupting influences:</b> <i>Āsāvas:</i> (1) Seeking out sense-pleasures, (2) the desire to exist, and (3) blindness as to the result of existence in pain. 'The destruction of the <i>āsāvas:'</i> is another way of naming Arahantship.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><b>First Gnosis.</b> <i>Paṭhamaɱ-jhānaɱ.</i> The first point at which one can know and see the point of the Dhamma and the method for attaining its ends. The fundamental nature or character of the first Gnosis is that there is here a conscious appreciation of the peace and calm of solitude. It is the first point at which actual experience shows one with the insight to appreciate it, the benefits of solitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what has been said,<br />
					and because of what is this said?</p>

						<p class="in1">Taking himself to some place of solitude,<br />
						the root of some tree,<br />
						a cave on some mountainside,<br />
						a heap of straw in an open field,<br />
						or an empty hut;<br />
						sitting down,<br />
						sitting up straight,<br />
						head, neck and back in alignment with the perpindicular,<br />
						legs crossed Indian Style,<br />
						he minds the area around the mouth.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><b>Legs crossed Indian Style</b> For very long meditation sessions, better than either the full lotus or the half lotus - at least for those not brought up to using those postures - the Indian style, (that is the Native American 'Indian') where the legs are crossed in front of one, but do not overlap or rest under each other is the seat which can be maintained for the longest time with the least discomfort.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><b>He minds the area around the mouth</b> for the very simple reason that this is a very small, simple thing on which to focus and which serves as a 'center'. When you want to let it all go, you will want as little there to let go of as possible. The face is much more complex of a thing to let go than the mouth. It is also the mouth which is the starting point of existence in a body and it is further the place where most trouble begins (it is where you shovel in the food, and spew forth your bile). "Watch your mouth!" When this center is fully established, it then may prove valuable to mind the face, where one will find all the sense organs located and one can observe the reactions of such to sense-stimulus; or one may mind the interface of the body with the world, or of the body and the world as distinct from the mind, or mind to bring minding to the forefront of one's endeavours at setting up minding (1) the body, (2) the experiences, (3) the mental states and (4) The Dhamma. Start with minding around the mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, a beggar is so separated from sense-pleasures,<br />
					separated from unskillful things,<br />
					that with thinking,<br />
					with pondering the appreciation<br />
					of the pleasures born of solitude<br />
					there is thus entrance into<br />
					and habituation of the First Gnosis.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><b>Sense pleasures:</b> <i>(kāma)</i> (1) Indulging in sights, (2) sounds, (3) scents, (4) savours, and (5) touches.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><b>Unskillful things:</b> <i>(akusalehi dhammehi)</i> The <i>Nīvaraṇā:</i> The Diversions: (1) Wishing for sense-pleasures; (2) deviance; (3) lazy ways and inertia; (4) fear and anxiety; (5) doubt and vacillation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, whatever is to be had there,<br />
					of form,<br />
					of experience,<br />
					of perception,<br />
					of own-making,<br />
					of consciousness,</p>

							<p class="f2 in2">(1) Form, (2) experience, (3) perception, (4) own-making, (5) consciousness = the <i>Khandhas.</i> The stockpiled constituents of an existing being. When you <i>'sankhāra'</i> that which you intend to create is stockpiled, awaiting an opportunity to manifest itself. Such opportunity is opened up the instant one takes action. Another way of saying: 'Everything that exists and exists in potentiality as an identified-with component of an existing being.'<br />
							(1) Form <i>(rūpa)</i>: the shape or form or perceptable factor of whatever has become an existing thing, including sounds and other invisible things.<br />
							(2) Experience <i>(vedanā)</i>: This is three things in English: 'experience', 'sense-experience' and 'sensation'. 'Experience' which is for the ordinary person 'sense-experience' and for the arahant 'extra-sensory experience'; 'sense-experience', for the ordinary person experiencing the results of contact of sense-organ with sense-object; and 'sensation,' for the ordinary person, the feeling of pleasure or pain or neither pleasure nor pain (not 'neutral' feeling; this is not a feeling, it is the absence of feeling and is another term for Nibbāna), for the arahant this is only the sensation that is neither pleasant nor painful;<br />
							(3) Perception <i>(saññā)</i>: The first awareness of a thing or the characteristic of a thing; although perception is had only of things which consist of forms and their names, perception is prior to any 'thinking about' or 'pondering of' such things,<br />
							(4) Own-making <i>(sankhāra)</i>: This is identification with the intent to create experience for the self by way of acts of thought, word, and deed and the resulting identified-with experience,<br />
							(5) Consciousness <i>(viññāṇa)</i>: This is knowing that one knows. Conscious awareness. The word literally means re-knowing-knowing-knowledge, which reflects the reality.</p>

					<p class="f4">such things he perceives for himself<br />
					as being changeable,<br />
					painful,<br />
					broken,<br />
					a boil,<br />
					a stab,<br />
					an abyss,<br />
					an affliction,<br />
					'other',<br />
					disintegrating,<br />
					empty,<br />
					not-self.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2">Here we have a simile of an archer who sets up a target (setting up the khandhas as the object of one's thinkiing and pondering) and conscientiously practices to shoot long distances (remembering what was done and said long ago), accurately, and in rapid succession (swift in intuition), and to pierce great masses (the great mass of blindness). There are those who by the use of a simile come to understanding. Others will need to be told that what is being said here is that once the method is understood, it must be put into practice over and over again until one has achieved mastery over it; thinking and pondering over all one is attached to in all the various ways such things can come up and what is necessary to know, see and understand in order to let go of attachment to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he turns his heart away from such things.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus having turned his heart away from such things,<br />
					joins his heart to the state of the deathless<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the peaceful,<br />
					this is the culmination,<br />
					that is to say:<br />
					the calming down of all own-making;<br />
					the laying down of all planning;<br />
					the destruction of hunger/thirst;<br />
					dispassion,<br />
					ending,<br />
					Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">He, taking his stand on this<br />
					arives at the destruction of the corrupting influences.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a follow-up paragraph which states that should one fail at destruction of the corrupting influences using this method, one will nevertheless have created such momentum in practice that one will break the five yokes to rebirth in lower realms and will, upon departing this life without dying, be reborn in a higher realm without birth, spontaneously, and will make an end there. This, of course, if one has made good faith effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Edit [Saturday, February 23, 2019 8:10 AM]: There is in some cases of the description of the First Jhāna, an accompanying simile of a bath attendent or his apprentice taking soap-flakes, (at'za you mind, snow-flake), and in a copper bowl sprinkling them with water (understanding), working them round and round into a ball (repeated practice at bringing some coherance to your mind, in this case focusing on the thrill that accompanies appreciation of solitude), until that soap-ball (your body) is soaked, permeated, suffused and saturated with that thrill that accompanies the First Jhāna.</p>

					Nine perceptions which are of great fruit and of great profit.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Nine Profitable Perceptions</h4>

					<p class="f4">"There are these nine perceptions, beggars,<br />
					which, made a big thing of,<br />
					have great fruit<br />
					are of great advantage;<br />
					lead on to the deathless,<br />
					culminate in the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">What nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">1. Perception of the ugly</p>

							<p class="in2">Bhikkhu Thanissaro would limit this to perception of the uglyness of body. Note this is 'perception' not 'thought of'. You really need to see the uglyness as uglyness. While this is the most important of the ways this perception can be used, it is not the only way. The idea is to break attachment by focusing on the unpleasant feature of a thing. It is especially useful when combating lust by focusing on the things in the lust-object which will drive you crazy the day after. Too fat, too thin, too tall, too short ...</p>

					<p class="f4">2. perception of death,</p>

							<p class="in2">This is the perception that one will die by way of seeing that death is bound up in existence; that once come to existence a thing will pass out of existence. Again, this is not a theoretical understanding, it is the perception of the fact. Look around, see if you can find an object that will not eventually cease to exist. Your perception of death is when you have given up trying to find such a thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. perception of the revolting nature of food,</p>

							<p class="in2">At root this is the perception that whatever it is that one eats, it involved the killing of some living being or many living beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. perception of non-indulgence in all worlds,</p>

							<p class="in2">This is seeing the uselessness of indulging in ambitions (however minor) in a world which is an ending thing. This must be a broad, sweeping perception that encompasses every sort and possibility of existing in any sort of world whatever. Focus on some form of existence ("I want to be a movie star") and then focus on all the disadvantages of that. The primary disadvantage being that one will have no time for Dhamma research and practice, but bring in all the other disadvantages you can imagine. Do this for any occupation in the world that tempts you.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. perception of change,</p>

							<p class="in2">Pay attention to the way things change. Again, not as a theoretical proposition, but as a perception of the reality. Think time-lapse photography. Begin by focusing on things where seeing the change is easy, such as with water, the weather, plant life; then broaden it out into percption of aging in your friends. Marvelous! It appears that I am the only one that does not change.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. perception of pain in change,</p>

							<p class="in2">This is where most people need to get real. It is painful when things do not go your way. It is more painful when they go your way for a time and then change direction. Somewhere in your history there is highly likely someone who has died whose death caused you pain. Focus on that and then generalize out. Inwardly one yearns for rest, stability. What we have in stead is like trying to keep balance on an avalanch. The stress is so constant that it has become like white noise; your job is to see through the block to the reality.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. perception of not-self in the painful</p>

							<p class="in2">This is essentially the perception that if a thing were one's own, it would be under one's control, would not cause us pain because we simply did not want to experience pain, and that 'this' is not under one's control and therefore must not be 'the self' of one should there be such a thing. Then of course there is the deduction that since all that which has come into existence will pass out of existence and because of that be painful, there is nothing there whatever that can rightfully be called the self. Then there is the need to restrain yourself from forming the <b>opinion</b> that there is no self.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. perception of letting go,</p>

							<p class="in2">Just giving up a bad habit is not going to bring you much closer to Nibbana. If you do not examine the situation, you will more than likely just pick up some new bad habit. What you must also do is to perceive the release of tension that follows letting go. Bring yourself to the perception that this thing that has been let go, if not taken up again, cannot in future cause you pain. That perceived is what will motivate you when some of the more difficult things to give up must be given up.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. perception of dispassion</p>

							<p class="in2">Again this is not the intellectual idea that by letting go of thirst one ends pain; it is the perception that when you have let go of any thirst, no pain could result from that.</p>

					<p>In researching another topic I found the following which is Mrs. Rhys Davids discussion of the term 'Pīti' which I quote here in an effort to counter-act the tendency to define this term in only one way (as per Bhk. Thanissaro: 'rapture'). The reason for that being the dissonance between the ease of entering the first <i>jhāna</i> in all other respects versus the difficulty of that if <i>Pīti</i> is described as exclusively 'rapture.'</p>

					<p>From: <i>Dh.S.: A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics,</i> C.A.F. Rhys Davids, trans.: <b>§7:</b> "Pīti, as distinguished from <i>sukhaɱ,</i> is explicitly excluded from the <i>skandha</i> of feeling, considered as the irreducible hedonic constituent, and referred to the composite psychoses of the <i>sankhāra skandha.</i> It connotes emotion, as distinct from bare feeling; that is to say, <i>pīti</i> is a complex psychical phenomenon, implying a "central psycho-physical) origin" and a widely diffused "somatic resonance" (<i>cf.</i> Sully, <i>The Human Mind,</i> ii, 56). It arises out of a present idea, and suffuses the whole being. By Buddhaghosa's day it was divided into five species: the thrill of joy, just causing "the flesh to creep"; the flash of joy, like lightening; the flood of joy, like the breakers on a seashore; ecstasy or transport, in which the subject could float in the air; and overwhelming suffusing joy (<i>Asl.</i> 115, 116). Instances are related of the fourth species <i>(ubbega-pīti),</i> the inspiring idea being <i>"Buddhārammaṇaɱ"</i> (see also <i>Visuddhi Magga,</i> chap. iv; <i>"Yogāvacara's Manual,"</i> vii; <i>Bud. Psy.,</i> 1914, 187 f.) The same word <i>(ubbego)</i> is used to describe the anguish or trembling over guilt discovered."</p>

					<p>Note the commentary classes <i>Pīti</i> not under <i>vedana,</i> but under <i>sankhāra</i> in the <i>khandhas.</i> In other words for the commentators <i>pīti</i> is self-made, intentionally created, not an externally stimulated thing. This much I agree with, but I would suggest that <i>vedana</i> too (as with all the <i>khandhas</i>) is <i>sankhāra</i>'d.</p>

					<p>I do not disagree with Mrs. Rhys-Davids analysis, but think it is not sufficiently wide in scope. I am suggesting the term stands for the spectrum of phenomena that falls between appreciation and rapture.</p>

					<p>Try thinking of the distinction as being between pleasure and the enjoyment of pleasure. The former is a sensation, the latter is a reaction to sensation. So what we have in the first <i>jhāna</i> is 'appreciation of the pleasures born of solitude,' rather than 'pleasure and enjoyment born of solitude'. The 'enjoyment' needs to be shown to be of the pleasure of solitude.</p>

					<p>By the way this raises the issue of posture. It is very important to the arising of the more blissful states of Pīti that one is sitting or standing with one's spine in proper alignment. For tall people, the ability to sit up straight depends greatly on having good upper body strength and strong abdomnal muscles. Good posture used to be one of the things parents taught their children. Not so these days. So train yourselves starting as early as you can! Its important!</p>

					An inspirational story about a Master Giver. It is a non-fiction interview. Although this is about a Christian who has made a vehicle of generosity, it is in no way in conflict with the ideas concerning generosity in the Buddha's system. It may, in these times, seem a bit sappy, but that is not really the case, Dreiser, as interviewer here is sufficiently skeptical. There are many tricks of giving revealed as well as some stories of magic power. Altogether anyone desiring to expand their hearts through generosity would do well to read this short chapter.<br />
					Theodore Dreiser was a little-known, but very influential American novelest writing at the end of the 19th century. He wrote on many levels, but the basic structure was to take the 'young pregnant unmarried mother evicted from her hovel in the depth of winter by the ruthless landlord who in frustrated lust and jealousy ties her up and puts her on the railroad tracks with a train on-coming' style and elevates it to fine art. Every scene in his writing is an examination of human nature.</p>

					A very important sutta! Especially for anyone near death concerned about past kamma cataching up. The Buddha describes how it is that by not doing unskillful deeds (i.e., making any new kamma, any own-making) with mind, speech or body no new consequences will be accumulated; in not doing new deeds, one is placed face-to-face with the results of old deeds and by intelligently resolving all such consequences as they come up one will have eliminated the possibility of painful kammic results coming to one in any future state. As I understand this the proposition is that practicing in this way the results of past deeds are forced to present themselves in this life in that they cannot flow into the future state of a being where no action creating a future identified-with state (own-making, kamma, of thought, word, or deed) exists.<br />

					This is probably the most well-known and most-translated work of the Pali. This translation, one of the very first, has the advantage of being done by a non-Buddhist; it has the disadvantage of being done by a dyed-in-the-wool Sanskrit scholar.<br />
					I don't suppose that academics are actually any more arrogant than any other group of frightened people of limited scope (e.g., politicians, Englishmen), it is just that they have more exposure and are less fearful of their ignorance being exposed. So I suppose we should be grateful that Doc. Müller has graceously allowed that in some cases it may be reasonable for Pali scholars to use the Pali spelling of words in their works, and for that reason he has done so in this work. That said the reader of this translation will find the spelling of many Pali words in need of deciphering because the work was done prior to the establishment of any stable convention concerning diacriticals. I have inserted unicode diacriticals where it appeared harmless.</p>

					A bhikkhu asks for a lesson 'in brief' and gets a lesson in detail. A truly unique sutta which leads to arahantship by a complex mixing of the four <i>brahma viharas,</i> and <i>samādhi</i> practice in the context of <i>satipatthana</i> training. A good sutta to break up the rigid understanding of <i>samādhi</i> and <i>satipaṭṭhana</i> practice.<br />
					This is a very interesting sutta because it gives a step-by-step instruction in meditation practice. It is notable here that while the factors of <i>jhāna</i> are stated, they are all just classed under <i>'samādhi'</i> ('serenity'; Hare, Bhk. Thanisaro, Bhk. Bodhi: 'concentration') and are not put in the usual 1-4 grouping and the term <i>'jhāna'</i> is not mentioned. The method for transitioning out of <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> is inidicated here in a way that is only found in a few suttas: that is, by abandoning one, then the other. Also interesting in this sutta is the way serenity practice is combined with the <i>satipaṭṭānās</i>. Note that this instruction was intended to, and did, <i>result by itself in the hearer, putting it into practice, becoming an arahant</i>.</p>
