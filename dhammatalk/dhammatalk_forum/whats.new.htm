					<p class="ctr">—The Golden Rule</p>

					<p class="f4">A Profitable Lesson in Dhamma</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the student of the Aristocrat ponders:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here am I,<br />
					fond of my life,<br />
					not wanting to die,<br />
					fond of pleasure<br />
					and averse from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose someone should rob me of my life,<br />
					it would not be a thing<br />
					pleasing or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, in my turn,<br />
					should rob of his life<br />
					one fond of his life,<br />
					not wanting to die,<br />
					one fond of pleasure<br />
					and averse from pain,<br />
					it would not be a thing<br />
					pleasing or delightful to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a state that is not pleasant or delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also:<br />
					and a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of such reflection<br />
					he himself abstains<br />
					from taking the life of creatures<br />
					and he encourages others so to abstain,<br />
					and speaks in praise of so abstaining.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should take<br />
					with thievish intent<br />
					what I have not given him,</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should have intercourse with my wives,</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should spoil my fortune<br />
					by lying speech,</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should estrange me from my friends by slander,</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should treat me with harsh speech</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should treat me with pointless, frivolous talk,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I in my turn should so treat him,<br />
					it would not be pleasant or delightful to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a state that is unpleasant,<br />
					not delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also,<br />
					and a state that is not pleasant,<br />
					not delightful to me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">The Mirror of Dhamma</h4>

					<p class="f4">This the 'Mirror of Dhamma,'<br />
					possessed of which the student of the Aristocrat,<br />
					if he please, may himself proclaim of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cut off for me is rebirth in Hell,<br />
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br />
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br />
					the Woeful Way and the Downfall<br />
					Stream-winner am I<br />
					one bound for Awakening!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the student of the Aristocrat has  unwavering faith in the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Lucky Man,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					#1 Self-Awakened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering faith in the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well taught by the Lucky Man<br />
					is the Dhamma,<br />
					to be seen in this visible state,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					a 'come see' thing,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering faith in the Order:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking the walk is the Lucky Man's Order,<br />
					walking rightly,<br />
					walking according to the method,<br />
					walking consummately<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he has the virtues<br />
					dear to the Aristocrat,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted,<br />
					which lead to serenity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is that<br />
					'Mirror of the Dhamma,'<br />
					possessed of which the student of the Aristocrat,<br />
					if he please, may himself proclaim of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cut off for me is rebirth in Hell,<br />
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br />
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br />
					the Woeful Way and the Downfall<br />
					Stream-winner am I<br />

					<p class="f4">Tip: When working on letting go relative to the body, remember that the job is not to relax, but to let go of tensions. Tension is a muscle contraction which has past its point of usefulness. You want to let go of all tensions; if you tried to relax all flexed muscles in the body (which is impossible), you would end up like a plate of spaghetti. The danger here is that you can spend considerable time relaxing this muscle, then that, only after a time noticing that you have been going round and round in a circle, not relieving tensions at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tip: If you are going to use the Dhamma to inform your practice (as opposed to simply following some teacher's guidance), then it becomes very helpful to do your own translations. This does not have to be polished work. The point  is the bearing down on, concentration on the Dhamma (the lesson) within the Dhamma (the instruction). You may not be aware of it, but things change extremely rapidly in our world today and our minds have (or are attempting to) adopt by speeding up and cutting corners, especially when we read. In this is the danger of mentally editing what you are reading such as to form an impression of the lesson which agrees with your pre-conceived notions. If your pre-conceived notions were worth their salt, you would not be in the mess you are in. So you need to open yourself to the possibility that you may have to think through a statement that contradicts a long-cherished belief. That opening to the possibility of new understanding is greatly facilitated by the pondering one must do in translation.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">E-Book Editions<br />
					of the Pali Text Society Translations<br />
					of<br />
					The Four Nikāyas<br />
					<span class="f2">E-pub, Azw, Mobi, and PDF formats</span></h4>

					<p class="f4">Free downloads of the PTS translations of the Four Nikāyas have just been announced by Bhante Bhikkhu Subhuti on his website: <a href="https://americanmonk.org/free-pts-sutta-ebooks/">americanmonk.org</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Please note that this is not a project of BuddhaDust and these publications are not being hosted on this site. These books have been compiled and re-formatted from our as yet [Monday, December 30, 2019 8:15 AM] incompletely proofed html source files by Bhante Bhikkhu Subhuti and Stephen J. Torrence. Some additional editing for spelling has been done by them. Although there remain errors related to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of the original scanned books as well as errors made by me in the haste to get 'something' on line, it was felt by Bhante Subhuti that these files were good enough for release in their current state. There are plans to periodically update these books as editing of the source files continues.</p>

					<p class="f4">Meanwhile this will be, for many people, a more convenient and pleasurable way to read the suttas.</p>

					<p class="f4">To insure that you are downloading the latest version, please downlad from <a href="https://americanmonk.org/free-pts-sutta-ebooks/">americanmonk.org</a></p>

					<p class="f4">I see the release of these e-books, however much they can be improved, as a small miracle. The Dhamma as propagated itself! This is exactly what I would have hoped would happen with the digitization of these suttas. Here is a quick list of some other projects people might find interesting to compile into e-book formats:</p>

					<p class="f4">Healthcare and the Medical Professions;<br />
					Politics;<br />
					Managing Business and Money Management;<br />
					The story of Rahula;<br />
					The story of Migara's Mother;<br />
					The story of Angulimala;<br />
					The story of King Pasanadi;<br />
					The story of Gotama through the suttas;<br />
					The important topics of the Samyutta Nikaya could be made into separate books including suttas on the same subject from all the other Nikayas.<br />
					a collection of all the similes plus their explanations;<br />
					a listing/index (linked), in chronological order, of all the suttas (I believe this information can be gathered from the commentaries),<br />
					and whatever other subjects that are of interest to narow groups.</p>
