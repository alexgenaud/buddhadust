					<p class="f4">Note that the method for inclusion of the Walshe translations that appear just below has been changed from individual files for each sutta to all his translations appearing on one file. These suttas are now included in the <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm">Sutta Index.</a> This was done because there is considerable interaction in the footnotes between suttas in the source document and this was felt to be a more convenient way to manage that. There are several cases where the same and different translations by Walshe appear in the listings together. They come from different sources; mainly from Access to Insight.<br />

					<p class="f4">From the Editor's Preface: <i>"This book is a posthumous publication bought to fruition by a group of the author's devoted pupils. For some, this book will be a treasury of previously unpublished material, shedding novel light on the profound and exacting discourses of the Buddha. It will be intensely provocative for others, querying long-held sentiments and opposing normative modes of Buddhist ideology and application. For others still, the notions expounded in the book will seem heretical to Buddhist tradition, resulting in their dismissal as the views of a recalcitrant monk.<br />
					Wherever the reader's reaction may fall on this spectrum, we trust that investing some time with an open mind could be well worth the labor, particularly for those drawn to the early, pre-sectarian Buddhist theories, practices, and texts."</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have not yet read this book so have no comment to make about it, but as for Venerable Punnjai, I would say that the west, particularly the US ows its current interest in meditation and mindfulnes almost entirely to him. I was there. I was there from the beginning. I saw it happening. I was partly responsible for his first coming to this country. I was one of the first, maybe the first, of his followers. I had many disagrements with him about his use of Pāḷi, very little disagreement with his practice. His contribution to the advancement of Buddhism should not be forgotten.</p>

					The Buddha defines the yokes to rebirth <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsa_myojana"><i>(saṃyojana)</i></a> distinguishing between the object (the senses) and the yoke itself which is desire and lust.<br />
					A very important distinction to get through your head! See also for this idea: <a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.120.wood.pts.htm">SN 3.22.120.</a> It is not the fault of the fairest lass in the land, carelessly dressed, revealing her charms, laughing and singing and dancing, (no matter how much she is trying to make it so), that lust arises in one's heart.

'The eye is the thing grasped, the lust is the grasping." Bhk. Bodhi: 'The eye is a thing that can be clung to, the desire and lust for it is the clinging there.' But I don't think the idea is 'clinging' either in regard to the <i>khandhas</i> or in its place in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i> This word must stand for 'going after or supporting or fueling getting' or 'going towards, supporting, fueling making' not trying to keep, hang on to, what has already been got.<br />

					This translation seems to have left out its center!<br />

					Form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness are inconstant and lustful desire for that which is inconstant should be put away by ending lust for these objects of lustful desire.<br />
					<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xchanda"><i>Chanda-rāgo.</i></a> <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi and Woodward: desire and lust. Since it is possible in <i>Pāḷi</i> to write such a thing as desire <i>and</i> lust were that the intended idea, it seems to me that we should not be translating compounds in this way, but should be seeking to create translations closer in feeling to the idea of a compound. A single idea, not two or three or a half dozen separate ideas.<br />
					Interesting that Bhikkhu Thanissaro should be rendering the term as a compound such as I describe here. I think, though, that in stead of his "desire-passion" I would have used "passionate-desire."<br />

					The Buddha teaches that the things that give rise to what yokes one to rebirth are forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making, and sense-consciousness, whereas the yokes themselves are the wants and desires connected to these things.<br />
					The point is to not think that it is the world that needs to change, but to focus on what it is within one's self that needs to change. It is by teaching the opposite of this lesion that the activist Buddhists lead people astray.</p>
