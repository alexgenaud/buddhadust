					<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p60">AN 10.60</a> The Buddha gives definitions for 'The Ten Perceptions': The idea of discontinuity, of not-self, of the foul, of disadvantages, letting go, dispassion, ending, world-wearyness, of discontinuity in the own-made, of recollection of respriration. In this sutta is a case of 'curing' by way of hearing the Dhamma. Also in this sutta is found a version of what would later become the Satipatthana method.<br />
					In this sutta Bhk. Bodhi translates 'sankhara' both as 'conditioned phenomena' and as 'activities'. The first is simply incorrect (all own-made phenomena are impermanent, but not all conditioned phenomena are impermanent: Nibbāna is conditioned), the second is one-sided and too narrow, the two together are confusing. For the issues raised by the mistranslation of this term see the article: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">'Is Nibbāna Conditioned?'</a><br />

					<h4 class="ctr">Helpful Perceptions</h4>

					<p class="f4">Perception of transience,<br />
					perception of non-self,<br />
					perception of impurity,<br />
					perception of death,<br />
					perception of disadvantage,<br />
					perception of the disgusting nature of food,<br />
					perceiving nothing to delight in in all the world.</p>

					<p class="f2"><i>Saññā.</i> Once knowing. Perception. Not, as per Hare, 'thought'. The idea is the perceiving of impurity, etc., not the thought of impurity, etc. It makes all the difference.</p>
