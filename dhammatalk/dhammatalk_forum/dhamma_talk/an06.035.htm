					<h1>AN 6.35</h1>

					<p>A paticca-samuppada-like progression leading to vision of a method to bring about Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Read the Sutta</p>

					<p class="ctr">Recommended translation: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/06_sixes/an06.035.olds.bd.htm">Constituents of Vision,</a> Olds, trans.<br />
					Index to available translations: <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p35">AN 6.35</a></p>

					<p class="f4">A little six-liner, about which I have written the following in a footnote:</p>

					<p class="f4">The sutta uses the 'causitive' form. But I object on general principles to the whole idea of causation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instability does not cause pain perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">One perceives instability; using that perception of instability one, of one's self, (not 'because of', but 'one is enabled by that to'), perceives pain or maybe not.</p>

					<p class="f4">If instability caused pain-perception everyone would perceive pain; if pain caused not-self-perception everyone would perceive not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If eveyone perceived not self everyone would let go of living, become dispassionate, and bring Pain to an end, snap fingers everyone's an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both Hare's and Bhk. Bodhi's translations suggest the meaning:</p>

					<p class="f4">"the perception that pain is inherent in that which is unstable';</p>

					<p class="f4">'the perception that not-self is inherent in that which is painful'.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are both statements that are consistent with Dhamma, but neither of them are what is being said here in this sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hare's 'the idea of 'ill' <i>in</i> impermanence' misleads in that the letter directs one to an intellectual understanding, not a direct perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is consistent with his translation of <i>'vijja'</i> as 'wisdom' and <i>'saññā'</i> as 'thought', but does not much help one attain the "perceptions" necessary to "see" a method for attaining freedom and does not accurately give the letter which should reflect the idea that the one perception is based on the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi's 'perception of suffering <i>in</i> the impermanent' at least points to the direct perception but it too ignores the letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">The idea of the sutta is a mini-version of the paticca-samuppada: the vision of a method for attaining utter detachment provided by the sequence of perceptions. A progression which insists on there being a relationship of dependence between the six items.</p>

					<p class="f4">Given this,<br />
					that leads to this,<br />
					this leads to that<br />
					and this and this and this.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not 'the constituents of vision are: the perception of instability, and the perception of pain in instability, and the perception of not-self in instability, and the perception of letting go, and the perception of dispassion and the idea of ending;'<br />
					it is<br />
					'the constituents of vision are the perception that the perception of instability leads to the perception of pain which leads to the perception of not-self, the perception of letting go, the perception of dispassion, and the perception of ending.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It's being scatter-brained versus being focused.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one way leaves one saying "OK", the other way leaves one saying "I see!"</p>

					<p class="f4">One of the original names for the Buddhsits was 'vibanghers', 'hair-splitters'; we need to respect that level of precision in our translations. I include me in this caution.</p>
