					<p class="f4">A very enlightening sutta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that Ms. Horner has dared to break with the pack in her translation of <i>'sammā'</i> as 'perfect'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that here is an exposition of the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> which casts each of the factors in the form of the Four Truths which shows both that each of the factors is itself a path to <i>Nibbāna,</i> and that the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> as a whole is a way of stating the Four Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that the commentator numbers the proclamation of the Four Truths in this sutta as thirty-two. I suggest that in addition the entire sutta also counts as one such proclamation, so the number should be thirty-three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that we have here the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> with the <i>'āsavas'</i> the corrupting influences, (Ms. Horner's 'cankers'), preceding the usual 'ignorance' as its starting point.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that here 'craving' <i>'taṇha'</i> is at one point said to be the precursor to the sustenances, and later in the sequence paralleling the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> it is said to be the origin of <i>'upādāna'</i> (Ms. Horner's 'grasping'.) I suggest this is a good argument for the translation of <i>'upādāna'</i> not as 'grasping,' but as 'support' or 'fuel' or an equivalent term.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that under the three <i>saṇkhār</i>ings which I have usually described as of thought, word, and deed, the precise translation would be of body, word, and heart (where 'heart' is <i>'citta',</i> or that work of the heart which has to do with intent and will, and is more specifically associated with individuality than is the more general <i>'mano'</i> or 'mind'). The Buddha's system of <i>'kamma'</i> makes a distinction between a passing thought and thought associated with intent or will. Passing thoughts are not '<i>kammic</i> acts' or <i>saṇkhāras</i> (own-makings).</p>

					<p class="f4">In this sutta we find Lord Chalmers first encounter with the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Some things to note:</p>

					<p class="f4">He translates <i>'upādāna'</i> as 'attachments' where it no doubt lead others to 'grasping', but where it should better be 'supports or fuel'.</p>

					<p class="f4">He translates <i>'bhava'</i> as 'existence' which is unusual and accurate.</p>

					<p class="f4">He translates <i>'saṇkhāra'</i> as 'plastic forces' and goes way afield trying to rationalize this choice. It is very hard when trying to translate what one can see is a very deep and profound system to simply get down to earth in one's translation. Because of this exotic translation, the step from <i>saṅkhāra</i> to consciousness is made obscure. I will clarify:</p>

					<p class="f4">Blindness results in own-making; own-making results in consciousness by way of having brought the sixfold sense sphere (compounds of <i>nāma-rūpa</i>) into existence. The <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> is presented both this way (one instance of 'consciousness') and with two instances of 'consciousness.' #2 being: Blindness results in own-making, own-making results in consciousness, consciousness results in named-form, named form results in consciousness, consciousness results in the six-fold sense-sphere.</p>
