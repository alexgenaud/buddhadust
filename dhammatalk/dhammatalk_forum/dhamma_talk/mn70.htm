					<h1>MN 70</h1>

					<p>Two bhikkhus are taken to task for disparaging the rule about eating at impropper times. Includes a description of Seven sorts of Persons pointing out which have nothing more to do and which have something more to do.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">A very informative sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">It opens with the Buddha introducing the practice of abstaining from food after noon to the Bhikkhus. When this is met with resistance by two of the 'Group of Six' Bhikkhus (whose story runs through the suttas and Vinaya as being a group of Bhikkhus who manage to find the loophole in every new rule) Gotama then delivers a scathing rebuke.</p>

					<p class="f4">Adapted from <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.070.horn.pts.htm">Discourse at Kitagiri,</a> Horner, trans.:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"...even a teacher who sets store on material things, is an heir to material things, and lives in association with material things  — why, even to him, this kind of higgling and haggling does not apply, that his followers will or will not do this or that according as they like it or not.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">... For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and lives in unison with it, monks, it is a principle that:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'The Teacher is the Bhagava, a disciple am I; the Bhagava knows, I do not know.'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and lives in unison with it, monks, the Teacher's instruction is a furthering in growth, giving strength.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">For a disciple who has faith in the Teacher's instruction and lives in unison with it, monks, it ia principel that:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Gladly would I be reduced to skin and sinews and bone and let my  body's flesh and blood dry up if there came to be a vortext of energy so that which is not yet won might be won by human strength, by human energy, by human sttriving.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this Gotama has brought out the reasoning that should be followed in the case of a case where the training initially produces unpleasant sensation, that is, that there are two modes of experiencing sensation, whether pleasant, unpleasant, or not-unpleasant-but-not-pleasant:</p>

					<p class="f4">that which is experienced by the one who is attached to worldly gains,</p>

					<p class="f4">and that which is experienced by the one who is striving after letting the world go.</p>

					<p class="f4">The criteria for judgment is not whether one likes or dislikes the sensation, but whether or not good conditions are increasing and bad conditions are decreasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">(So much for 'if it feels good it's ok' the creed of the common man of the 60's.)</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he mentions the seven states of liberation attainable by one who follows his methods:</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives a definition of each.</p>

					<p class="f4">Following this he gives the proper method for careful striving, also known as <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/title_page.htm">The Gradual Course</a>:</p>
