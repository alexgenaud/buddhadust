					<h1>Separating the Wheat from the Chaff</h1>
						
						<p class="f4">There are those who, declare of a theory of salvation, enlightenment or awakening:</p>
						
								<p class="f4 in2">"This Teaching<br />
								is the Only Real Truth —<br />
								everything else is lies."</p>
								
						<p class="f4">Here, in This Teaching, we do not accept such a statement.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">Here, what we ask ourselves<br />
						is whether those who make such statements in the present,<br />
						actually <i>know and see</i><br />
						of their doctrine proclaiming salvation, enlightenment or awakening that:</p>
						
								<p class="f4 in2">"This Teaching<br />
								is the Only Real Truth —<br />
								everything else is lies."</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Or whether the teachers of those who make such statements,<br />
						or the teachers of their teachers,<br />
						or the originator of that teaching<br />
						actually <i>knew and saw</i><br />
						of that doctrine proclaiming salvation, enlightenment or awakening that:</p>
						
								<p class="f4 in2">"This Teaching<br />
								is the Only Real Truth —<br />
								everything else is lies."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">Here, in This Teaching,<br />
						we examine what the originators of that teaching,<br />
						actually did and said.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Here, in This Teaching,<br />
						we examine what the teachers of that teaching,<br />
						and the proclaimers of that teaching<br />
						actually do and say.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">These five are unreliable bases for making the declaration:</p>
						
								<p class="f4 in2">"This Teaching<br />
								is the Only Real Truth —<br />
								everything else is lies."</p>
						
						<p class="f4"><b>Belief,</b> <i>(Saddhā)</i>,<br />
						<b>it's pleasing appeal,</b> <i>(ruci)</i><br />
						<b>the fact that it follows from what has been heard was the Truth,</b> <i>(anussava)</i>,<br />
						<b>the fact that has been constructed from the pondered over,</b> <i>(ākāra-pari-vitakko),</i><br />
						<b>the fact that it is a view that accords with accepted knowledge,</b> <i>(diṭṭhi-nijjhānakkha)</i>.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Why?</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Because a thing believed to be true may be false;<br />
						and a thing believed to be false may be true.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Beliefs that please may be false;<br />
						and beliefs that displeases may be true.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Things which follow from what has been heard was the Truth may be false;<br />
						things which do not follow from what has been heard was the Truth may be true.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Things which are in accord with accepted knowledge may be false;<br />
						things which are contrary to accepted knowledge may be true.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">Belief in a Truth,<br />
						being pleased with it,<br />
						passing a doctrine along,<br />
						ponderiing it well,<br />
						and causing it to be accepted knowledge<br />
						serve as ways of <i>preserving a Teaching.</i></p>
						
						<p class="f4">Simply because a Teaching has been preserved<br />
						is not sufficient to justify making the declaration:</p>
						
								<p class="f4 in2">"This Teaching<br />
								is the Only Real Truth —<br />
								everything else is lies."</p>
								
						<p class="f4">For the statement to be made of a Teaching that:</p>
						
						      <p class="f4 in2">"Well taught is this Dhamma by an Awakened One<br />
								who saw for himself,<br />
						      teaching it afterwords to men and gods.<br />
						      A saving, enlightening, awakening Dhamma.<br />
						      A thing to be known and seen for one's self by the intelligent,<br />
						      with results visible in this world,<br />
						      not a matter of Time.<br />
						      helpful in the beginning,<br />
						      helpful in the middle,<br />
						      helpful at the end,<br />
						      a liberating thing,<br />
						      leading onwards to dispassion,<br />
						      letting go, giving up<br />
						      culminating in the complete destruction of pain<br />
								deathlessness, freedom, utter detachment, Nibbāna."</p>
								
						<p class="f4">There must also be<br />
						<i>awakening to it's truth.</i></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">For awakening to the truth of a Teaching<br />
						one must examine it's originator or it's teacher<br />
						concering three states:</p>

						<p class="f4">States of greed <i>(lobha)</i><br />
						States of hate, <i>(dosa)</i><br />
						States of confusion <i>(moha)</i><br />
						thus:</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Does, or did this teacher exibit<br />
						through his speach and bodily actions<br />
						such evidence of greed in his mind<br />
						that he would say he knew and saw<br />
						when he did not know and see?</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Or would he be capable<br />
						because of greed<br />
						of leading others to courses of action<br />
						which would be harmful to them?</p>
						
						<p class="f4">If upon examination it is found<br />
						that that person's speech accords with his actions<br />
						and this conduct is not that of a greedy person,<br />
						and that that person's teaching is deep, subtle, leads to stilling, calming and tranquilizing the mind and body;<br />
						is reasonable, wise, peaceful;<br />
						leading on to letting go of harmful, low, common, un-dignified, unaristocratic states<br />
						and the attaining of utter freedom of detachment;<br />
						not something that could be taught by the greedy,<br />
						then he should examine that teacher as to states of hate.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">If upon examination it is found<br />
						that that person's speech accords with his actions<br />
						and this conduct is not that of a person full of hate,<br />
						and that that person's teaching is deep, subtle, leads to stilling, calming and tranquilizing the mind and body;<br />
						is reasonable, wise, peaceful;<br />
						leading on to letting go of harmful, low, common, un-dignified, unaristocratic states<br />
						and the attaining of utter freedom of detachment;<br />
						not something that could be taught by one who hates,<br />
						then he should examine that teacher as to states of confusion.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
						
						<p class="f4">Does, or did this teacher exibit<br />

						and the attaining of utter freedom of detachment;<br />
						not something that could be taught by one is confused,<br />
						then one may reasonably place faith in that individual.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">To this extent<br />
						there is the method of separating the wheat from the chaff,<br />
						but there is not yet awakening<br />
						to knowing and seeing this Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">Placing faith in This Dhamma and This Teacher;<br />
						one should approach this Dhamma;<br />
						approaching,<br />
						one should pay attention;<br />
						paying attention,<br />
						one should listen carefully;<br />
						listening carefully,<br />
						one will hear the details of this Dhamma;<br />
						hearing this Dhamma,<br />
						one should remember what has been heard;<br />
						what one has remembered<br />
						should be pondered in mind<br />
						and tested by implementation<br />
						in one's thoughts, words and deeds;<br />
						through testing the Dhamma,<br />
						one will see it's veracity;<br />
						seeing the truth of this Dhamma,<br />
						one will approve of it;<br />
						approving, one will be pleased;<br />
						pondering the results,<br />
						approving of the results,<br />
						pleased,<br />
						one redoubles one's effort,<br />
						exerts one's self whole-heartedly,<br />
						becomes resolved on attainment;<br />
						become resolved on attainment,<br />
						one realizes the Dhamma,<br />
						knowing it and seeing it for one's self<br />
						by having penetrated it<br />
						through the knowledge, wisdom and vision<br />
						generated by this method.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">To this extent he can say:</p>
						
						      <p class="f4 in2">"I know, I see."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">To this extent what has been accomplished<br />
						is awakening to knowing and seeing This Dhamma,<br />
						but it cannot yet be said<br />
						that there is attainment of the goal of This Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">For the attainment of the goal of This Dhamma<br />
						there must be walking-the-talk,<br />
						making it an encompasing reality,<br />
						that which follows from This Dhamma must be unbroken in practice.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In a word,<br />
						one must become Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

						<p class="f4">In the service of walking-the-talk,<br />
						making it real,<br />
						unbroken practice,<br />
						becoming Dhamma,<br />
						is starting;</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of starting<br />
						familiarity.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of familiarity<br />
						is pondering and evaluation;</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of pondering and evaluation,<br />
						is exertion.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of exertion,<br />
						is desire to attain.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of desire to attain,<br />
						is approval of This Dhamma.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of approval of This Dhamma,<br />
						is testing the truth.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of testing the truth,<br />
						is remembering This Dhamma.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of remembering This Dhamma,<br />
						is knowledge of This Dhamma.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of knowledge of This Dhamma,<br />
						is lending a ready ear.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of lending a ready ear<br />
						is paying careful attention.</p>
						
						<p class="f4">In the service of paying careful attention<br />
