						<h1>All Things Considered</h1>

							<p class="f4">If Asked:<br />
							'What, friend, is the root of all things?<br />
							What brings all things to life?<br />
							What is the support of all things?<br />
							What is the confluence of all things?<br />
							What is at the interface of all things?<br />
							Ruled over by what are all things?<br />
							Directed at what are all things?<br />
							What is at the heart of all things?<br />
							What is the pitfall of all things?<br />
							What is the end of all things?'</p>

							<p class="f4">Properly answered, the answers would be:<br />
							Wanting is the root of all things, friend.<br />
							Work of mind brings all things to life.<br />
							Contact supports all things.<br />
							All things converge in sense experience.<br />
							Serenity is at the interface of all things.<br />
							Ruled over by mind are all things.<br />
							Directed at wisdom are all Dhammas.<br />
							Freedom is at the heart of all Dhammas.<br />
							Falling into the deathless are all Dhammas.<br />
							Ending in Nibbāna are all Dhammas.</p>
