					<h1>AN 6.42</h1>
					
					<p>The Buddha explains to Nagita, his attendant, his refusal to accept homage by a series of images progressively pointing out the disadvantages of proximity to society and the advantages of solitude.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Read the Sutta</p>
					
					<p class="ctr">Index to available translations: <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p42">AN 6.42</a></p>
					
					<p class="f4">See also: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.086.hare.pts.htm">AN 8.86</a>, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/05_fives/an05.030.hare.pts.htm">AN 5.30</a><br />
					Hare's translation of the end of this sutta does not make sense. He has:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But when walking along the highway, Nāgita,<br />
					I see nothing whatever in front nor behind,<br />
					it suits me,<br />
					even over the calls of nature.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Pali: <i>Yasmāhaɱ Nāgita samaye addhānamaggapaṭipanno na kañci passāmi purato vā pacchato vā,||
					phāsu me Nāgita tasmiɱ samaye hoti antamaso uccārapassāvakammāyā" ti.</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">MO: At such a time, Nāgita, as I am walking along the highway
					and there is no one whatsoever to be seen either ahead or behind,
					I am comfortable at such a time even in passing water and passing matter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhk. Bodhi also mis-reads the situation:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When, Nāgita I am traveling on a highway and do not see anyone ahead of me or behind me, even if it is for the purpose of defecating and urinating, on that occasion I am at ease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhk. Thanissaro has the sense of it:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But when I am traveling along a road and see no one in front or behind me, at that time I have my ease, even when urinating and defecating.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The sutta is about the advantages of solitude over the enjoyments of gains, favors and flattery and this is about as strong a statement as can be made concerning such.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Put yourself in the position of a king, or famous person, constantly surrounded by a following, who finds himself needing to ... um ... answer the calls of nature.</p>
