					<p class="f4">Note in this sutta the distinction being made between <i>'sata'</i> and <i>'sampajāno.'</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'Sata'</i> (being recollected, having remembrance (pp of <i>sarati</i> = to remember (not precisely identical with <i>'sati'</i> as Woodward, Bhk. Thanissaro, Bhk. Bodhi would have it; the difference being that <i>sata</i> is more directly connected with the idea of memory or recall where <i>sati</i> is more directly connected with the putting to use of the recollected)) is defined as while living in body, sense-experience, the heart, and the <i>Dhamma,</i> over-seeing body, sense-experience, the heart, and <i>Dhamma</i> and is exactly the product of the four settings up of memory which includes <i>'sampajāno'</i> (comprehension), and <i>'sati'</i> (to mind, minding) and involves the task of energetically eliminating greed and depression.</p>

					<p class="f4">Comprehension <i>'Sampajāno'</i> is defined as the <i>'viditā'</i> (the seeing = knowing = finding out = dis-covery = wise as in 'I'm wise to that') of the rise ('Keep that tool cool fool, I'm wise to that rise in your Levi's'), manifestation, and resolution of sense-experience, word-thought and perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-experience is the sensation (of pleasure, pain, or sensation that is neither painful nor pleasant) arising from the experience of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and awareness of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Word thought (<i>vitakka</i> = re-talking) is thoughts formed by words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception (<i>saññā</i> = once-knowing) is the first point of conscious awareness where what is sensed (come into contact with the senses) has first had a name placed on it, that is, has been identified.</p>

					<p class="f4">So putting it together we can say that being recollected means that one, while living in the body, sense-experience, heart (or mental states) or the <i>Dhamma</i> should over-see (that is observe and take care of) the body, sense-experience, the heart, and the <i>Dhamma,</i> with great energy (<i>ātāpi</i>), comprehending in connection with body, sense-experience, heart and the <i>Dhamma</i> the rise, manifestation, and resolution of sense-experience, word-thought and perception, such as to eliminate worldly greed and depression.</p>

					<p class="f4">... and all this with regard to the self or external things or both the self and external things together.<br />
					... and further, all this only just to the degree that one is conscious that 'this is body', 'this is sense-experience,' 'this is the heart', 'this is <i>Dhamma.</i>'</p>
