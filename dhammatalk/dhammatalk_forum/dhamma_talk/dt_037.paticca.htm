					<p class="f4">What it isn't is 'cause', no more than the mother 'causes' the birth of her child. The child comes into existence as a consequence of the conjoining of inumerable factors, some of which are vital, some of which can be controlled by choice. When the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada</i> is given in the reverse direction indicating the path to the ending of pain, the factors presented are those which are vital, salient, comprehensible, visible and at some point in the chain under the control of the individual.</p>
