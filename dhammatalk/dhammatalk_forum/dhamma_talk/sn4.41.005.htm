					<h1>SN 4.41.5</h1>
					
					<p>Citta gives his solution to a riddle posed by the Venerable Kamabhu.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Read the Sutta</p>
					
					<p class="ctr">Index of Available translations: <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_41_cittasamyutta.htm#p5">SN 4.41.5</a></p>

					      <p class="fp4 in2"><i>Nelaŋgo setapacchādo||<br />
							ekāro vattatī ratho</i>|| ||</p>

							<p class="fp4 in2"><i>Anīghaṃ passa āyantaṃ||<br />
							chinnasotaṃ abandhananti.</i>|| ||</p>

							<p class="f4">My translation and solution:</p>

      					<p class="f4 in2">Straight, transparent,<br />
							built here, rolling on —<br />
							the chariot —<br />
							see it smoothly guided<br />
							beyond the stream,<br />
							unbound.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Straight = ethical<br />
							transparent = without deceit, open, visible (covered in white would point to a layman which is unlikely)<br />
							built here = the set-up mind<br />
							rolling on = <i>saŋsara,</i> but also rolling on to the ending of <i>saŋsara</i><br />
							chariot = the own-made, the personal vehicle<br />
							smoothly guided = steared without the corrupting influences<br />
							beyond the stream = with thirst cut off<br />
							unbound = cut free of, losed, released.</p>

							<p class="f4">Since Citta's solution was not confirmed by the Buddha, and Kāmabhū may not have understood the solution himself (that is that he may have been asking Citta for a solution rather than posing the riddle (but see the next sutta [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_41_cittasamyutta.htm#p6">SN 4.41.6</a>] where it appears that Kāmabhū is in fact a knowledgable bhikkhu who is instructing Citta);  — Kāmabhū does not actually say that Citta's solution is correct or in accordance with a solution given by the Buddha ... his remark to Citta may well have been a polite 'maybe.' Or it may be that Citta's solution, although not what he had in mind was nevertheless fair Dhamma and so he let it pass.), I believe we are free to arrive at a different solution. My translation 'turns' on making the riddle both a description of the proper chariot and an instrucion as to what to do with it. If <i>'ekāro'</i> must be 'one-spoked' or 'one-wheeled' we can hear in that the sound of one hand clapping and not be too upset. Nizamis' solution is as forced as mine but more academically couched. (There is no √<i>&#7771;</i> in Pali; it would be √kar = 'make'. But there are those who believe Sanskrit to be the root language of Pali. May they go in peace, make of it what they will.)<i>(lidda didjadijajijjajok-khahaha)</i></p>

							<p class="f4">See on this <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.041-050.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.1.46">SN 1.1.4</a> where: straight = the name the Road is called;<br />
							Free-from-fear = the destination;<br />
							'Silent Runner' = the name of the Chariot;<br />
							the wheels = Righteous Effort;<br />
							the 'leaning board' = Conscience;<br />
							the drapery = Heedfulness;<br />
							the driver = the Dhamma;<br />
							those that run before = Right Views (important persons traveled with troops in front and in back)</p>

							<p class="f4">Again see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.004.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.45.5</a> where the wheels are energy, the axle is enthusiasm (possibly the intent of <i> ekāro</i>, that is, one-axled); the drapery is desirlessness, and the car is 'built by self'.</p>

							<p class="f4">There seems to be a great deal of flexibility in giving meanings to the components of the chariot.</p>
