					<h1>MN 128</h1>
					
					<p>The Buddha is not able to halt the argument and contention of the sangha in Ghosita's vihara in Kosambī and so moves on to Visit Bhago in Balakallonakara village where he teaches him Dhamma and then he visits the Anuruddhas staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove there. There he teaches the Anuruddhas in great detail the process of eliminating the obstructions to clairvoyant sight and describes the method of jhana practice in threes which he himself used to attain arahantship.<br />
					An absolutely invaluable sutta when it comes to developing insight, clairvoyance and the jhanas.<br />
					It is here that we see the actual meditation method used by Gotama: The 'method in threes':</p>
