						<div class="inner">					
						
						<p>The first inderstands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is Pain" immediately upon hearing it.<br />
						The second understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is Pain" upon figuring out that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> includes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness.<br />
						The third understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is Pain" upon being instructed again and again that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> includes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness, and that this group of terms encompasses all that which is understood to be a living, existing being, and that birth, aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair; not getting what is wished-for; getting what is not wished-for; in a word, that the entire stockpile of temptations (form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness) is a heap of flaming du-k-kha.<br />
						The fourth type is able only to repeat that in the Buddhism that is taught on this site, what is taught is that "This is pain" and that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> is said to include form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness, and that this group of terms encompasses all that which is understood to be a living, existing being, and that birth, aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair; not getting what is wished-for; getting what is not wished-for; in a word, that the entire stockpile of temptations (form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness) is a heap of flaming du-k-kha.</p>
