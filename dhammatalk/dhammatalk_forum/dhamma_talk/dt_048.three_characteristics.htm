					<p class="f4"><b>Note well</b> the distinction made in the construction between the first and the second and the third. It will become very important to understand when it comes to understanding the state of the Arahant and <i>Nibbāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Nibbāna</i> is a <i>dhamma,</i> meaning a thing, with 'thing' being understood as just a place holder for an idea, not a concrete phenomena to be found somewhere in existence. If all things were unstable and painful, <i>Nibbāna</i> would not be <i>Nirvana.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If only own-made things were not-self, that would allow for the possibility of the not-own-made being the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">See the discussion: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is <i>Nibbāna</i> Conditioned</a> Note there the reasons for objecting to the translation of <i>saṅkhāra</i> as conditioning. For discussion of the last term see:</p>

					In each the Buddha describes five factors which assure good results from hearing <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The reader will note that there is considerable difference between my translation and that of Hare or Bhk. Bodhi. The key word to understand is <i>'Sammatta'</i> This is one of those words that I say comes down from the oldest forms of <i>Pāḷi</i> and is a <i>Manta,</i> or magic charm.</p>

					<p class="f4">PED has it broken into two forms, one as <i>saṁ + matta,</i> meaning 'with madness' or intoxicated, delighted, etc., but also (unmentioned) 'with measure'; and the other as abstracted from <i>sammā</i> meaning 'correctness,' 'righteousness' (I say 'High' or 'Consummate') and then defining that as the <i>Magga.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I suggest the meaning is derived from an earlier form incorporating all those meanings: extatic (ecstatic) intoxication: "A High Measure of Madness," "divine madness." The thing is that this word here stands alone and is otherwise undefined in the <i>Suttas</i> and the method I have found to be most productive of insight when trying to understand suttas is to take them at face value. To insert, without justification the idea that this word means (rather than is something that results from) the Eightfold Path, seems to me to be going too far. We have too many suttas (<i>e.g.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.46.052.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.46.52</a>) which teach methods for attaining arahantship which do not rely on the <i>formal</i> Eightfold Path (what is relied upon may amount to the same thing, but it is not so stated). I see no problem with the idea that what is being spoken of is religious extasy (ecstasy) or, if you would prefer a measured enthusiasm.</p>
