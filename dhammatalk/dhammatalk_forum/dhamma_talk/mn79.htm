					<p>In an encounter with the Wanderer Sakuludayi, the Buddha explains what it is in his system that constitutes perfection and which is the state beyond bliss that his followers attain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ms. Horner has messed up in this translation a few of the most essential points, and better solutions have been noted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin is visited by Gotama. He first asks for an explanation as to why Nātaputta the Jain faultered when asked a question. Gotama answers with the statement that those who know and see the past and the future would not falter and then he teaches Udāyin the paticca samuppada in brief:</p>

					<p class="f4">If this is,<br />
					that comes to be;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises;<br />
					if this is not,<br />
					that does not come to be;<br />
					from the stopping of this,<br />
					that is stopped.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not understood by Sakuludāyin, who states that he would be better able to discuss a teaching of his own teachers, namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the highest lustre,<br />
					this is the highest lustre.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama points out that this does not reveal much, and when Sakuludāyin, does finally get around to explaining what 'this' is, he does so with a simile.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama then in a towering series of comparisons forces Sakuludāyin, to realize that he has, as well as having said that this 'this' he is speaking of has less lustre than a glow worm, has still not actually pointed out what that 'this' is. And Sakuludāyin, admits to being completely defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again when questioned about another doctrine of his teachers' — that of a world exclusively pleasureable and a path for attaining that world — his teacher's doctrine is shown to be incapable of realizing that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, shown the real path to that world, and asking if this is the goal for which people follow him, Gotama explains the real goal for which people follow him. A condition beyond sense pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">[It is interesting to note here that Sakuludāyin's followers raise a ruckus at the point where this path is given. This path consists of the first three of the four <i>jhānas,</i> and Sakuludāyin's followers say that they do not have any experience of anything <i>beyond</i> this. Since what is being spoken of is their ancient tradition, the implication is that at least these three <i>jhānas</i> were known prior to the Buddha's enlightenment. But apparently the commentary goes even further and suggests that at one time the attainment of this world (which is via the fourth <i>jhāna</i>) was once known by this group but had been forgotten. So all four <i>jhānas</i> were apparently known before Gotama. One wonders then what it was that was special about the use of <i>jhāna</i> by Gotama that lead him to awakening.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Sakuludāyin, is convinced, but is disuaded from entering the order by his followers.</p>
