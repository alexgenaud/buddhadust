						<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="na" href="#fna">a</a>]</sup> <i>Samudaya.</i> Own-arising = Arising as own-this or that. I have said that no other translator has recognized the 'sam' in this word, but this is not correct. Bhk. Thanissaro periodically but not in the case of SN 4.35.204, has 'co-arising' (but I am not sure what he has in mind with/by this translation: 'co' = 'with', but with what? It has arisen, consequent upon thirst, as a result of the intent to experience some experience of some individual; it arises attached to the notion 'my' or 'I am'.). Most translators use just 'arising' or 'origination', but this misses the vital information that this 'arising' is the arising of a thing in the shape of something of one's own.</p>
