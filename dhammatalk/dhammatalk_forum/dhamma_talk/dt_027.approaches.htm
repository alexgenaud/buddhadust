						<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="na" href="#fna">a</a>]</sup> <i>Samudaya.</i> Own-arising = Arising as my-this or that. I have said that no other translator has recognized the <i>'sam'</i> in this word, but this is not correct. Bhk. Thanissaro periodically but not in the case of SN 4.35.204, has 'co-arising' (but I am not sure what he has in mind with/by this translation: 'co' = 'with', but with what? It has arisen, consequent upon thirst, as a result of the intent to experience some experience of some individual; it arises attached to the notion 'my' or 'I am'). Most translators use just 'arising' or 'origination', but this misses the vital information that this 'arising' is the arising of a thing in the shape of something of one's own, or, alternatively, and amounting to the same thing, arising by itself, but identified-with as one's own.</p>
