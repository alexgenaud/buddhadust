						      <p class="f4 in2">Six worldly situations resulting from detachment</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the ordinary common person, having seen a shape with the eye, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Not having seen the danger in and not having overcome desire for pleasurable sights, the detachment that arises is the detachment of the worldly. Such detachment is a mental state; dependent on seeing worldly shapes which are impermanent and therefore it is itself impermanent. Such detachment carries with it the underlying tendency to blindness followed by desires which result in conjuring up (upadana) ways to get such, which results in existence, birth, aging, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the ordinary common person, having heard a sound with the ear, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Not having seen the danger in and not having overcome desire for pleasurable sounds, the detachment that arises is the detachment of the worldly. Such detachment is a mental state; dependent on hearing worldly sounds which are impermanent and therefore it is itself impermanent. Such detachment carries with it the underlying tendency to blindness followed by desires which result in conjuring up (upadana) ways to get such, which results in existence, birth, aging, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the ordinary common person, having smelled a scent with the nose, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience.

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the ordinary common person, having tasted a savour with the tongue, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Not having seen the danger in and not having overcome desire for pleasurable tastes, the detachment that arises is the detachment of the worldly. Such detachment is a mental state; dependent on tasting worldly savours which are impermanent and therefore it is itself impermanent. Such detachment carries with it the underlying tendency to blindness followed by desires which result in conjuring up (upadana) ways to get such, which results in existence, birth, aging, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the ordinary common person, having felt a contact with the body, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Not having seen the danger in and not having overcome desire for pleasurable contacts, the detachment that arises is the detachment of the worldly. Such detachment is a mental state; dependent on feeling worldly contacts which are impermanent and therefore it is itself impermanent. Such detachment carries with it the underlying tendency to blindness followed by desires which result in conjuring up (upadana) ways to get such, which results in existence, birth, aging, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the ordinary common person, having had consciousness of a thing with the mind, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Not having seen the danger in and not having overcome desire for pleasurable states of consciousness, the detachment that arises is the detachment of the worldly. Such detachment is a mental state; dependent on being conscious of worldly things which are impermanent and therefore it is itself impermanent. Such detachment carries with it the underlying tendency to blindness followed by desires which result in conjuring up (upadana) ways to get such, which results in existence, birth, aging, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>

						      <p class="f4 in2">Six world-abandoning situations resulting from detachment</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the well educated student of the Aristocrat having seen a shape with the eye, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Seeing the impermanence of shapes seen with the eye and realizing that past, future or present, all shapes are impermanent and ultimately painful, he experiences the detachment of the world-abandoning. Such detachment goes beyond this world to detachment from all that which has been own-made.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the well educated student of the Aristocrat having heard a sound with the ear, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Seeing the impermanence of sounds heard with the ear and realizing that past, future or present, all sounds are impermanent and ultimately painful, he experiences the detachment of the world-abandoning. Such detachment goes beyond this world to detachment from all that which has been own-made.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the well educated student of the Aristocrat having smelled a scent with the nose, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Seeing the impermanence of scents smelled with the nose and realizing that past, future or present, all scents are impermanent and ultimately painful, he experiences the detachment of the world-abandoning. Such detachment goes beyond this world to detachment from all that which has been own-made.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the well educated student of the Aristocrat having tasted a savour with the tongue, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Seeing the impermanence of savours tasted with the tongue and realizing that past, future or present, all savours are impermanent and ultimately painful, he experiences the detachment of the world-abandoning. Such detachment goes beyond this world to detachment from all that which has been own-made.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the well educated student of the Aristocrat having felt a contact with the body, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Seeing the impermanence of contacts felt with the body and realizing that past, future or present, all contacts are impermanent and ultimately painful, he experiences the detachment of the world-abandoning. Such detachment goes beyond this world to detachment from all that which has been own-made.</p>

								      <p class="f4 in4">To the well educated student of the Aristocrat having cognized a thing with the mind, there arises not-painful-but-not-pleasant experience. Seeing the impermanence of things cognized with the mind and realizing that past, future or present, all things are impermanent and ultimately painful, he experiences the detachment of the world-abandoning. Such detachment goes beyond this world to detachment from all that which has been own-made.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a diversity of detachments where detachment is situated on the diverse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Such is detachment from shape,<br />
					      such is that from sound<br />
					      such is that from scent<br />
					      such is that from savour<br />
					      such is that from contact</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><i>Note that in this case there is no detachment situated on the mind. Such a thing is not possible. This sort of detachment is detachment while still identifying with a self and that, being an idea in the mind, precludes detachment from the mind.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is a single sort of detachment where detachment is situated on that which is not based on diversity of perception:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Such is detachment from the Realm of Endless Space-situated;<br />
					      such is that from the Realm of Endless Consciousness-situated;<br />
					      such is that from the Realm of No Things Had There-situated;<br />
							such is that from the Realm of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception-situated.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2"><i>In this case the nature of the detachment is the same for each situation because the nature of each situation on which that detachment is based is the same: abandoning. The Realm of Endless Space, for example is arrived at by  wholly transcending perception of material shapes, by the settling down of perception of sensory reactions, by not attending to perception of variety, thinking: 'Space is unending,'; the Realm of Endless Consciousness is arrived at by abandoning the Realm of Endless Space, etc. Said another way, there is detachment attached to 'things' (equanimity) which changes from thing to thing, and there is detachment from all things which is based on the single process that is abandoning.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Using the single detachment singly-situated,<br />
					abandon diversity detachment diversity-situated.</p>

					<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p152">MN 152.</a> The Buddha instructs Ānanda on the attitude which should be developed with regard to the sense organs, their objects, and the sensations and emotions arising from sense experience. He then describes it as a power of one who has so developed his sense faculties that he can, at will live with whatever attitude and perceptions he may wish among both the ugly and the beautiful.</p>
