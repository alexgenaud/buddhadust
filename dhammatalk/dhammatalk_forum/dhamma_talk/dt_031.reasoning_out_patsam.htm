									High View: the view that this is pain, that it originates with hunger and thirst, that it can only be brought to an end by eliminating the hunger and thirst, and that the way to do that is High View, High Principles, High Talk, High Works, High Lifestyle, High Self-control, High Mind, and High Serenity;<br />
									High Principles: Letting go, no mental cruelty, non- Violence;<br />
									High Talk: abstention from lies, slander, abusive speech;<br />

									High Self-control: Making an Effort, seeking to get rid of bad states, keep off bad states, obtain good states, retain good states;<br />
									High Mind: Awareness of the arising, maintaining, and passing off of body, sense-experience, states of mind, and the Dhamma such that one abandons all anger and unhappiness, is satisfied, and above it all.<br />
									High Serenity: By rising above sense pleasures and unskillful things, entering into and making a habitat of appreciation of the peace of solitude; the peace of meditation, ease, and detachment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Mano.</i> There are numerous forms of 'mind', and the word can indicate the unidentified-with mind of the Arahant. Here the term is qualified by it's inclusion as a sense-sphere as being the mind of an identified-with, existing being.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Consciousness. Here this is just the fact of consciousness. Consciousness as a phenomena. Like 'Mind', there are many forms of consciousness, each depending on it's object. Consciousness does not arise without having an object of it's awareness. If consciousness arises in conjunction with consciousness of an unidentified-with (un own-made) named-form it is called 'the unseen consciousness) which is a term for the consciousness of the Arahant and is an equivalent of Nibbāna. Who made the un-identified-with named form? Someone else. This 'unidentified=with consciousness' arises with consciousness that the object is not own-made as it's object.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Own-making. In different words, an 'identified-with consciousness of existince as named-form' (i.e., an already existing conscious living being) acts with intent to create identified-with experience by bringing together in thought: consciousness, name and form. So we can say that 'named-form created consciousness' and 'consciousness created named-form'. Conceiving in mind a desired object and taking steps by way of thought, word and deed to obtain that object; that object being realized (being made up from named forms) there is consciousness arising from that situation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> "is there no". This statement is absolute and relative. It would be that if there were 'no' anywhere there would be 'no' anywhere; but directed at the individual this means: "if you personally had no/did no". "If there were in you no" etc.</p>
