					<h1>What is Two?</h1>

					<p class="f3 in4">There are these two things, which, when seen to their root and understood to their broadest limits with penetrating knowledge such that their nature as Pain is seen as it really is and when realized in their entirety, bring the Freedom of Uttermost Detachment.</p>

					<p class="f3 in4">What are those two?</p>

					<p class="f3 in4">Nama and Rupa.</p>

					<p class="f2 in4">— AN 10.27, 28 and SN 4.41.8</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">I Here Tell, once upon a time the two unknown friends, OBO, residing in California, and GS, residing in New Jersey, held approximately the following conversation using electronic mail messaging — some editing has been done in piecing together the originals in terms of content and sequence:</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:] Hello Obo! Can you give me some information about the terms nama/rupa and their relationship to consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] Well asked GS! This is an excellent question in a case of vital importance!</p>

					<p class="f4">Definitions:</p>

					<p class="f4">Nama. In your thinking use 'name'. That is the term with the best resonance in your mind. It is very much like our understanding of perception. It is the having been identified state of a form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rupa. In your thinking use 'form'. It is the having come into a recognizable (nameable) form of light. The literal meaning of 'rupa' is light. That is the furthest-reduced state of matter. So the term also means matter. And that includes things like ideas and sounds, etc. So there will be confusion when you read about the a-rupa (non-rupa) states. But that ideas are included in forms is clear when ideas can be seen as series of identified forms. Emotions as series of ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vinnana. In your thinking use 'individualized consciousness' 'identified-with consciousness'. The consciousness experienced by an individual. Self-consciousness. The consciousness of a being, conscious of being conscious. The literal meaning is VI = RE; and a mess of 'nas' all of which mean knowing. Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge. It is the knowing of knowing. The word reflects the experience. When you get very calm you will see that what we call consciousness is a stream of 'images' repeated over and over too many times to count building up a picture/idea/story/episode. Can be very annoying. This perception is the real meaning of Vitaka and Vicara. You need to rise above this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In any state that has become, the three cannot be separated. They are interdependent.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the translations, and perhaps in the original talks of Gotama (for the good reason that it is almost better left un-discussed — discovered by practice rather than learned about — there is little overt distinction made between the consciousness of the ordinary individual and the consciousness of the Arahant. However, once the notion that there is a distinction is accepted, it appears all over the place. In some places it is given the name: <a href="dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm#vinnana">anidassana vinnana</a>. Invisible consciousness. A = not; NI = down, put down; dassa = seeing; na =knowing. Knowing that cannot be pinned down.</p>

					<p class="f4">You can find this addressed in many places, but most recently in a translation by Bhk. Thanissaro on ati: MN 38 where his footnotes show an excellent example of dhamma-research.</p>

					<p class="f4">This sutta deals with 'Sati's problem'. His thinking being that consciousness — meaning individualized consciousness — is continuous and is what gets reborn. That is denied and it is explained that THAT consciousness is constructed, depends on nama/rupa and is therefore not the self nor does it transmigrate as it arises in dependence on that which ends and perishes when that on which it depends perishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is also spoken of in the sutta that declares: "This mind is pure, but is corrupted from without;" and in the series of suttas which begin with Ānanda asking Sariputta if there was really a world beyond in which one was unaware of such and yet one was aware to which the answer was 'yes'.</p>

					<p class="f4">N.B. The final way explained as the way a monk's winning of concentration should be. This should not be taken figuratively.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the perception itself!</p>

					<p class="f4">That is: "This is the real, etc." should be the perception you have there and your attitude towards it of the detached state.</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Monk, the four great existents (earth, water, fire, and wind) are the cause, the four great existents the condition, for the delineation of the aggregate of form.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Contact is the cause, contact the condition, for the delineation of the aggregate of feeling.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Contact is the cause, contact the condition, for the delineation of the aggregate of perception.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Contact is the cause, contact the condition, for the delineation of the aggregate of fabrications.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Name-and-form is the cause, name-and-form the condition, for the delineation of the aggregate of consciousness."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">That which gives the illusion of existence is the five aggregates of clinging.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">— Bhk. Thanissaro</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] I have trouble here first off with the term: 'existents'. All our problems come up from the notion of 'existence'. Buddhism does not argue existence or non-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four are usually termed 'dhatu' our 'data' but used more like our terms for 'characteristics' 'attributes' 'properties'. They are not to be seen, as in the Abhidhamma, as having 'ultimate existence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Otherwise not much of a problem here: These four do delineate form. But remember form is an attribute of any 'thing' that has come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact is not a thing, but is the factor on which sensation (vedana) depends. Vedana is the experience of pleasure or pain or neither as a consequence of a sense organ coming into contact with a sense object.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way contact is the factor on which perception, sankaram (Bhk. Thanissaro's translation: fabrications) own-making, and consciousness appear.</p>

					<p class="f4">You can see then rupa gave rise to sense-experience, perception and consciousness; sense experience, perception and consciousness (just ways of speaking about consciousness and at one place noted that it is not possible to have one without the others or to distinguish one from the others, the three are aspects of a process like flame, heat and light) are the reasons the being takes the action called sankhara and that which enable him to take such action (own-making) and so these are the factors on which rupa depends.</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:] Can we take this in parts, as I keep reading it and seeing, but I clearly don't truly understand this point. Nama-rupa and vinanna co-arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] Well this is just about the most difficult thing in the world to see, so we can give you some slack.</p>

					<p class="f4">They arise 'co-dependently'. This happens with regard to 'being' and 'rebirth' in a very swift way that requires great calm and detachment to see, but a sort of example can be made using ordinary experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">You note a sense of hunger and form the idea that you will go out to the local McDonald's to get something to eat. This is the first half of your 'sankaraming'. You have invested identification with intent to create experience and have set going momentum with your intent. Then, going out to the McDonald's, you receive your food or not depending on your kamma, and you experience the second half of the sankharaming: identification with the created experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">So sensations of hunger (nama/rupa) created consciousness of being hungry, and conscious intention to get food created the nama/rupa of the experience of eating at the McDonald's.</p>

					<p class="f4">You can try this (but it is very difficult) (something like the Zen sitting practice): Sit and without even paying attention to the breathing try to escape even the very beginning of any thought, interest, examination anything whatsoever.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within seconds you will find yourself involved in some thought ... or asleep.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doing this will be a very vigorous and active process and should not be taken as anything other than an exercise in the attempt to understand the difficulty of perceiving this consciousness/nama/rupa connection, but will give you some idea: one must be one step ahead of or above the point where the world of conscious experience is being formed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note here the difference between this and the Zen 'Empty the mind' where here the instruction is to not allow disturbance to the mind to enter from outside. The first can never be done no matter what the Zen people say as it is a doing which is an activity occupying the mind in and of itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, imagine you are sitting there watching the world, like a movie unfolding in front of you. A story is evolving. It involves a young guy and the most beautiful lass in the land. She is not too tall, not too short ... . You get interested. Drawn in. You begin identifying with the young guy and start to feel what they call kinesthesia — the physical reaction of a person in the audience to the muscular efforts of a dancer or other sort of performer. Before you realize it you are in the story. Bit by bit you are dragged into the worrisome problem of how 'you' (now as the young guy) were born. And there you are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your job as the Buddhist Seeker is to arrive back at the state where you are (without identifying as 'you') just observing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So at the first perception of the sort of consciousness that is connected to an object, or to the sort of object that is connected to the sort of consciousness that is connected to objects, you back off. [For a detailed discussion of he nature of the consciousness of the Arahant and of the method to be used for the realization of that, see the discussion '<a href="dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna Conditioned?</a>,' and the follow-up discussion of 'Vinnana Anidassana' on that page.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:] And the function of a pure mind is? This is not the mind of any baby, I presume, but some mind that has not been corrupted by eons of societal conditioning? I note the impulse within for the arising of the kinds of questions the Buddha would never answer. Why, where, how, etc.</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] When you say: 'And the function of a pure mind is?' you are again falling into the view of one who identifies with 'states' and continuity of existence. Functions can only be had with continuity. To speak of 'a' Pure Mind, is to speak of it as existing which is what I am warning you to avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">The function of the Buddhist seeker is to cleans the mind of impurities that come from without. That is attained at the point where there is the perception:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">This is the real,<br />
							this is the best, namely,<br />
							the calming of all activities,<br />
							the rejection of every substrate,<br />
							the ending of craving,<br />
							the fading of interest,<br />
							stopping and nibbana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Note that this does not describe the 'creation' of anything, state or whatever. 'Nibbāna' has become commonly identified with a state, but that is a misunderstanding. The term means not-bound up which is not a state but a non-state.</p>

					<p class="f4">If that does not sound like a reasonable goal to you at this point, your better tactic would be to go back a few steps and hike up your practice of generosity, cultivation of ethical thinking, and setting up your perception of the world using the four satipatthanas. That is not me being superior or denegrating you, that is simply what needs to be done in this case.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is said that:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'There are four things that are so and not not-so, and neither are they otherwise. What four?<br />
							This is dukkha.<br />
							The origin of dukkha is hunger.<br />
							The ending of dukkha is the ending of huger.<br />
							The Magga is the way to end the hunger.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">— [misquoted to insert the implication of the original sutta at] SN 56.20</p>

					<p class="f4">These are real things to be seen. This is not some philosophical proposition, but something that one who sees things without fantasy will see just as described.</p>

					<p class="f4">For most people, maybe for all, considering rebirth, the process begins with blindness. Everything is wonderful. One takes up the study of the Dhamma because that is where the girls are. The fame and fortune, the power. Then some of it sinks in and one begins to bring the practice into one's every-day life through loving-kindness, generosity, ethical culture, mental development through sitting. Then one sees the problem that there is not anything in anything anywhere for you, is exactly as described and only then does the notion of letting go and becoming downbound to nothing at all in the world make sense.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:] You have said that the whole of the Dhamma can be worked out from a very small bit. So how important is it to understand rebirth consciousness when one needs just a bit of the dhamma to awaken?</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] When I say that one only needs a bit of the Dhamma to awaken I am speaking about what it takes to work out the details in full, not that the end product is a tiny bit of a thing ... although the end product is a tiny bit of a thing. You could encompass it all under the term: upekkha: detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sariputta worked out the whole system understanding only that 'things that have come to be have have come to be as a result of driving forces'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked if the teaching could be given in one word Gotama once answered 'yes': whatsoever is connected to tanha, thirst, understand that that is not of this Dhamma. He answered the same question another way by saying that if 'appamada' were made a big thing of it would serve.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Dhamma in detail is to my mind a way of keeping one's eye on the ball. It's various ways of approaching the problem, the mental gymnastics, learning magic powers, the psychology etc. are all ways of keeping focused on the issue. The issue itself is the most difficult problem anyone will ever have dealt with and the distractions are innumerable, powerful, and subtle.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of the emphasis on consciousness here is that what we are speaking of as the goal is a thing which must in no case ever be described in any way that implies an existing thing (such as a 'state' or 'state of mind' or 'original consciousness'), as, if you look at the Maha-Nidana sutta, you will see that this is the process for creating an existing thing:</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] That is what I mean. Whatever is known is an object and all objects are rupa, so yes, that is the meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rupa encompasses it all, including Nama;<br />
					Nama encompasses it all, including Rupa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Try thinking of it that way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Try thinking of it in Greek: phe = face; nomenon = name. Anything, any phenomena, is a thing that has 'become' is rupa and has been identified with a name, had a face put on it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Any thing that has become is 'confounded'. Sankharam. But the clear translation is 'Own-Made' San(g) is con, with, one-with, once, and own. Khara is made, founded, manufactured. But what we are dealing with is the fact of personal identification, so using own-made keeps the real issue in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sankhara is like kamma except it is personal. It has two sides. It is the identification with the intent to create experience through acts of body, speech and mind, and it is the identified-with object that is created. Sankharing and the sankharamed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds and thoughts have form whether or not the form can be perceived with the eye. Sound waves. Thought waves. It is the nature of absolutely anything that has come to be that it is own-made and that which is own-made begins with the contact of name-form and consciousness. So sounds and thoughts being things that have become have the attribute of being rupa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where a lot of the confusion enters, is in the idea of the non-rupa jhanas (arupa). This is just a bad use of terminology. What it signifies is not forms of existence that have no rupa, but which have no identification with the form aspect of the thing or state. Pure thought. But as above, thought is rupa. And even this is wrong in terms of the actuality in many of the states called arupa. The Brahma realms are inhabited by beings with light as form; so also the abhassara and subhakinna realms.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Thus the Buddha advocated viewing a "being" simply as a process of attachment to desire, passion, delight, and craving. And it is precisely this attachment to craving that allows for rebirth after death:"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">-Bhk. Thanissaro</p>

					<p class="f4">This makes sense to me. That the being is simply the process. But the process is unstable and dukkha. Because of that it isn't a self.</p>

					<p class="f4">I've never really understood what it is that is reborn though, and how that impacts any of the practical aspects of the path. Didn't the Buddha say somewhere "act as if there's a god, and if there is or isn't you'll be ok?" I've approached rebirth consciousness in this way. Heck I'm just trying to wrap my head around D.O. (which of course is the process by which birth happens). Sigh. OK so the rebirth consciousness is constructed. So it arises and passes. Presumably either based on the conditions arising from death or the moments before death based on the conditions that lead up to death? It then falls away, or lays dormant, with birth until the appropriate conditions manifest for its arising or the kamma is extinguished?</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] Gotama speaks of using a two-sided approach with regard to some ideas when one is in doubt. Covering one's bets. The ideas are usually the same: belief in kamma and the good and bad outcome that results from good and bad deeds, belief in the existence of God, gods, and evil ones, belief in the existence of mothers and fathers, and the existence of beings who have known and seen these things for themselves through actual experience. The logic is that acting in accordance with the idea that these things are true one is respected by wise men here, and if they are true one receives the benefit of having acted in accordance, if one acts in accordance with the idea that these things are true and they are not true, one still has the respect of wise men here and there is no loss. If one acts as though these things were not true wise men here think one foolish and if they are true one has lost the benefit and depending on how one acted in a world where one believed there was no punishment from bad deeds or rebirth in bad states, could end up in deep shit.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When you say: "...what it is that is reborn..." you are describing the view that there is a continuation of self, Sati's position, and what is being denied by Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will try to convey the idea with familiar similes:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like one match lighting another. The match does not travel from one match to the other, neither does the flame nor the heat, nor the light.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like offset printing. The image does not travel from the positive original to the negative negative to the positive plate to the negative offset to the positive printed page and neither does the original paper nor thoughts, etc.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like sitting in a movie theater watching a movie and becoming absorbed in the story. When the reality is examined what is seen is a series of individual frames, still shots, being imagined to run together to form a continuity.</p>

					<p class="f4">One person might say it was like the difference between a movie created by a film camera versus a movie created by a digital camera. The images in the film version clearly show the discrete elements, the movie in the digital version runs together without breaking up the story into frames. But then a person with deeper vision would point to the pixels in the digital image. And so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nama/rupa and consciousness arise in infinitely small discrete bits, form larger more consciously identified sense impressions which are joined together in the mind to make pictures which appear to have the continuity of a story.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no 'process' there although what is happening is a process, no thing that can leap from one part of it to another.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:] This is all great stuff, thank you. But a bit more on nama/rupa itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is said that: "Nama is feeling, perception, volition, contact, attention" — MN 9</p>

					<p class="f4">Ok so what is attention? I'm not sure I've seen this in another context.</p>

					<p class="f4">You say above that nama is much like our understanding of perception, and MN 109 brings in the khandas. So how do the khandas relate to nama/rupa?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is further said that: "Nama-rupa is the cause and condition for the manifestation of the consciousness aggregate."</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet this consciousness aggregate isn't the consciousness found in the Paticca Samuppada? One is prcoess and one is an "object(?)" taken as a thing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Same question for rupa. Rupa in the Paticca Samuppada is the process by which form comes about, but in the aggragagetes it's the four material elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">How are we to understand this?</p>

					<p class="f4">How does one use nama/rupa in practice? What practices exist for harnessing it as a tool for awakening?</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:]  As to your first question here, 'what is attention'? the word being translated is 'manasikaro', 'mind-cultivation', 'study', not 'attention'. = 'yonisomanasikaro': 'studious etiological examination'. 'Examination'.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is going on in this sutta is that Sariputta is demonstrating the holographic nature of the Dhamma. Each of the sequences represents an ENTIRE path to Nibbāna. This is a form of mental gymnastics found throughout the Dhamma as Teaching. It serves the learner who is forced to see how each of these segments is really just another way of stating the others.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask: '...how do the khandhas relate to nama/rupa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Nama/Rupa is a way of describing absolutely everything 'in the world'.</p>

					<p class="f4">So is the group called the khandhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is another example of the way the Dhamma is so constructed that each basic teaching category is really a complete path to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">One function of this phenomenon is that a teacher can approach instructing a student from a virtually infinite number of angles and with a great flexibility as to appropriateness of detail and the length of the instruction and always be sure that the student has been left with a complete path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nama/rupa is the condition upon which the arising of consciousness depends. That is 'paticca samuppada' 'rebounding conjuration'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some expositions of paticca samuppada do not explicitly state the double re-appearance of vinnana:</p>

					<p class="f4">Blindness rebounds bound up in own-making.
					Own-making rebounds bound up in consciousness (vinnana).
					Consciousness rebounds bound up in nama/rupa
					nama/rupa rebounds bound up in consciousness (of the six sense realms).</p>

					<p class="f4">In both cases the consciousness spoken of is own-consciousness, identified-with consciousness, consciousness that has become a thing, not the consciousness of the Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of Bhk. Thanissaro saying that the Buddha is speaking about process is not to make a distinction between process and the so-called reality. The Buddha, in fact, does not speak about process. Bhk. Thanissaro is trying to point out how the illusion of self is mistaking what is a process for a continuity, he is not trying to say that there is a process there that is separate from the phenomena. That is, that has an identity of it's own.</p>

					<p class="f4">To state that the four great elements, dhatu, (actually better to translate dhatu as aspects, attributes or characteristics) are rupa is not to limit the scope of rupa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Re-examine MN 1, The Mulapariyaya. The idea of identifying the four elements is to get at and get rid of the tendancy to identify with them, not to define them as existing things. Think of them as attributes of a conscious being, and it is also helpful to understand that the terms should be taken figuratively as well as literally: solidity, liquidity, having heat and light, and motion.</p>

					<p class="f4">I think the above paragraph also answers your last question as to how to use the concepts to cultivate your mind. Identify these attributes and the examine yourself as to the notion of self per the method of the mulapariyaya: 'I am not earth' 'Earth is not mine.' 'I am not "of Earth"' 'Earth is not [an aspect] "of me".</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] Round and round. Just eliminate the doubt here and you have it at least basically.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Paticca Samuppada describes the process by which blindness leads back to rebirth. You can think of it as a detailed description of how kamma works. Or a detailed description of how sankhara works. Or a detailed description of how the Four Aristocrats of Truths work.</p>

					<p class="f4">The five aggregates (khandhas = shitpiles) describe that which we imagine to be a self. Further it is said that there is no 'being' outside of the khandhas. A similar statement is made with regard to The All (the eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and scents, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, the mind and ideas). A similar thing is said by Mara, Baka Brahma and Pajapati Brahma and acknowledged by the Buddha: "Mine is Earth, Water, Firelight, and Wind!" meaning that these four also encompass it all when understood in their broadest and deepest interpretations, and so are owned by Mara, and if one is identified with such, one belongs to Mara (or Pajapati, the Creator of the Created).</p>

					<p class="f4">And while name and form is the condition for the consciousness khandha, each khandha is also rupa. Any 'thing' which has come to be has come to be with these three properties: consciousness+form+name.</p>

					<p class="f4">[GS:] Bishop George Berkely wrote: "What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind." His theory, summed up in his dictum, "Esse est percipi" ("To be is to be perceived"), states that individuals can only directly know sensations and ideas of objects, not abstractions such as "matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Most Western philosophers tend to fall in love with their ideas and take them too far, but it strikes me that there's a kernel of what we're discussing in here.</p>

					<p class="f4">"all the things surrounding us are nothing but our ideas." "Sensed things have no other existence distinct from their being perceived by us."</p>

					<p class="f4">[OBO:] This introduces the notion that I associate with Hume and Heisenberg that I have termed 'Pajapati's Problem'. That is, that a being identified with his senses has no way of perceiving the world directly. — Your Bishop above arrogantly reverses the position, assuming an 'himself' that is the real world. — His perception of the world is always as interpreted by his individualized consciousness's understanding of his sense impressions. Since the sense impression marks the entry into his world of 'things' there is a wired-in perception that 'he' is (one is, one's self) the creator. The two happen simultaneously. It looks like one thinks things into being.</p>

					<p class="f4">This phenomena arises as a consequence of the gradual arising of consciousness of a thing. A thing does not appear made from one single instance of a consciousness connected nama/rupa so one can have some foreknowledge. If one is blind to the foreknowledge one can think that one has 'thought it up' thinking the early vague buildup is his 'thinking it up'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Recollect the instruction found in the Satipattana and in numerous places elsewhere: 'Thus he lives in the body, sense experience, mental states, or ideas watching over the origins of things'. [see also in full detail below]</p>

					<p class="f4">I consider this to be the real problem solved by the Buddha. It is because of the implications of the idea we have that we are the creator that we continue to accept rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without the notion that there is no thing there that is the self, assuming we exist, at death we simultaneously face the issue of existence where we are the only real person there or the responsibility of having created all the suffering in the world simply for our own entertainment and solice in our lonliness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Get rid of the idea that there is in fact something there that IS the self and the problems of being God disappear.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a whole series of suttas that deal with the proposition: It is because of the variety of things, that there is a variety of perceptions, and not the reverse. If this problem were not the problem being dealt with there would be no need for pointing this out because that is what people think they think. But it is not the way they act and it is the way they act that is the real way they perceive and think.</p>

					<h4>Consciousness</h4>

					<p class="f4">And how is the food that is consciousness to be considered?</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine a criminal who is brought before the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">The guards say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your Highness, this is a robber,<br />
					a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					a no-good,<br />
					good for nuth'n,<br />
					murder'n sum-gum<br />
					fo shu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let your Highness inflict upon him<br />
					such punishment as he deserves."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the king says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Take this man<br />
					and bind him hand and foot<br />
					and place him in a cart<br />
					and parade him around town<br />
					and then take him out the south gate<br />
					and there cut him a hundred times.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the guards do just that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at noon the King asks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is that man?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the guards respond:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At this time he is still living, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, cut this man another hundred times."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the guards do that,<br />
					and again at dusk the King asks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is that man?"</p>

					<p class="f4">and the guards respond:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At this time he is still living, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the king commands<br />
					that the guards cut him<br />
					with another hundred cuts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man,<br />
					thus cut 300 times<br />
					experience death<br />
					or excruciating deadly pains<br />
					as a consequence?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how the food that is consciousness is to be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness is considered in this way,<br />
					named form is understood<br />
					and when named form is understood<br />
					there is nothing more that needs to be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is how it works:</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is lust, beggars, for [any of the four foods — the sutta, linked below, treats each food separately],<br />
					where there is delight,<br />
					where there is hunger and thirst,<br />
					this results in a stand for the growth of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is a stand for the growth of consciousness,<br />
					then there is the appearance of name and form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is the appearance of name and form,<br />
					then there is the sowing of own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is the sowing of own-making,<br />
					then there is scope for the again-becoming of further-return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is scope for the again-becoming of further-return,<br />
					then there is scope for birth, aging and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is scope for birth, aging and death,
					it is with grief beggars, with fear, it is not without trouble, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the reverse:</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is no lust, beggars, for [any of the four foods],<br />
					where there is no delight,<br />
					where there is no hunger and thirst,<br />
					no stand for the growth of consciousness results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is no stand for the growth of consciousness,<br />
					then there is no appearance of name and form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is no appearance of name and form,
					then there is no sowing of own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is no sowing of own-making,
					then there is no scope for the again-becoming of further-return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is no scope for the again-becoming of further-return,<br />
					then there is no scope for birth, aging and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is no scope for birth, aging and death,
					that is without grief beggars, without fear, it is without trouble, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what can we do to escape envelopment in experience<br />
					through the six senses?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then this thought occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is there right here in front of our eyes<br />
					that leads to envelopment in experience<br />
					through the six senses?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tracking the etiology of this, Beggars,<br />
					I could see:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where we have the interoperation of names and forms,<br />
					there also we have envelopment in experience<br />
					through the six senses.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The interoperation of names and forms<br />
					exists here in front of our eyes<br />
					and we can see for ourselves<br />
					that the interoperation of names and forms is necessary<br />
					for the existence of envelopment in experience<br />
					through the six senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without the interoperation of names and forms<br />
					we would have no envelopment in experience<br />
					through the six senses."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what can we do to escape<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then this thought occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is there right here in front of our eyes<br />
					that leads to the interoperation of names and forms?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tracking the etiology of this, Beggars,<br />
					I could see:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where we have individualized consciousness,<br />
					there also we have the interoperation of names and forms.'</p>

					<p class="f4">individualized consciousness exists here in front of our eyes<br />
					and we can see for ourselves<br />
					that individualized consciousness is necessary<br />
					for the existence of the interoperation of names and forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without individualized consciousness,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But what can we do to escape individualized consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">This individualized consciousness,<br />
					is delimited by the interoperation of names and forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">To have consciousness as an individual<br />
					it is necessary to have the interoperation of names and forms<br />
					and it is not necessary to have anything more<br />
					than the interoperation of names and forms<br />
					to have consciousness as an individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is only to this point<br />
					that there is that which is understood to be "a being,"<br />
					"a being born"<br />
					aging, sickness and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">What I saw, Beggars,<br />
					was that to have consciousness as an individual<br />
					it is necessary to have the interoperation of names and forms;</p>

					<p class="f4">To have interoperation of names and forms<br />
					it is necesssary to have consciousness as an individual;</p>

					<p class="f4">To have envelopment in experience through the six senses<br />
					it is necessary to have interoperation of names and forms;</p>

					<p class="f4">To have contact between consciousness,<br />
					sense organ and sense object<br />
					it is necessary to have envelopment in experience through the six senses;</p>

					<p class="f4">To have sensations of pleasure and pain and of neither pleasure nor pain it is necessary to have contact between consciousness, sense organ and sense object;</p>
