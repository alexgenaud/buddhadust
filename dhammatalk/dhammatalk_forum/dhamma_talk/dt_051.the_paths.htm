					<h1>The Paths</h1>
					
					<p class="f4">In [<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p126">AN 4.126</a>] The Buddha describes four paths to the Pure Abodes based on the four devine lifestyles: friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment in combination with seeing that form, sense-experience, sense-perception, own-making, and sense-consciousness are changable, painful, a sickness, a boil, a dart, grief-ridden, an opression, another's, destined for destruction, empty, and not-self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are the Paths described in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p125">AN 4.125</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p126">AN 4.126</a> together with those of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p123">AN 4.123</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p124">AN 4.124</a>:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> One complete evolution and devolution of the World-system.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> There is no specification as to the nature of the 'hearer' (<i>Bhagavato sāvaka</i>), but presumably this would at least require the individual to have unshakable faith or to have conceived the yearning to bring rebirth to an end or the idea of Arahantship would not occur to him ... and it would not happen unawares.</p>

					</div>

					<p class="f4">Except for the cases of the non-believer, all of these are Non-Returner paths. Note that except where the practice of <i>jhāna</i> leads directly to the Pure Abodes, the implication is that the full lifespan of the destination is to be lived Ḷ. There is a definate progression with regard to rebirth of each succeeding devine abiding, with that of <i>upekha,</i> rebirth in the Vehapphala-world being the most pleasant and long lasting, but that if the time it takes to achieve Arahantship is considered, the heierarchy is reversed. This accords with a theme that runs throughout the suttas that it is better to 'take one's medicine' here — that though the life in lower worlds may be more unpleasant, it is also more conducive to achieving the goal. A note of caution not to take this to extremes! The situation again reverses at the point below human birth where each succeeding lower rebirth is more difficult to escape.</p>
