						<p class="f4"><i>Sati.</i> Most translations conflate 'Sati' with 'Satipaṭṭhāna'. It is "Mind" and "Setting up the Mind". 'Satipaṭṭhāna' deals with the practices necessary to build up, organize and maintain the memory. Sati is the end-product, a mind above it all, seeing how body, experiences, mental states and The Dhamma come to be and burn out, watchful and careful, recollected, reviewing and calming down, overcoming any thirsts, ambitions and disappointments that may appear, able to recall in minute detail things said and done long ago.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Ekāyano ayaɱ Maggo.</i> The recommended solution, 'One Sure Way' is a reasonable read of the Pali, but mostly serves to eliminate the idea of 'one and only one way' which today offends some sensibilities. 'The One and Only Way' is problematic only to outsiders; those with insight into the holographic nature of the Dhamma will see that 'This One Way' encompasses the many other ways described in the Dhamma, and those other ways encompass this way.</p>

						<p class="f4">But what in Bhk. Sujato's translation, does 'convergence' mean here? Convergence with what? Convergence into Nibbāna? That would be a gloss and a bad one at that in that it requires foreknowledge of Dhamma and the Goal by the reader. As it is it doesn't make sense.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Kāya. (Vedana, Citta, Dhamma) Kāyānupassi.</i> Bhk. Bodhi's 'body as a body' is not helpful as an instruction as to how to organize one's memories over the entire category 'body'. The idea is to so observe that mode in which you live so as to have all that occurs in it organized; easily retrievable. That includes such things as seeing that the thing comes to be, is transient, brings pain, etc., as well as being just the thing it is. Bhk. Thanissaro's 'focusing on the body, etc., in and of itself' just passes, but misses the idea of these four things being modes of living. It could be 'observing an aspect' per Bhk. Sujato. It is also 'observing the whole', and observing how things that are not the body proper affect the body, etc., or point to the destiny of bodies, etc.. But the Pali does not point to either an aspect or the whole. The way it is phrased it covers all angles. All ignore the <i>'viharati'</i> where the idea is 'living in a body, one oversees (synonym for sati; minds) the body'. "Living in" means that this is the primary focus of one's daily habits. One lives primarily concerned with the body and its activities; another primarily with experiences; another primarily with one's mental states; another lives with everything referenced to the Dhamma.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Vedanā.</i> This word serves three functions in the Dhamma: Experience, Sense-experience and sensation. Experience when it is experience in general and when it is the extra-sensory experience of the Arahant; sense-experience when it is experience of an existing being; sensation when it is what is felt upon experience. Feeling covers only one of these uses.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Citta.</i> Translated 'mind' it removes vital information as to the nature of this mind. The broad idea is heart; not in the sense of the physical organ, but in the sense of 'at the heart of the matter' the central focus. And in other uses it conveys the idea of having the will to act.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Dhamma.</i> There are two forms in which this word appears: with capital "D" and with lower case "d". In the Pāḷi there is no such distinction. Determination of which is which must be made from context and sometimes that can be confusing. The former distinguishes the teachings of the Buddha and is a synonym of "Pāḷi". The latter means 'thing'. 'Principles' describes rules for behavior or judgment derived from some source. The Dhamma, specifically The Four Truths, is the source, not the principle. One could make aspects of the Dhamma into one's principles, one cannot turn the whole of the Dhamma into a set of principles. </p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Chanda.</i> This term must indicate some sort of will to act; Bhk Sujato's 'enthusiasm' in-and-of-itself has no component related to intent to act. Someone with enthusiasm could well have an intent to act, but that is a separate thing.</p>

						<p class="f4">The paths spelled out. So far I have not seen a translation of the paths that makes sense or really satisfies. Bhk. Sujato's construction makes sense, but where in it is <i>'sankhāra'</i> (his 'choices'? Oh! Here it is: 'active' [effort: padhāna]. So is 'Sankhāra' for him 'choices' or 'active'? And if both, how? Where is the equivalence?</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Sambojjhangā.</i> Where is the 'sam' in the translations? These are the things that one needs in order to awaken one's self.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Dhamma-Vicaya.</i> How can one effectively investigate one's 'principles' (Bhk. Sujato) if one has not investigated the basis for forming principles? The term would most usefully indicate the fact that it is at this point that one investigates 'things' and 'the Dhamma'.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Pīti.</i> I believe it was Bhk. Thanissaro and his personal experience of what his teacher called 'rapture' (which sounds like it was in fact rapture of a sort) that has imposed that term on us for the translation of <i>Pīti.</i> But <i>Pīti</i> is in fact a term that covers an emotional liking that spans appreciation, mild liking, enthusiasm, excitement, friendly feelings, affection, love and higher order emotions such as rapture. A word is needed that encompasses the lot. </p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Samādhi.</i> <i>Samādhi</i> is not 'concentration'. Concentration is way too narrow a concept to cover the scope of <i>'samādhi'. Samādhi has</i> concentration, <i>uses</i> concentration, but is itself a state with flexible attention and is certainly open to interference by insights. As 'immersion' (Bhk. Sujato) this is precisely what <i>'samādhi'</i> is not. The word either means 'over and above' or 'even higher'. <i>Samādhi</i> is a state of full alertness while being in full control. And if the term is to align with the goals of the Dhamma, it needs to indicate not 'immersion in', but 'detachment from'. And this does not deal with the various other descriptions of <i>Samādhi</i> as encompassing the whole of the practice; as being also the states of signlessness, aimlessness and pointlessness, and consisting of three other sorts (see PED): with thinking and pondering; with pondering only; without thnking or pondering.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Upekkha.</i> Everyone loves equanimity. But 'equanimity' is a state of balance between two conditions. <i>Upekkha</i> is used two ways in the suttas: as a state balanced between two conditions; and as the state of being detached from all conditions. Not between any two things. Technically it is the difference between being freed from things of Time (the world, existence); and being freed from things not of Time (recognizing in the freedom from things of Time that this recognition is one step removed from freedom from things of Time and is an ultimate freedom which because it is not based on anything own-made (things of Time) it is not subject to change or pain.</p>

						<p class="f4"><i>Passaddhi, Samādhi, Upekkha.</i> These three need to form a progression. First you calm down and stop reacting: impassivity; then you become serene/above it all; then you detach.</p>

						<p class="f4">The Satta Sambojjhangā is a complete path to <i>Nibbāna.</i> Ask yourself if a path that ends in equanimity is one that does that. Disturbance is implicit in equanimity.</p>

							<p class="f4">Eight/Ten. The 'Ten' is generally more satisfying in that it can be set up: <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> as working hypothesis &gt; <i>Sammā Diṭṭhā</i> actual experience of seeing. The Eight still works but you need to work out how the story ends either through experience of Fourth <i>Jhāna</i> or from other suttas.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Sammā</i> and <i>Micchā</i> The idea of 'Sammā' is not that a 'sammā thing' is the right thing and all other things are wrong. The idea is that these things are the best choice among other choices which may be best for other purposes. Consummate, best, or highest. The opposite condition is not 'wrong'. It means 'contrary' or 'misguided', or 'opposing'. Why should such an established set of terms be altered? Because hanging on to things being 'right' or 'wrong' is taking sides and holding points of view and that is involvement with the world and the fact that the individual is blind to that fact precludes their escape from such views.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Diṭṭhi.</i> 'View' works if one remembers that 'views' are opinions and opinions are not necessarily true and that what is required to put this step of the path into action is to use Sammā Diṭṭhi as a working hypothesis; to be proved by trial and error following the rest of the path. Using the ten-fold path one is almost compelled to use 'working hypothesis' to avoid an incomprehensible redundancy.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Saɱkappa.</i> This is 'principles'. First one sets up one's working hypothesis, then one determines the principles that follow from that working hypothesis. If it is all pain, what is one's first principle? Dumping it.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Kammanta.</i> To say this term stands for 'action' is to ignore the common context of 'commerse' and to force it into being an exact synonym of kamma which it is not. The word is really a manta, a composite term that means: Work, mantras, commerse. 'Works' covers all this.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Ājīva.</i> The word means 'to live'. What one does to live. So 'livelihood' and 'living' would work if the term did not so completely ignore the idea of making a living or earning one's keep. Sammā ājīva is the practice of analyzing one's situation and determining those aspects of it that are causing good states to vanish or diminish and bad states to appear or increase and getting rid of them. It is a style or manner of living to be applied to every aspect of one's life, not just a way of earning a living.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Vāyāma.</i> A synonym for <i>'padhānā'.</i> The effort being made is to establish self-control.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Avijjā.</i> Not-vision. Not 'ignorance'. Not seeing. The simile is of two men standing at the foot of a mountain. One climbs to the top and describes the 360° angle of view; the other denies that such a view is possible. The first comes down and brings the second up to the top where he sees what he could not see before. At the foot of the mountain #2 could know in theory about (have knowledge of) what can be seen from a height but could not see it. The term needs to indicate a lack of actual experience of seeing: blindness.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Ñāṇa.</i> Knowlege. Book knowledge. The Streamwinner has '<i>Ñāṇa and Dassana</i>': knowing and seeing (of the fact that whatsoever has come to be will allso pass away). The Arahant has first <i>Vijjā</i> (he sees the Four Truths as they are) then <i>Upekkhā</i> (Detachment) ... but it is also said of the Arahant (Arahants are also Streamwinners) that he has knowledge and vision.</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Vimutti.</i> Freedom is correct. Release is 'Vimokkha'. Release implies a possibly temporary state, freedom points to the absolute state. We want the absolute state and the progression in the suttas is from Vimokkha to vimutti.</p>

						<p class="f4">The position here relative to the whole of the <i>Pāḷi,</i> but most particularly to the <i>jhānas</i> is that there is no-one living today that it is reasonable to trust as to personal claims at experience of such that would inform anything other than a translation that held tightly to the etymological, literal and contextual Pāḷi (<b>all three!</b>). This makes Bhk. Sujato odd man out when it comes to his translation of the formulas for the <i>jhānas</i> (and some other terms).</p>

						<p class="f4">The way he has constructed the <i>jhānas</i> one begins by sitting down and focusing mindfulness right there (<i>parimukhaɱ satim</i>) (without saying what 'right there' means), and, without instruction as to abandoning thinking and pondering (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> outside <i>jhāna</i> where he accepts this meaning in so many words) one abandons thinking and pondering (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>) classing it as 'unskillful' (though there are clearly skillful thoughts or how would one ever think to study the <i>Dhamma</i>?); then in addition to focusing mindfulness right there (<i>parimukhaɱ satim</i>), one places the mind and keeps it connected (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> inside <i>jhāna</i> — though there is no distinction made anywhere in the suttas as to an inside and outside <i>jhāna vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>) (connected to what is not specified) and somehow by solitude alone, rapture (the highest defined meaning of <i>pīti</i>) and bliss arise.</p>

						<p class="f4">That is quite an accomplishment for the first stage of a progression of steps leading away from involvement with such things of the world as sensuality and unskillful things.</p>

						<p class="f4">The position here is that the first <i>jhāna</i> is the first step up off active involvement with the world. You are still thinking as you were before <i>jhāna,</i> but now the thoughts and pondering are constructive towards achieving the goal: thinkinig and pondering over problems interfering with living the Dhamma and understanding the Dhamma, ending in the transition from the first to the second <i>jhāna</i> when one has reached the point where thinking and pondering are not needed, at least for the time being. Thus the first <i>jhāna</i> is relatively easy to get to in it's simplest form, but it evolves in depth as one's practice evolves. What is necessary for the first <i>jhāna</i> is solitude and an appreciation of that solitude. This way there is nothing hidden from view: the factors of the <i>jhānas</i> are stated and then removed a bit at a time as indicated in the formulas. Going beyond what is there is hubris.</p>

						<p class="f4">Then, for the second <i>jhāna,</i> after all our work of sitting down and focusing mindfulness right there (<i>parimukhaɱ satim</i>), without instruction as to how it happens, placing the mind and keeping it connected (<i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i> inside <i>jhāna</i>) are stilled.</p>

						<p class="f4">Where is this headed? I have a theory. This view of the <i>jhānas</i> is one which cannot be practiced. Trying to do it per Bhk. Sujato's formula results in getting twisted up like a pretzel. Looking to the outcome as the intent we recollect the early statements of commentators that the <i>jhānas</i> are no longer possible to attain. This is great cover for one who has no ability to achieve <i>jhāna</i> as described in the suttas using plain speaking Pali. This in turn strengthens reliance on the commentaries which strengthens the rapidly self-destructing pre-eminance of the Theravada tradition. How Bhk. Sujato, who at one time spoke of his 'almost being ashamed of being a Theravadan Bhikkhu' and who also has published works criticizing the commentaries ended up on the side of the commentators with this position is a mystery. Or not. The position serves well as a cover for those who can't whether ancient or modern.</p>

						<p class="f4">Bhk. Sujato's formulas for <i>jhānas</i> three and four are more or less standard.</p>

						<p class="f4">Here is the thing: However translated the formulas for the <i>jhānas</i> must go from involvement to less involvement with the world. The Four are a progression ending in utter detachment. Generally, following the recommended formulas or those of the others except Bhk. Sujato's one does go from involvement to detachment. Using Bhk. Sujato's formula you go spinning around and around never getting even to the first <i>jhāna.</i></p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Sankhārā.</i> For a thorough discussion of this term and how it is being mis-translated all around see the discussion: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna Conditioned?</a> Bhk. Sujato's 'choices' is a matter of taking one factor of a process and calling it the whole process. What we are doing here is making trouble for ourselves by continuously re-creating existence in a personal world. That is own-making and 'own-making' serves well for the phenomena described wherever <i>sankhāra</i> is found. To chose among alternative plans, schemes, intentions, actions in order to to get experience of living is the meaning of <i>'upadana'.</i></p>
