					<p class="f4">"Nay, verily, Reverend Sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Accordingly, Ānanda, it is not possible to hold the view, 'Verily, neither is sensation my Ego, nor does my Ego have no sensation. My Ego has sensation; my Ego possesses the faculty of sensation.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p32" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.15.pali.bd.htm#p32">32</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.15.rhyt.pts.htm#p32">pts</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/dn/dn.15.wlsh.wp.htm#p32">bodh</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.15.than.ati.htm#p32">than</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.15.olds.bd.htm#p32">olds</a>]</span> "From the time, Ānanda, a priest no longer holds the view that sensation is the Ego, no longer holds the view that the Ego has no sensation, no longer holds the view that the Ego has sensation, possesses the faculty of sensation, he ceases to attach himself to anything in the world, and being free from attachment, he is never agitated, and being never agitated, he attains to Nirvana in his own person; and he knows that rebirth is exhausted, that he has lived the holy life, that he has done what it behooved him to do, and that he is no more for this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now it is impossible, Ānanda, that to a mind so freed a priest should attribute the heresy that the saint exists after death, or that the saint does not exist after death, or that the saint both exists and does not exist after death, or that the saint neither exists nor does not exist after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And why do I say so?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, Ānanda, after a priest has been freed by a thorough comprehension of affirmation and affirmation's range, of predication and predication's range, of declaration and declaration's range, of knowledge and knowledge's field of action, of rebirth and what rebirth affects, it is impossible for him to attribute such a heretical lack of knowledge and perception to a priest similarly freed."</p>

For these three groups have sensation through union with sensation, and possess a faculty of sensation on account of the inseparability of this union.</p>
