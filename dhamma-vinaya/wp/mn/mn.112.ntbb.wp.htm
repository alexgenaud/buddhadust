On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu makes a declaration of final knowledge thus:</p>

					Birth is destroyed,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Friend, there are four kinds of expression rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed,<br />
					who has lived the holy life,<br />
					done what had to be done,<br />
					laid down the burden,<br />
					reached the true goal,<br />
					destroyed the fetters of being,<br />
					and is completely liberated through final knowledge,<br />

					<p class="f4">12. "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed ... and is completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of his answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Friends, formerly when I lived the home life I was ignorant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Tathāgata or his disciple taught me the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing the Dhamma I acquired faith in the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing that faith, I considered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Household life is crowded and dusty;<br />
					life gone forth is wide open.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.</p>

					and go forth from the home life into homelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">On a later occasion,<br />

					abandoning a small or a large circle of relations,<br />
					I shaved off my hair and beard,<br />

					<p class="f4">13-17. "'Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and way of life ... <i>(as Sutta 51, §§14-19)</i> ... I puriified my mind from doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. "'Having thus abandoned these five hindrances,<br />
					imperfecctions of the mind that weaken wisdom,<br />
					quite secluded from aensual pleasures,<br />
					secluded from unwholesome states,<br />
					I entered upon and abided in the first jhana,<br />

					<p class="f4">With the stilling of applied and sustained thought,<br />

					With the abandoning of pleasure and pain ...<br />
					I entered upon and abided in the fourth jhana,<br />

					unblemished,<br />

					<p class="f4">When it was liberated there came the knowlledge:<br />

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> [1056] See n.17. [Which reads: In these four sections the phenomena comprising personality are considered as objects of perception classified into the four categories of the seen, heard, sensed, and cognized. Here, sensed <i>(muta)</i> signifies the data of smell, taste, and touch, cognized <i>(viññāta)</i> the data of introspection, abstract thought, and imagination. The objects of perception are "conceived" when they are cognized in terms of "mine," "I," and "self," or in ways that generate craving, conceit, and views.] </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> [1057] As at MN 111.4, but here these terms are intended to express the complete eradication of defilements by the path of arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> [1058] MA: All these terms signify craving and views.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> [1059] MA: The first phrase negates the consideratioin of the earth element as self, the second negates the consideration of the material and mental factors other than the earth element as self. The same method applies to the other elements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> [1060] The text appears redundant in mentioning both forms <i>(rūpā)</i> and things cognizable (by the mind) through eye-consciousness <i>(cakkhuviññāṇa-viññātabbā)</i>. MA mentions two opinions proposed to resolve this problem. One holds that "forms" refers to visible things that actually enter into cognition, "things cognizable..." to visible things that cease without being cognized. The second holds that the former term signifies all forms without distinction, the latter term the three mental aggregates that function in association with eye-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> [1061] MA explains "I-making" <i>(ahankāra)</i> as conceit and "mine-making <i>(mamankāra)</i> as craving. "All external signs" <i>(nimitta)</i> are external objects.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> [1062] MA: The recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (usually included in this type of exposition) are here omitted because the original question at §11 concerned the attainment of arahantship, not mundane attainments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> [1063] MA says that this sutta is also called the <i>Ekavissajjita Sutta</i> <i>(The Single Answer Discourse)</i>. MA finds it difficult to accont for the "sixfold" mentioned in the original title, since only five questions and answers have come down in the discourse. It suggests dividing the last item into two — one's own body with its consciousness and the conscious bodies of others — and also mentions another opinion that the four nutriments should be brought in as the sixth. Neither of these suggestions, however, appears cogent, and it seems likely that a section has been lost.</p>
