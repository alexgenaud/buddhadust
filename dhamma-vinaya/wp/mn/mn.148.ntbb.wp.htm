					<h4>Bhikkhu Vimalaramsi's Note</h4>

					<p>This Sutta is key to helping the student to release Ego identification. It helps us to realize the truth about how the process of our existence actually works. WE are not what we think we are ! It is very clear in this description of what is actually happening. It is meant to be read out-loud. Do not read it fast. Read it deliberately and consider each section of it as you go along. Reading it out-loud as a group is very helpful.)<br />
					this version has removed all ditto marks so it may be read out-loud in its entirety to realize the end of craving through the six sense doors and to discover the true impersonal nature of the process!</p>
