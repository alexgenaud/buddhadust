					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Su~n~nataavihaara.</i> The discourse will gradually make it clear that this refers to the fruition attainment of voidness (su~n~nataphala-samaapatti), the fruition attainment of arahantship that is entered by focusing upon the void aspect of Nibbaana. See n. 458</p>

					<p class="lgqt">N. 458: All the four deliverances of mind are one in meaning in that they all refer to the fruition attainment of arahantship. MA also points out that the four deliverances are one in meaning because the terms - the immeasurable, nothingness, voidness, and the signless — are all names for Nibbana, which is the object of the fruition attainment of arahantship.<sup>[ <a href="mn.122.ntbb.wp.htm#n7">back to "Greater" footnote 7</a> ]</sup></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> MA: He attends to the perception of forest dependent on the single forest itself, thinking: "This is a forest, this is a tree, this is a mountain, this a grove."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> MA and M.T explain the sense of this passage thus: The disturbance of defilements — attraction and repulsion — that arise through perception of people are not present here. But there is still the disturbance caused by the occurrence of gross states due to lack of the necessary tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> MA: He abandons the perception of forest and attends to the perception of earth because one cannot achieve any distinction in meditation through the perception of forest, neither access concentration nor full absorption. But earth can be used as the preliminary object for kasina, on the basis of which one produces jhana, develops insight and attains arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Having used the perception of earth to attain the four jhanas, he extends the earth-kasina and then removes the kasina sign to attain the base of infinite space. See Vsm X, 6-7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Animitta cetosamaadhi</i> MA: this is the concentration of the mind in insight; it is called "signless" because it is devoid of the signs of permanence, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> See MN 52.4 MA calls this "counter-insight" <i>(pa.tivipassanaa),</i> i.e., the application of the principles of insight to the act of consciousness that exercises the function of insight. On the basis of this he atttains arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Here the words "supreme and unsurpassed" <i>paramaanuttaraa)</i> have been added. MA says that this is the arahant's fruition attainment of voidness.</p>
