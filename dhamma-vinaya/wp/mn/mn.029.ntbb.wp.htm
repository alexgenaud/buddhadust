On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha on the mountain Vulture Peak; it was soon after Devadatta had left.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn346" href="#n346">346</a>]</sup></span> There, referring to Devadatta, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering: 'I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known.' When he has gone forth thus, he acquires gain, honour, and renown. He is pleased with that gain, honour, and renown, and his intention is fulfilled. On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: 'I have gain, honour, and renown, but these other bhikkhus are unknown, of no account.' He becomes intoxicated with that gain, honour, and renown, grows negligent, falls into negligence, and being negligent, he lives in suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood. Passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark, he would cut off its twigs and leaves and take them away thinking they were heartwood. Then a man with good sight, seeing him, might say: 'This good man did not know the heartwood, the sapwood, the inner bark, the outer bark, or the twigs and leaves. Thus, while needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark, he cut off its twigs and leaves and took them away thinking they were heartwood. Whatever it was this good man had to make with heartwood, his purpose will not be served.' So too, bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith...<b>[193]</b>...he lives in suffering. This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the twigs and leaves of the holy life and stopped short with that.</p>

					<p class="f4">3.

He is not pleased with that gain, h~nour, and renown, and his intention is not fulfilled. He does not.. on account of it, laud himself and disparage others. He does not become intoxicated with that gain, honour, and renown; he does not grow negligent and fall into negligence. Being diligent, he achieves the attainment of virtue. He is pleased with that attainment of virtue and his intention is fulfilled. On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: 'I am virtuous, of good character, but these other bhikkhus are immoral, of evil character.' He becomes intoxicated with that attainment of virtue, grows negligent, falls into negligence, and being negligent, he lives in suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and cutting off only its heartwood, he would take it away knowing it was heartwood.

So too, bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith...When he is diligent, he attains perpetual liberation. And it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that perpetual deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "So this holy life, bhikkhus, does not have gain, honour, and renown for its benefit, or the attainment of virtue for its benefit, or the attainment of concentration for its benefit, or knowledge and vision for its benefit. But it is this unshakeable deliverance of mind that is the goal of this holy life, its heartwood, and its end."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn349" href="#n349">349</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n346" href="#fn346">346</a>]</sup></span> After Devadatta had unsuccessfully attempted to kill the Buddha and usurp control of the Saṅgha, he broke away from the Buddha and tried to establish his own sect with himself at the head. See Ñāṇamoli, <i>The Life of the Buddha,</i> pp. 266-69"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n347" href="#fn347">347</a>]</sup></span> "Knowledge and vision") (<i>ñāṇadassana</i>) here refers to the divine eye (MA), the ability to see subtle forms invisible to normal vision.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n348" href="#fn348">348</a>]</sup></span> This translation follows the BBS and SBJ eds., which read <i>asamayavimokkhaɱ</i> in the preceding sentence and <i>asamayavimuttiyā</i> in this sentence. The PTS ed., on which both Horner and Ñm based their translations, is evidently mistaken in reading <i>samaya</i> in the two compounds and <i>ṭhānaɱ</i> instead of <b>aṭṭhānaɱ</b>. MA cites the <i>Paṭisambhidāmagga</i> (ii.40) for a definition of <i>asamayavimokkha</i> (lit., non-temporary or "perpetual" liberation) as the four paths, four fruits, and Nibbana, and of <i>samayavimokkha</i> (temporary liberation) as the four <i>jhānas</i> and four formless attainments. See also <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p122">MN 122.4.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n349" href="#fn349">349</a>]</sup></span> "Unshakeable deliverance of mind" is the fruit of arahantship (MA). Thus "perpetual liberation" — as including all four paths and fruits — has a wider range of meaning than "unshakeable deliverance of mind," which alone is declared to be the goal of the holy life.</p>
