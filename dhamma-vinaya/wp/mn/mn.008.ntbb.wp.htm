On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
					Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahā Cunda rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Venerable sir, various views arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world. Now does the abandoning and relinquishing of those views come about in a bhikkhu who is attending only to the beginning [of his meditative training]?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cunda, as to those various views that arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world: if [the object] in relation to which those views arise, which they underlie, and which they are exercised upon is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,' then the abandoning and relinquishing of those views comes about.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Eight Attainments</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "It is possible here, Cunda, that quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But it is not these attainments that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called 'pleasant abidings here and now' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. "It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhāna, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But ... these are called 'pleasant abidings here and now' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture, some bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But ... these are called 'pleasant abidings here and now' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But it is not these attainments that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called 'pleasant abidings here and now' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. "It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite,' some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But it is not these attainments that are called 'effacement' in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called 'peaceful abidings' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. "It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite,' some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But ... these are called 'peaceful abidings' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But ... these are called 'peaceful abidings' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. "It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He might think thus: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But these attainments are not called 'effacement' in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called 'peaceful abidings' in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inclination of Mind</p>

					<p class="f4">13. "Cunda, I say that even the inclination of mind towards wholesome states is of great benefit, so what should be said of bodily and verbal acts conforming [to such a state of mind]? Therefore, Cunda:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(1) Mind should be inclined thus: 'Others will be cruel; we shall not be cruel here.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(2) Mind should be inclined thus: 'Others will kill living beings; we shall abstain from killing living beings here.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(3-43) Mind should be inclined thus: ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The Way Leading Upwards</p>

					<p class="f4">15. "Cunda, just as all unwholesome states lead downwards and all wholesome states lead upwards, so too:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(1) A person given to cruelty has non-cruelty to lead him upwards.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(2) One given to killing living beings has abstention from killing living beings to lead him upwards.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(3-43) One given to ... to lead him upwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Way of Extinguishing</p>

					<p class="f4">16. "Cunda, that one who is himself sinking in the mud should pull out another who is sinking in the mud is impossible; that one who is not himself sinking in the mud should pull out another who is sinking in the mud is possible. That one who is himself untamed, undisciplined, [with defilements] unextinguished, should tame another, discipline him, and help extinguish [his defilements] is impossible; that one who is himself tamed, disciplined, [with defilements] extinguished, should tame another, discipline him, and help extinguish [his defilements] is possible. So too:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(1) A person given to cruelty has non-cruelty by which to extinguish it.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(2) One given to killing living beings has abstention from killing living beings by which to extinguish it.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(3-43) One given to ... by which to extinguish it.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">(44) One given to adhere to his own views, who holds on to them tenaciously and relinquishes them with difficulty, has non-adherence to his own views, not holding on to them tenaciously and relinquishing them easily, by which to extinguish it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conclusion</p>

					<p class="f4">17. "So, Cunda, the way of effacement has been taught by me, the way of inclining the mind has been taught by me, the way of avoidance has been taught by me, the way leading upwards has been taught by me, and the way of extinguishing has been taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. "What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, Cunda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are these roots of trees, these empty huts. Meditate, Cunda, do not delay or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Mahā Cunda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
