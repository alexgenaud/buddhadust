On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends, bhikkhus." - "Friend," they replied. The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "'One of right view, one of right view,' is said, friends. In what way is a noble disciple one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma?"<sup>[<a id="fn114" href="#n114">114</a>]<br /> </sup>"Indeed, friend, we would come from far away to learn from the venerable Sāriputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the venerable Sāriputta would explain the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the unwholesome, what is the wholesome, what is the root of the wholesome? Killing living beings is unwholesome; taking what is not given is unwholesome; misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome; false speech is unwholesome; malicious speech is unwholesome; harsh speech is unwholesome; gossip is unwholesome; covetousness is unwholesome; ill will is unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome. This is called the unwholesome.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn115" href="#n115">115</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. "And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the unwholesome; hate is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a root of the unwholesome. This is called the root of the unwholesome.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn116" href="#n116">116</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">6. "And what is the wholesome? Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome; abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome; abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome; abstention from false speech is wholesome; abstention from malicious speech is wholesome; abstention from harsh speech is wholesome; abstention from gossip is wholesome; uncovetousness is wholesome; non-ill will is wholesome; right view is wholesome. This is called the wholesome.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn117" href="#n117">117</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">7. "And what is the root of the wholesome? Non-greed is a root of the wholesome; non-hate is a root of the wholesome; non-delusion is a root of the wholesome. This is called the root of the wholesome.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. "When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn118" href="#n118">118</a>]</sup></span> he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am,' and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of suffering.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn119" href="#n119">119</a>]</sup></span> In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Sāriputta's words. Then they asked him a further question: "But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma?" - "There might be, friends."</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the cessation of nutriment, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. "And what is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is the cessation of nutriment, what is the way leading to the cessation of nutriment? There are four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that already have come to be and for the support of those seeking a new existence. What four? They are: physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn120" href="#n120">120</a>]</sup></span> With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment. With the cessation of craving there is the cessation of nutriment. The way leading to the cessation of nutriment is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. "When a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment, the origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the cessation of nutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to greed, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am,' and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">13. Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Sāriputta's words. Then they asked him a further question: "But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma?" - "There might be, friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">14. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation of suffering, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. "And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is the cessation of suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? Birth is suffering; ageing is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. This is called suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">16. "And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. "And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of that same craving. This is called the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. "And what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

					<p class="f4">21. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands ageing and death, the origin of ageing and death, the cessation of ageing and death, and the way leading to the cessation of ageing and death, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn121" href="#n121">121</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">22. "And what is ageing and death, what is the origin of ageing and death, what is the cessation of ageing and death, what is the way leading to the cessation of ageing and death? The ageing of beings in the various orders of beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of faculties - this is called ageing. The passing of beings out of the various orders of beings, their passing away, dissolution, disappearance, dying, completion of time, dissolution of the aggregates<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn122" href="#n122">122</a>]</sup></span> laying down of the body - this is called death. So this ageing and this death are what is called ageing and death. With the arising of birth there is the arising of ageing and death. With the cessation of birth there is the cessation of ageing and death. The way leading to the cessation of ageing and death is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">26. "And what is birth, what is the origin of birth, what is the cessation of birth, what is the way leading to the cessation of birth? The birth of beings in the various orders of beings, their coming to birth, precipitation [in a womb], generation, manifestation of the aggregates, obtaining the bases for contact<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn123" href="#n123">123</a>]</sup></span> - this is called birth.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a> ]</sup> <i>MA:</i> Right view is twofold: mundane and supramundane. Mundane right view is again twofold: the view that kamma produces its fruits, which may be held both by Buddhists and outsiders, and the view that accords with the Four Noble Truths, which is exclusive to the Buddha's Dispensation. Supramundane right view is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths attained by penetrating to the four paths and fruits of sanctity. The question posed by the Ven.Sāriputta concerns the <i>sekha</i>, the disciple in higher training, who possesses supramundane right view leading irreversibly to emancipation. This is implied by the phrase "perfect confidence" and "arrived at this true Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a> ]</sup> Here the unwholesome (<i>akusala</i>) is explained by the ten unwholesome courses of action. The first three of these pertain to bodily action, the middle four to verbal action, the last three to mental action. The ten are explained at greater length at MN 41.8-10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a> ]</sup> These three are called the roots of the unwholesome because they motivate all unwholesome actions. For a thorough and informative textual study of these factors and their opposites, see Nyanaponika Thera, The Roots of Good and Evil.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a> ]</sup> These ten wholesome courses of action are elaborated upon in MN 41.12-14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a> ]</sup> <i>MA</i> explains the disciple's understanding of these four terms by way of the Four Noble Truths thus: all the courses of action are the truth of suffering; the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the origin; the non-occurrence of both actions and their roots is the truth of cessation; and the noble path that realises cessation is the truth of the path.To this extent a noble disciple at one of the first three stages has been described ­ one who has arrived at supramundane right view but has not yet eliminated all defilements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a> ]</sup> The passage from "he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust" until "he makes an end of suffering" shows the work accomplished by the paths of the non­returner and of arahantship-the elimination of the most subtle and obstinate defilements and the achievement of final knowledge. Here, the underlying tendencies to sensual lust and aversion are eliminated by the path of the non-returner, the underling tendency to the view and conceit "I am" and ignorance by the path of arahantship. <i>MA</i> explains that the expression "underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am"' (<i>asmī ti diṭṭhimānānusaya</i>) should be interpreted to mean the underlying tendency to conceit that is similar to a view because, like the view of self, it occurs apprehending the notion "I am."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a> ]</sup> Here I take <i>sambhavesinam</i> to be an instance of the (rare) future active participle in -<i>esin</i>. (See Norman, Elders' Verses I: Theragāthā, n.527, and Gelger, A Pāli Grammar, 193A.) The commentators, whom I have followed in the first edition of this work, take -<i>esin</i> as an adjectival formation from <i>esati</i>, to seek, and thus explain the phrase as meaning "those who are seeking a new existence." See too n. 514 below. Nutriment (<i>āhāra</i>) is to be understood here in a broad sense as a prominent condition for the individual life-continuity. Physical food (<i>kabalinkāra āhāra</i>) is an important condition for the physical body, contact for feeling, mental volition for consciousness, and consciousness for mentality-materiality, the psychophysical organism in its totality. Craving is called the origin of nutriment in that the craving of the previous existence is the source of the present individuality with its dependence upon and continual consumption of the four nutriments in this existence. For an annotated compilation of the canonical and commentarial texts on the nutriments, see Nyanaponika Thera, The Four Nutriments of Life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a> ]</sup> The next twelve sections present, in reverse order, a factor­by-factor examination of dependent origination. The principal terms of the formula are explained briefly in the Introduction, pp. 30-31. The detailed exegesis is in Vsm XVII. Here each factor is patterned after the Four Noble Truths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a> ]</sup> This refers to the five aggregates. See MN 10.38 and MN 44.2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a> ]</sup> The six bases for contact are enumerated at X50 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a> ]</sup> The three kinds of being are explained in the Introduction, pp. 46-48, in the discussion of Buddhist cosmology. Here, by "being" should be understood both the actual planes of rebirth and the types of kamma that generate rebirth into those planes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a> ]</sup> Clinging to rules and observances is the adherence to the view that purification can be achieved by adopting certain external rules or following certain observances, particularly of ascetic self-discipline; clinging to a doctrine of self is synonymous with identity view in one or another of its twenty forms (see MN 44.7); clinging to views is the clinging to all other types of views except the two mentioned separately. Clinging in any of its varieties represents a strengthening of craving, its condition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a> ]</sup> Craving for mind-objects (<i>dhammataṇhā</i>) is the craving for all objects of consciousness except the objects of the five kinds of sense consciousness.Examples would be the craving for fantasies and mental imagery, for abstract ideas and intellectual systems, for feelings and emotional states, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a> ]</sup> Contact (<i>phassa</i>) is explained at MN 18.16 as the meeting of sense faculty, its object, and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a> ]</sup> Mind-base (<i>manāyatana</i>) is a collective term for all classes of consciousness. One part of this base - the "life continuum" (<i>bhavanga</i>) or subliminal consciousness - is the "door" for the arising of mind-consciousness. See n.130.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a> ]</sup> Mentality-materiality (<i>nāmarüpa</i>) is an umbrella term for the psychophysical organism exclusive of consciousness. The five mental factors mentioned under nāma are indispensable to consciousness and thus pertain to all conscious experience. The four great elements concretely represent matter's essential properties of solidity, cohesion, heat, and distension. The material form derived from the elements includes, according to the Abhidhamma analysis, the sensitive substance of the five sense faculties; four sense objects-colour, sound, smell, and taste (tangibles being the three elements of earth, fire, and air); the physical life faculty, nutritive essence, sex determination, and other types of material phenomena. See also the Introduction, p. 56.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a> ]</sup> Mind-consciousness (<i>manoviññāṇa</i>) comprises all consciousness except the five types of sense consciousness just mentioned.It includes consciousness of mental images, abstract ideas, and internal states of mind, as well as the consciousness in reflection upon sense objects.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a> ]</sup> In the context of the doctrine of dependent origination, formations (<i>sankhārā</i>) are wholesome and unwholesome volitions, or, in short, kamma. The bodily formation is volition that is expressed through the body, the verbal formation volition that is expressed by speech, and the mental formation volition that remains internal without coming to bodily or verbal expression.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a> ]</sup> It should be noted that while ignorance is a condition for the taints, the taints - which include the taint of ignorance - are in turn a condition for ignorance. <i>MA</i> says that this conditioning of ignorance by ignorance should be understood to mean that the ignorance in any one existence is conditioned by the ignorance in the preceding existence. Since this is so, the conclusion follows that no first point can be discovered for ignorance, and thus that saɱsāra is without discernible beginning.</p>
