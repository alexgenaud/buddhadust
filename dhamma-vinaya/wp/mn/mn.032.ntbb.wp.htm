A group of the Buddha's great disciples gather together on a beautiful moonlit night in Gosinga Woods with the air perfumed by the Sal Tree blossoms.

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Park of the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood together with a number of very well-known elder disciples — the venerable Sāriputta the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable Ānanda, and other very well known elder disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, rose from meditation, went to the venerable Mahā Kassapa, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Kassapa, let us go to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the venerable Mahā Kassapa replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa, and the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. The venerable Ānandasaw them going to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he went to the venerable Revata and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Revata, those true men are going to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us also go to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the venerable Revata replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Revata and the venerable Ānanda went to the venerable Sāriputta to listen to the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. The venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Revata and the venerable Ānandacoming in the distance and said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the venerable Ānanda come, welcome to the venerable Ānanda, the Blessed One's attendant, who is always in the Blessed One's presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Ānanda, the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sālasāla trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ānanda, could illuminate the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates what he has learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such teachings as are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure — such teachings as these he has learned much of, remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies.</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">5. When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Revata thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Revata, the venerable Ānandahas spoken according to his own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now we ask the venerable Revata: Friend Revata, the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sāla trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Revata, could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditation and takes delight in solitary meditation; he is devoted to internal serenity of mind, does not neglect meditation, possesses insight, and dwells in empty huts.</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">6. When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anuruddha, the venerable Revata has spoken according to his own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha: Friend Anuruddha, the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Anuruddha, could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Sāriputta with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, a bhikkhu surveys a thousand worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man with good sight, when he has ascended to the upper palace chamber, might survey a thousand wheel-rims, so too, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, a bhikkhu surveys a thousand worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">7. When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahā Kassapa thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha has spoken according to his own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now we ask the venerable Mahā Kassapa: Friend Kassapa, the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Kassapa, could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu is a forest dweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwelling; he is an almsfood eater himself and speaks in praise of eating almsfood; he is a refuse-rag wearer himself and speaks in praise of wearing refuse-rag robes; he is a triple-robe wearer himself and speaks in praise of wearing the triple robe; he has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes; he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment; he is secluded himself and speaks in praise of seclusion; he is aloof from society himself and speaks in praise of aloofness from society; he is energetic himself and speaks in praise of arousing energy; he has attained to virtue himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of virtue; he has attained to concentration himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of concentration; he has attained to wisdom himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of wisdom; he has attained to deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of deliverance; he has attained to the knowledge and vision of deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the knowledge and vision of deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">8. When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Moggallāna, the venerable Mahā Kassapa  has spoken according to his own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now we ask the venerable Mahā Moggallāna: Friend Moggallāna,  the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallāna,  could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Sāriputta two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma and they question each other, and each being questioned by the other answers without foundering, and their talk rolls on in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. When this was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta we have all spoken according to our own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now we ask the venerable Sāriputta: Friend Sāriputta the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sāla trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Sāriputta could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Moggallāna,  a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he does not let the mind wield mastery over him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the morning; at midday he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in at midday; in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a king or a king's minister had a chest full of variously coloured garments.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on in the morning; at midday he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on at midday; in the evening he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on in the evening.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he does not let the mind wield mastery over him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning ...</p>

					<p class="f4">at midday ...</p>

					<p class="f4">in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening.</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed those venerable ones thus: "Friends, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the Blessed One answers, so let us remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," they replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those venerable ones went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">11. "Venerable sir, the venerable Revata and the venerable Ānanda came to me to listen to the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I saw them coming in the distance and said to the venerable Ānanda: 'Let the venerable Ānanda come, welcome to the venerable Ānanda...</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Ānanda, the Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ānanda, could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked, venerable sir, the venerable Ānandareplied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu has learned much ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/as in §4/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Ānandahas learned much, remembers what he has learned, and consolidates what he has learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such teachings as are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure — such teachings as these he has learned much of, remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and penetrated well by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he teaches the Dhamma to the four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for the eradication of the underlying tendencies."</p>

					<p class="f4">12. "When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Revata thus: 'Friend Revata ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Revata replied: 'Here, friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditation ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/as in §5/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revata, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Revata delights in solitary meditation, takes delight in solitary meditation, is devoted to internal serenity of mind, does not neglect meditation, possesses insight, and dwells in empty huts."</p>

					<p class="f4">13. "When that was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Anuruddha ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Anuruddha replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, friend Sāriputta with the divine eye ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/as in §6/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anuruddha, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">For with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, Anuruddha surveys a thousand worlds."</p>

					<p class="f4">14. "When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Mahā Kassapa thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Kassapa ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Kassapa replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, friend Sāriputta a bhikkhu is a forest-dweller himself ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/as in §7/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa, speaking rightly, should speak just as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Kassapa is a forest-dweller himself and speaks in praise of forest dwelling ...</p>

					<p class="f4">he has attained to the knowledge and vision of deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the knowledge and vision of deliverance."</p>

					<p class="f4">15. "When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, thus: 'Friend Moggallāna ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, friend Sāriputta two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/as in §8/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moggallāna,  speaking rightly, should speak just as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Moggallāna is one who talks on the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">16. When that was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, told the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Sāriputta thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Sāriputta ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, friend Moggallāna,  a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/as in §9/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Moggallāna</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta speaking rightly, should speak just as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Sāriputta wields mastery over his mind, he does not let the mind wield mastery over him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the morning; at midday he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in at midday; in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening."</p>

					<p class="f4">17. When this was said, the venerable Sāriputta asked the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, which of us has spoken well?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"You have all spoken well, Sāriputta each in his own way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hear also from me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="resolve">Here,</a> Sāriputta when a bhikkhu has returned from his almsround, after his meal, he sits down, folds his legs crosswise, sets his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him, resolves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those venerable ones were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
