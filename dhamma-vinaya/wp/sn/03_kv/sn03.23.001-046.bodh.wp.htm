					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n239" href="#fn239">239</a>]</sup> DPPN 2:730 explains that he was a brahmin of Rājagaha who had become a monk in his old age. The Buddha declared him the foremost of those who could inspire ingenuity in others (<i>etadaggaɱ paṭibhāṇakeyyānaɱ</i>; AN I 25,15). He has two verses at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/radha.htm">Th 133-34</a> (= Dhp 13-14).<br />
					Spk: Whenever the Tathagata saw this elder, a subtle topic occurred to him. Thus the Blessed One taught him the Dhamma in various ways. In this Saɱyutta, two vaggas have come down by way of questions, a third by way of request, and a fourth by way of intimate discourse (<i>upanisinnakakathā</i>, lit. "sitting nearby talk").</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n240" href="#fn240">240</a>]</sup> Spk: Here "Mara" is a metaphor for death and the aggregates (<i>maraṇa-māra, khandha-māra</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n241" href="#fn241">241</a>]</sup> <i>Māro vā assa māretā vā yo vii pana miyati</i>. Spk glosses <i>māretā</i> with <i>māretabbo</i>, but the word is clearly an agent noun with an active sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n242" href="#fn242">242</a>]</sup> <i>Vimutti kho Rādha nibbānatthā</i>. Spk: This "liberation of the fruit" is for the purpose of Nibbāna without clinging (<i>phalavimutti nām'esā anupādānibbānatthā</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n243" href="#fn243">243</a>]</sup> This paragraph is also at 48:42 (V 218,19-21) and MN I 304,20-22. Be consistently reads the verb as <i>accayāsi</i> (aorist of <i>atiyāti</i>), Se as <i>accasarā</i> (aorist of <i>atisarati</i>). Ee's <i>assa</i> here and <i>ajjhaparam</i> below must stem from faulty manuscripts.<br />
					The last sentence is: <i>Nibbānogadhaɱ hi Rādha brahmacariyaɱ vussati nibbānaparāyanaɱ nibbānapariyosānaɱ</i>. Many translators take <i>nibbānogadha</i> to mean "the plunge into Nibbāna" or "merging with Nibbāna," which the commentaries encourage by connecting <i>ogadha</i> with <i>ogāha</i>, a plunge (from the verb <i>ogāhati</i>, to plunge into). But <i>ogadha</i> is actually a by-form of <i>ogādha</i>, from the verb ogādhati, which the commentaries treat as synonymous with <i>patiṭṭhahati</i>, "to be established." They confirm this link by consistently glossing <i>ogadha</i> with <i>patiṭṭhā</i>, support; hence my rendering "ground." For the references, see CPD, s.v. <i>ogadha, ogādhati, ogāha,</i> and the use of the word <i>gādha</i>, both literal and metaphorical, in I, v. 263. MW defines <i>gādha</i> (from the root <i>gādh</i>, to stand firmly) as a ground for standing on in water, a shallow place, a ford.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n244" href="#fn244">244</a>][<a id="n244a" href="#fn244a">244a</a>]</sup> This reply hinges on a pun between <i>satta</i> as the Pali equivalent of Skt <i>sattva</i>, "a being," and as the past participle of <i>sajjat</i>i (= Skt <i>sakta</i>), "attached."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n245" href="#fn245">245</a>]</sup> I read <i>dhanāyanti</i> with Be and Se, glossed <i>dhanaɱ viya maññanti</i> by Spk.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n246" href="#fn246">246</a>]</sup> I follow Se. Be reads <i>bhavanetti-nirodho</i> twice, Ee <i>bhavanetti bhavanetti-nirodho. Bhavanetti</i>, lit. "what leads to existence," is glossed <i>bhavarajju</i>, "rope of existence," by Spk. The expression is a synonym of <i>bhavataṇhā</i>, craving for existence, and often occurs in verse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n247" href="#fn247">247</a>]</sup> A partly similar series of terms is met at 12:15. See II, nn. 31, 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n248" href="#fn248">248</a>]</sup> <i>Māradhamma</i>. Spk glosses with <i>maraṇadhamma</i>, "subject to death." In some of the suttas that follow (namely, in relation to impermanence, suffering, and nonself), I translate the suffix -dhamma as "nature" rather than "subject to."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n218" href="#fn218">218</a>]</sup> Spk glosses <i>pariññeyya</i> with <i>samatikkamitabbil</i> and <i>pariññā</i> with <i>samatikkama</i>; see n. 41. The "person who has fully understood" (pariññātāvī) is a conventional expression; see n.37.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n219" href="#fn219">219</a>]</sup> Spk: By this, Nibbana is shown.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n220" href="#fn220">220</a>]</sup> Woodward, at KS 3:136, says that this sutta is the same as the preceding one, but that is not the case; this one adds <i>samudayañ ca atthangamañ ca</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n221" href="#fn221">221</a>]</sup> The stream-enterer (in the preceding sutta) and the arahant share the same understanding of the five aggregates. They differ in that the arahant has used this understanding to extricate all defilements, while the stream-enterer (and higher trainees) have yet to complete this task. Note too that whereas the stream-enterer is explained in terms of a noble disciple, the arahant is always defined as a bhikkhu.</p>
