					<p class="f4">... The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Ānanda as he was sitting to one side:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Ānanda, they were to ask you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Ānanda, what are the things of which an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned?</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the things of which an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned?</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the things of which an arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is discerned?'</p>

					<p class="f4">— being asked thus, Ānanda, how would you answer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, with form that has passed, ceased, changed, an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness that has passed, ceased, changed, an arising was discerned, a vanishing was discerned, an alteration of that which stands was discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is of these things, friends, that an arising was discerned, that a vanishing was discerned, that an alteration of that which stands was discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Friends, with form that has not been born, not become manifest, an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness that has not been born, not become manifest, an arising will be discerned, a vanishing will be discerned, an alteration of that which stands will be discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness that has been born, that has become manifest, an arising is discerned, a vanishing is discerned, an alteration of that which stands is discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is of these things, friends, that an arising is discerned, that a vanishing is discerned, that an alteration of that which stands is discerned.'</p>
