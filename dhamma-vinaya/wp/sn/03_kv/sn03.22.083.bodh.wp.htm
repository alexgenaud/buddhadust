					<p class="f4">There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend." those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Ānanda said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exhorted us with the following exhortation:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is by clinging, Ānanda, that [the notion] 'I am' occurs, not without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">And by clinging to what does 'I am' occur, not without clinging?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by clinging to form that 'I am' occurs, not without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by clinging to feeling ... to perception ... to volitional formations ... to consciousness that 'I am' occurs, not without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, friend Ānanda, a young woman — or a man — youthful and fond of ornaments, would examine her own facial image in a mirror or in a bowl filled with pure, clear, clean water: she would look at it with clinging, not without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, it is by clinging to form that 'I am' occurs, not without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by clinging to feeling ... to perception ... to volitional formations ... to consciousness that 'I am' occurs, not without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, friend Ānanda, is form permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">... <i>(as in <a href="sn03.22.082.bodh.wp.htm">preceding sutta</a>)</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'... there is no more for this state of being."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāniputta <a id="pt106" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.083.pali.bd.htm#pg106"><span class="f2">[106]</span></a> was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exhorted us with that exhortation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I heard his Dhamma teaching I made the breakthrough to the Dhamma."</p>
