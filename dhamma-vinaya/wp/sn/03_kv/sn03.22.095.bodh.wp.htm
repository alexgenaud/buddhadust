					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.095.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.095.wood.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.095.than.ati.htm#p1">than</a>]</span> On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ayojjhā on the bank of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump of foam.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in a lump of foam?</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of form there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: <a id="pt141" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.095.pali.bd.htm#pg141"><span class="f2">[141]</span></a> a bhikkhu inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in form?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, that in the autumn, when it is raining and big rain drops are falling, a water bubble arises and bursts on the surface of the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in a water bubble?</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of feeling there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a bhikkhu inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, that in the last month of the hot season, at high noon, a shimmering mirage appears.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in a mirage?</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of perception there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a bhikkhu inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, that a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, would take a sharp axe and enter a forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he would see the trunk of a large plantain tree, straight, fresh, without a fruit-bud core.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would cut it down at the root, cut off the crown, and unroll the coil.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he unrolls the coil, he would not find even softwood, let alone heartwood.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, <a id="pt142" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.095.pali.bd.htm#pg142"><span class="f2">[142]</span></a> and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in the trunk of a plantain tree?</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of volitional formations there are, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a bhikkhu inspects them, ponders them, and carefully investigates them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he investigates them, they appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, that a magician or a magician's apprentice would display a magical illusion at a crossroads.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in a magical illusion?</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of consciousness there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a bhikkhu inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void, hollow, insubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what substance could there be in consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Form is like a lump of foam,<br />
							Feeling like a water bubble;<br />
							Perception is like a mirage,<br />
							Volitions like a plantain trunk,<br />
							And consciousness like an illusion,<br />
							So explained the Kinsman of the Sun.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"However one may ponder it<br />
							And carefully investigate it,<br />
							It appears but hollow and void<br />
							When one views it carefully.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt143" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.095.pali.bd.htm#pg143"><span class="f2">[143]</span></a> "With reference to this body<br />
							The One of Broad Wisdom has taught<br />
							That with the abandoning of three things<br />
							One sees this form discarded.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When vitality, heat, and consciousness<br />
							Depart from this physical body,<br />
							Then it lies there cast away:<br />
							Food for others, without volition.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Such is this continuum,<br />
							This illusion, beguiler of fools.<br />
							It is taught to be a murderer;<br />
							Here no substance can be found.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"A bhikkhu with energy aroused<br />
							Should look upon the aggregates thus,<br />
							Whether by day or at night,<br />
							Comprehending, ever mindful.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"He should discard all the fetters<br />
							And make a refuge for himself;<br />
							Let him fare as with head ablaze,<br />
							Yearning for the imperishable state."</p>
