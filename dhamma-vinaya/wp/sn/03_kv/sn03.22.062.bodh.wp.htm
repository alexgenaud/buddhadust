					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever form, bhikkhus, has passed, ceased, changed: the term, label, and description 'was' applies to it, not the term 'is' or the term 'will be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever form, bhikkhus, has not been born, has not become manifest: the term, label, and description 'will be' applies to it, not the term 'is' or the term 'was.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever feeling ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever perception ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever volitional formations ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, even Vassa and Bañña of Ukkalā, proponents of noncausality, of the inefficacy of action, and of nihilism, did not think that these three pathways of language, pathways of designation, pathways of description should be criticized or scorned.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they fear blame, attack, and condemnation."</p>
