					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the gratification, what is the danger, what is the escape in the case of form?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the gratification, what is the danger, what is the escape in the case of feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt28" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.026.pali.bd.htm#pg28"><span class="f2">[28]</span></a> "Then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on form: this is the gratification in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">That form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is the danger in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for form: this is the escape from form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feeling ... in dependence on perception ... in dependence on volitional formations ... in dependence on consciousness: this is the gratification in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is the danger in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for consciousness: this is the escape from consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these five aggregates subject to clinging, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I directly knew all this as it really is, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with ... its devas and humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The knowledge and vision arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence."</p>
