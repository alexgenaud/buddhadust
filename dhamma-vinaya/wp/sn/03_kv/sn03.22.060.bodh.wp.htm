					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahāli the Licchavi approached the Blessed One <a id="pt69" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.060.pali.bd.htm#pg69"><span class="f2">[69]</span></a> ... and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified without cause or condition.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the Blessed One say about this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is, Mahāli, a cause and condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled with cause and condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a cause and condition for the purification of beings; beings are purified with cause and condition."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, venerable sir, what is the cause and condition for the defilement of beings?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that beings are defiled with cause and condition?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Mahāli, this form were exclusively suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and if it were not [also] steeped in pleasure, beings would not become enamoured with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because form is pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and is not steeped [only] in suffering, beings become enamoured with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">By being enamoured with it, they are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Mahāli, is a cause and condition for the defilement of beings; it is thus that beings are defiled with cause and condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Mahāli, this feeling were exclusively suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">If this perception ... these volitional formations ... <a id="pt70" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.060.pali.bd.htm#pg70"><span class="f2">[70]</span></a> ... this consciousness were exclusively suffering ... beings would not become enamoured with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because consciousness is pleasurable ... beings become enamoured with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">By being enamoured with it, they are captivated by it, and by being captivated by it they are defiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahāli, is a cause and condition for the defilement of beings; it is thus that beings are defiled with cause and condition."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, venerable sir, what is the cause and condition for the purification of beings?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that beings are purified with cause and condition?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Mahāli, this form were exclusively pleasurable, immersed in pleasure, steeped in pleasure, and if it were not [also] steeped in suffering, beings would not experience revulsion towards it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because form is suffering, immersed in suffering, steeped in suffering, and is not steeped [only] in pleasure, beings experience revulsion towards it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, they become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Mahāli, is a cause and condition for the purification of beings; it is thus that beings are purified with cause and condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Mahāli, this feeling were exclusively pleasurable ...</p>

					<p class="f4">If this perception ... these volitional formations ... this consciousness were exclusively pleasurable ... beings would not experience revulsion towards it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because consciousness is suffering ... beings experience revulsion towards it. Experiencing revulsion, they become dispassionate, and through dispassion they are purified.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt71" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.060.pali.bd.htm#pg71"><span class="f2">[71]</span></a> This too, Mahāli, is a cause and condition for the purification of beings; it is thus that beings are purified with cause and condition."</p>
