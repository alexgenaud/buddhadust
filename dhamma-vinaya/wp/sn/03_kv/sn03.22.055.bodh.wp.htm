					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It might not be, and it might not be for me;<br />
					it will not be, [and] it will not be for me':</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt56" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.055.pali.bd.htm#pg56"><span class="f2">[56]</span></a> resolving thus, a bhikkhu can cut off the lower fetters."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, venerable sir, can a bhikkhu, resolving thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It might not be, and it might not be for me;<br />
					it will not be, [and] it will not be for me,'</p>

					<p class="f4">cut off the lower fetters?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones ... regards form as self ... or self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not understand as it really is impermanent form as 'impermanent form' ... impermanent feeling as 'impermanent feeling' ... impermanent perception as 'impermanent perception' ... impermanent volitional formations as 'impermanent volitional formations' ... impermanent consciousness as 'impermanent consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not understand as it really is painful form as 'painful form' ... painful feeling as 'painful feeling' ... painful perception as 'painful perception' ... painful volitional formations as 'painful volitional formations' ... painful consciousness as 'painful consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not understand as it really is selfless form as 'selfless form' ... selfless feeling as 'selfless feeling' ... selfless perception as 'selfless perception' ... selfless volitional formations as 'selfless volitional formations' ... selfless consciousness as 'selfless consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not understand as it really is conditioned form as 'conditioned form' ... conditioned feeling as 'conditioned feeling' ... conditioned perception as 'conditioned perception' ... conditioned volitional formations as 'conditioned volitional formations' ... conditioned consciousness as 'conditioned consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not understand as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Form will be exterminated' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling will be exterminated' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Perception will be exterminated' ... </p>

					<p class="f4">'Volitional formations will be exterminated' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Consciousness will be exterminated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He understands as it really is impermanent form as 'impermanent form' ... impermanent consciousness as 'impermanent consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He understands as it really is painful form as 'painful form' ... painful consciousness as 'painful consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"With the extermination of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness, that bhikkhu, resolving thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">can cut off the lower fetters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Resolving thus, venerable sir, a bhikkhu can cut off the lower fetters.</p>

					<p class="f4">But how should one know, how should one see, for the immediate destruction of the taints to occur?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling becomes frightened over an unfrightening matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is frightening to the uninstructed worldling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It might not be, and it might not be for me;<br />
					it will not be, [and] it will not be for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the instructed noble disciple does not become frightened over an unfrightening matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is not frightening to the noble disciple:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhu, though someone might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Apart from form, apart from feeling, apart from perception, apart from volitional formations, I will make known the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and rebirth, its growth, increase, and expansion'</p>

					<p class="f4">— that is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhu, if a bhikkhu has abandoned lust for the form element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he has abandoned lust for the feeling element ... for the perception element ... for the volitional formations element ... for the consciousness element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When that consciousness is unestablished, not coming to growth, nongenerative, it is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being unagitated, he personally attains  Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, bhikkhu, for one who knows thus, for one who sees thus, that the immediate destruction of the taints occurs."</p>
