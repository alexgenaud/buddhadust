<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Khandha Vagga, Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 100. The Buddha likens the way the commoner runs around after shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness to the way a dog tied to a post runs round and round the post and never gets free of the post. Then he likens the creativity of mind in devising the taints that corrupt individuals to that of the hypnotist creating an illusion, to nature in devising the various forms of animals, or to an artest creating an image of a man or a woman." />

					<p class="f4">A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, a dog tied up on a leash was bound to a strong post or pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it walks, it walks close to that post or pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it stands, it stands close to that post or pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it sits down, it sits down close to that post or pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it lies down, it lies down close to that post or pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling regards form thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he walks, he walks close to those five aggregates subject to clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he stands, he stands close to those five aggregates subject to clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he sits down, he sits down close to those five aggregates subject to clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he lies down, he lies down close to those five aggregates subject to clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, one should often reflect upon one's own mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust, hatred, and delusion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Through the defilements of the mind beings are defiled; with the cleansing of the mind beings are purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, have you seen the picture called 'Faring On'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even that picture called 'Faring On' has been designed in its diversity by the mind, yet the mind is even more diverse than that picture called 'Faring On.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, one should often reflect upon one's own mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust, hatred, and delusion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Through the defilements of the mind beings are defiled; with the cleansing of the mind beings are purified.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt152" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.100.pali.bd.htm#pg152"><span class="f2">[152]</span></a> "Bhikkhus, I do not see any other order of living beings so diversified as those in the animal realm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even those beings in the animal realm have been diversified by the mind, yet the mind is even more diverse than those beings in the animal realm.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, one should often reflect upon one's own mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For a long time this mind has been defiled by lust, hatred, and delusion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Through the defilements of the mind beings are defiled; with the cleansing of the mind beings are purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, an artist or a painter, using dye or lac or turmeric or indigo or crimson, would create the figure of a man or a woman complete in all its features on a well-polished plank or wall or canvas.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when the uninstructed worldling produces anything, it is only form that he produces; only feeling that he produces; only perception that he produces; only volitional formations that he produces; only consciousness that he produces.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing thus ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'... there is no more for this state of being."</p>
