<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Khandha Vagga, Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 47. Whoever holds opinions concerning the self does so with the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness in mind. With one or another of these things giving rise to thoughts of 'I am' or 'it is', there arises experience through the six senses and with the experience, the conviction that these things exist. Seeing this as it is, it can be let go and those convictions disappear." />

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, those ascetics and brahmins who regard [anything as] self in various ways all regard [as self] the five aggregates subject to clinging, or a certain one among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional formations as self ... consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus this way of regarding things and [the notion] 'I am' have not vanished in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">As 'I am' has not vanished, there takes place a descent of the five faculties — of the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, the body faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, bhikkhus, the mind, there are mental phenomena, there is the element of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a feeling born of ignorance-contact, 'I am' occurs to him; 'I am this' occurs to him; 'I will be' and 'I will not be,' and 'I will consist of form' and 'I will be formless,' and 'I will be percipient' and 'I will be nonpercipient' and 'I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' — these occur to him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt47" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.047.pali.bd.htm#pg47"><span class="f2">[47]</span></a> "The five faculties remain right there, bhikkhus, but in regard to them the instructed noble disciple abandons ignorance and arouses true knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge, 'I am' does not occur to him; 'I am this' does not occur to him; 'I will be' and 'I will not be,' and 'I will consist of form' and 'I will be formless,' and 'I will be percipient' and 'I will be nonpercipient' and 'I will be neither percipient nor nonpercipient' — these do not occur to him."</p>
