					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, suppose there was a mountain river sweeping downwards, flowing into the distance with a swift current.</p>

					<p class="f4">If on either bank of the river <i>Kāsa</i> grass or <i>kusa</i> grass were to grow, it would overhang it; if rushes, reeds, or trees were to grow, they would overhang it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man being carried along by the current should grasp the <i>Kāsa</i> grass, it would break off and he would thereby meet with calamity and disaster; if he should grasp the <i>kusa</i> grass, it would break off and he would thereby meet with calamity and disaster; if he should grasp the rushes, reeds, or trees, <a id="pt138" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.093.pali.bd.htm#pg138"><span class="f2">[138]</span></a> they would break off and he would thereby meet with calamity and disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling ... regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">That form of his disintegrates and he thereby meets with calamity and disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional formations as self ... consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That consciousness of his disintegrates and he thereby meets with calamity and disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, bhikkhus, is form permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>
