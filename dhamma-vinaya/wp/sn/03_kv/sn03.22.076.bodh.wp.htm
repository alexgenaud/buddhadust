					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.076.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.076.wood.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> At Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, form is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself <a id="pt83" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.076.pali.bd.htm#pg83"><span class="f2">[83]</span></a> should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Volitional formations are impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"To whatever extent, bhikkhus, there are abodes of beings, even up to the pinnacle of existence, these are the foremost in the world, these are the best, that is, the arahants."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Happy indeed are the arahants!<br />
							No craving can be found in them.<br />
							Cut off is the conceit 'I am,'<br />
							Burst asunder is delusion's net.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"They have reached the unstirred state,<br />
							Limpid are their minds;<br />
							They are unsullied in the world —<br />
							The holy ones, without taints.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Having fully understood the five aggregates,<br />
							Ranging in the seven good qualities,<br />
							Those praiseworthy superior men<br />
							Are the Buddha's bosom sons.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Endowed with the seven gems,<br />
							Trained in the threefold training,<br />
							Those great heroes wander about<br />
							With fear and trembling abandoned.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Endowed with the ten factors,<br />
							Those great nāgas, concentrated,<br />
							Are the best beings in the world:<br />
							No craving can be found in them.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The adepts' knowledge has arisen in them:<br />
							'This body is the last I bear.'<br />
							In regard to the core of the holy life<br />
							They no longer depend on others.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt84" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.076.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><span class="f2">[84]</span></a> "They do not waver in discrimination,<br />
							They are released from renewed existence.<br />
							Having reached the stage of the tamed,<br />
							They are the victors in the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Above, across, and below,<br />
							Delight is no more found in them.<br />
							They boldly sound their lion's roar:<br />
							'The enlightened are supreme in the world."</p>
