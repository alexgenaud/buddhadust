Venerable Assaji is suffering an illness which prevents him from attaining jhana and he is worried about falling away. The Buddha explains to him that the essence of his teaching is not the attaining of jhana, and he instructs him in such a way as to bring about Assaji's arahantship." />

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Assaji was dwelling at Kassapaka's Park, sick, afflicted, gravely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(As in <a href="sn03.22.087.bodh.wp.htm">preceding sutta,</a> down to:)</i> <a id="pt125" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.088.pali.bd.htm#pg125"><span class="f2">[125]</span></a> "Then if you have nothing for which to reproach yourself in re-gard to virtue, Assaji, why are you troubled by remorse and regret?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, venerable sir, when I was ill I kept on tranquillizing the bodily formations, but [now] I do not obtain concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I do not obtain concentration, it occurs to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let me not fall away!."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those ascetics and brahmins, Assaji, who regard concentration as the essence and identify concentration with asceticism, failing to obtain concentration, might think, 'Let us not fall away!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Assaji, is form permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">... <a id="pt126" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.088.pali.bd.htm#pg126"><span class="f2">[126]</span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing thus ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'... there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent'; he understands: 'It is not held to'; he understands: 'It is not delighted in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a painful feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent'; he understands: 'It is not held to'; he understands: 'It is not delighted in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent'; he understands: 'It is not held to'; he understands: 'It is not delighted in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I feel a feeling terminating with the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling terminating with life, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I feel a feeling terminating with life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, Assaji, an oil lamp burns in dependence on the oil and the wick, and with the exhaustion of the oil and the wick it is extinguished through lack of fuel, so too, Assaji, when a bhikkhu feels a feeling terminating with the body ... terminating with life ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here."</p>
