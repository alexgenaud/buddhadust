					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> These words are identical with the Buddha's famous injunction to Ānanda in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (at DN II 100,20-22), also below at 47:9, 13, 14 (V 154,5-6, 163,10-11, 164,28-29). In explaining the expression <i>attadipa,</i> "with self as island," Spk says: "What is meant by 'self'? The mundane and supramundane Dhamma (ko pan'ettha attā nama? lokiyalokuttaro dhammo). Therefore he says next, 'with the Dhamma as an island,' etc." This comment overlooks the obvious point that the Buddha is inculcating self-reliance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> The Se reading seems best: yoni yeva upaparikkhitabbā. Be omits <i>yeva</i> and Ee treats <i>yoni</i> as a masculine noun. Spk glosses <i>yoni</i> with <i>kāraṇa,</i> "cause," and refers to MN III 142,23-24: <i>yoni h'esā Bhūmija phalassa adhigamāya</i>; "For this, Bhūmija, is the basis for the achievement of the fruit." See too 35:239 (IV 175,27-28) and AN II 76,24-25. Spkpṭ offers an etymology: <i>yavati etasmā phalaɱ pasavatī ti yoni</i>. At 22:95 we repeatedly find the phrase <i>yoniso upaparikkhati,</i> "carefully investigates," and it is quite possible that here too <i>yoniso</i> was the original reading. A Burmese v.l. cited by Ee actually has <i>yoniso va</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> <i>Na paritassati.</i> See n. 33 above and II, n. 137.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> <i>Tadaṅganibbuto ti vuccati.</i> Though <i>nibbuto</i> is the past participle generally used to describe one who has attained <i>Nibbāna,</i> the prefix <i>tadaṅga-</i> qualifies that sense, suggesting he has not actually attained <i>Nibbāna</i> but has only approximated its attainment. One might have rendered this expression "one who has attained <i>Nibbāna</i> in that respect," i.e., only in respect of a particular freedom. Spk: He is "quenched in that respect" because of the quenching of the defilements with respect to (or: through the factor of) insight. In this sutta it is just insight (<i>vipassanā va</i>) that is discussed.</p>
