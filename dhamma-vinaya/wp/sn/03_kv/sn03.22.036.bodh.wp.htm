					<p class="f4">Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhu, if one has an underlying tendency towards something, then one is measured in accordance with it; if one is measured in accordance with something, then one is reckoned in terms of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one does not have an underlying tendency towards something, then one is not measured in accordance with it; if one is not measured in accordance with something, then one is not reckoned in terms of it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Understood, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Understood, Fortunate One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, venerable sir, one has an underlying tendency towards form, then one is measured in accordance with it; if one is measured in accordance with it, then one is reckoned in terms of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one has an underlying tendency towards feeling ... towards perception ... towards volitional formations ... towards consciousness, then one is measured in accordance with it; if one is measured in accordance with it, then one is reckoned in terms of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, venerable sir, one does not have an underlying tendency towards form, then one is not measured in accordance with it; <a id="pt37" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.036.pali.bd.htm#pg37"><span class="f2">[37]</span></a> if one is not measured in accordance with it, then one is not reckoned in terms of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in such a way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, bhikkhu!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, bhikkhu, one has an underlying tendency towards form ... <i>(as above in full)</i> ... then one is not reckoned in terms of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that bhikkhu, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat ...</p>
