					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.wood.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.than.ati.htm#p1">than</a>]</span> On one occasion a number of bhikkhus were dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Venerable Channa emerged from seclusion and, taking his key, went from dwelling to dwelling saying to the elder bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the elder venerable ones exhort me, let them instruct me, let them give me a Dhamma talk in such a way that I might see the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the elder bhikkhus said to the Venerable Channa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Form, friend Channa, is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is impermanent, volitional formations are impermanent, consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Form is nonself, <a id="pt133" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.pali.bd.htm#pg133"><span class="f2">[133]</span></a> feeling is nonself, perception is nonself, volitional formations are nonself, consciousness is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">All formations are impermanent; all phenomena are nonself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Venerable Channa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I too think in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Form is impermanent ... consciousness is impermanent. Form is nonself ... consciousness is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">All formations are impermanent; all phenomena are nonself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But my mind does not launch out upon the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna; nor does it acquire confidence, settle down, and resolve on it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead, agitation and clinging arise and the mind turns back, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But who is my self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">But such does not happen to one who sees the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">So who can teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might see the Dhamma?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Venerable Channa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This Venerable Ānanda is dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park, and he has been praised by the Teacher and is esteemed by his wise brothers in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Ānandais capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might see the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since I have so much trust in the Venerable Ānanda, let me approach him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Channa set his lodging in order, took his bowl and robe, and went to Ghosita's Park in <span class="mozp">Kosambī ,</span>where he approached the Venerable Ānandaand exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and told the Venerable Ānanda everything that had happened, adding:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt134" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.pali.bd.htm#pg134"><span class="f2">[134]</span></a> "Let the Venerable Ānandaexhort me, let him instruct me, let him give me a Dhamma talk in such a way that I might see the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even by this much am I pleased with the Venerable Channa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps the Venerable Channa has opened himself up and broken through his barrenness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lend your ear, friend Channa, you are capable of understanding the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at once a lofty rapture and gladness arose in the Venerable Channa as he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It seems that I am capable of understanding the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Venerable Ānanda then said:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the presence of the Blessed One I have heard this, friend Channa, in his presence I have received the exhortation he spoke to the bhikkhu Kaccānagotta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This world, Kaccāna, for the most part relies upon a duality ... <a id="pt135" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.pali.bd.htm#pg135"><span class="f2">[135]</span></a> <i>(the entire sutta <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.015.bodh.wp.htm">12:15</a> is cited here)</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, friend Ānanda, for those venerable ones who have such compassionate and benevolent brothers in the holy life to admonish and instruct them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now that I have heard this Dhamma teaching of the Venerable Ānanda, I have made the breakthrough to the Dhamma."</p>
