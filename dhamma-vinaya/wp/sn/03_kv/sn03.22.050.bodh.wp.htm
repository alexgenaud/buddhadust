					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to Soṇa the householder's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Soṇa, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand form, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who do not understand feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation: these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones do not, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Soṇa, those ascetics and brahmins who understand form, <a id="pt51" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.050.pali.bd.htm#pg51"><span class="f2">[51]</span></a> its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; who understand feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation: these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life enter and dwell in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood."</p>
