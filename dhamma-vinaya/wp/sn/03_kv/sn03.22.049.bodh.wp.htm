<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Khandha Vagga, Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 49. The Buddha advises Sona that making judgments about the superiority or inferiority or equality of the self with regard to others is just not seeing things as they are and then he leads him through the reasoning involved in seeing shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and sense-consciousness as not self because they are inconstant and that which is inconstant is painful and that so seeing one is free, and seeing freedom in freedom one knows rebirth has been left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing is done and there will be no more being any sort of an 'it' at any place of 'atness'." />

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Soṇa the householder's son approached the Blessed One. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to Soṇa the householder's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Soṇa, when any ascetics and brahmins, on the basis of form — which is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change — regard themselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am superior,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am equal,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am inferior,'</p>

					<p class="f4">what is that due to apart from not seeing things as they really are?</p>

					<p class="f4">"When any ascetics and brahmins, on the basis of feeling ... on the basis of perception ... on the basis of volitional formations ... on the basis of consciousness — which is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change — regard themselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am superior,' or 'I am equal,' or 'I am inferior,' what is that due to apart from not seeing things as they really are?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Soṇa, when any ascetics and brahmins do not, on the basis of form — which is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change — regard themselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am superior,' or 'I am equal,' <a id="pt49" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.049.pali.bd.htm#pg49"><span class="f2">[49]</span></a> or 'I am inferior,' what is that due to apart from seeing things as they really are?</p>

					<p class="f4">"When any ascetics and brahmins do not, on the basis of feeling ... on the basis of perception ... on the basis of volitional formations ... on the basis of consciousness — which is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change — regard themselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am superior,' or 'I am equal,' or 'I am inferior,' what is that due to apart from seeing things as they really are?</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Soṇa, is form permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suffering, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is perception permanent or impermanent? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Are volitional formations permanent or impermanent? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suffering, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Soṇa, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any kind of feeling whatsoever ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Any kind of perception whatsoever ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, <a id="pt50" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.049.pali.bd.htm#pg50"><span class="f2">[50]</span></a> internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, Soṇa, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>
