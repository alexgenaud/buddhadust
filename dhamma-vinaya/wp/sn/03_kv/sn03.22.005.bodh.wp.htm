					<p class="f4">At Sāvatthī. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, develop concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">A bhikkhu who is concentrated understands things as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what does he understand as it really is?</p>

					<p class="f4">The origin and passing away of form; the origin and passing away of feeling; <a id="pt14" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.005.pali.bd.htm#pg14"><span class="f2">[14]</span></a> the origin and passing away of perception; the origin and passing away of volitional formations; the origin and passing away of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of form?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the origin of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the origin of perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the origin of volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the origin of consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, one seeks delight, one welcomes, one remains holding.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is it that one seeks delight in, what does one welcome, to what does one remain holding?</p>

					<p class="f4">One seeks delight in form, welcomes it, and remains holding to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a consequence of this, delight arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delight in form is clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's clinging as condition, existence [comes to be]; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"One seeks delight in feeling ... in perception ... in volitional formations ... in consciousness, welcomes it, and remains holding to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a consequence of this, delight arises. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, bhikkhus, is the origin of form; this is the origin of feeling; this is the origin of perception; this is the origin of volitional formations; this is the origin of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is the passing away of form?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the passing away of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the passing away of perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the passing away of volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the passing away of consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, one does not seek delight, one does not welcome, one does not remain holding.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is it that one does not seek delight in?</p>

					<p class="f4">What doesn't one welcome?</p>

					<p class="f4">To what doesn't one remain holding?</p>

					<p class="f4">One does not seek delight in form, does not welcome it, does not remain holding to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a consequence of this, delight in form ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of delight comes cessation of clinging; with cessation of clinging, cessation of existence. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"One does not seek delight in feeling ... <a id="pt15" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.005.pali.bd.htm#pg15"><span class="f2">[15]</span></a> ... in perception ... in volitional formations ... in consciousness, does not welcome it, does not remain holding to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a consequence of this, delight in consciousness ceases. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, bhikkhus, is the passing away of form; this is the passing away of feeling; this is the passing away of perception; this is the passing away of volitional formations; this is the passing away of consciousness."</p>
