<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Khandha Vagga, Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 97. A bhikkhu asks if there is any shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, or consciousness which is stable and everlasting. He is told that there is not, and then the Buddha explains that if there were one of the stockpiles (khandhas) even as small as a bit of dust that were stable and everlasting there would be no need to teach the Dhamma." />

					<p class="f4">Sitting to one side, that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there, venerable sir, any form that is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and that will remain the same just like eternity itself?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there any feeling ... any perception ... any volitional formations ... any consciousness that is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and that will remain the same just like eternity itself?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhu, there is no form ... no feeling ... no perception ... no volitional formations ... no consciousness that is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and that will remain the same just like eternity itself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One took up a little bit of soil in his fingernail and said to that bhikkhu:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhu, there is not even this much form that is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and that will remain the same just like eternity itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there was this much form that was permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, this living of the holy life for the complete destruction of suffering could not be discerned. But because there is not even this much form that is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, this living of the holy life for the complete destruction of suffering is discerned.</p>
