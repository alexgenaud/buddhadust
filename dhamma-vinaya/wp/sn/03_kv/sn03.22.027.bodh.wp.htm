					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the gratification in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever gratification there is in form — that I discovered.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the gratification in form extends.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the danger in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever danger there is in form — that I discovered.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the danger in form extends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever escape there is from form — that I discovered.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from form extends.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I set out seeking the gratification in ... the danger in ... the escape from feeling ... from perception ... from volitional formations ... from consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever escape there is from consciousness — that I discovered.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have clearly seen with wisdom just how far the escape from consciousness extends.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So long, bhikkhus, as I did not directly know as they really are the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of these five aggregates subject to clinging, I did not claim to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I directly knew all this as it really is, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world with ... its devas and humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The knowledge and vision arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unshakable is my liberation of mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence."</p>
