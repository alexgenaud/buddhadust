<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Khandha Vagga, Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 46. The Buddha explains that whether it is in the past, the future or the present, to view body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness as impermanent, to view that which is impermanent as painful, and to view that which is painful as not the self or an aspect of the self, is seeing things as they are. So seeing, if one turns the heart away from these things and releases the heart by not fueling self through thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence and blindness, the heart becomes steady, happy, untroubled and well and in this freedom, seeing freedom, one knows that rebirth is ended, lived is the godly life, done is duty's doing and there is no more being any sort of an 'it' at any sort of an 'atness'." />

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, form is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Volitional formations are impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When one sees this thus as it really is with correct wisdom, one holds no more views concerning the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one holds no more views concerning the future, one has no more obstinate grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has no more obstinate grasping, the mind becomes dispassionate towards form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness, and is liberated from the taints by nonclinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">"By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, one is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being unagitated, one personally attains Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">One understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>
