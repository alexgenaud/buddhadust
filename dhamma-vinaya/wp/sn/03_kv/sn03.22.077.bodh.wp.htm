					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, form is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself <a id="pt83" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.076.pali.bd.htm#pg83"><span class="f2">[83]</span></a> should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Volitional formations are impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"To whatever extent, bhikkhus, there are abodes of beings, even up to the pinnacle of existence, these are the foremost in the world, these are the best, that is, the arahants."</p>
