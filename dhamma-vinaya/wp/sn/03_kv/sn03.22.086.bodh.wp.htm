					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Anurādha was dwelling in a forest hut not far from the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of wanderers of other sects approached the Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anurādha, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata — the highest type of person, the supreme person, the attainer of the supreme attainment — he describes him in terms of these four cases:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death,' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata — the highest type of person, the supreme person, the attainer of the supreme attainment — he describes him apart from these four cases:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death,' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, those wanderers said to the Venerable Anurādha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This bhikkhu must be newly ordained, not long gone forth; or, if he is an elder, he must be an incompetent fool."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those wanderers of other sects, having denigrated the Venerable Anurādha with the terms "newly ordaine." and "fool," rose from their seats and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt117" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.086.pali.bd.htm#pg117"><span class="f2">[117]</span></a> Then, not long after those wanderers had left, it occurred to the Venerable Anurādha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If those wanderers of other sects should question me further, how should I answer if I am to state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how should I explain in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no reasonable consequence of my assertion would give ground for criticism?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Anurādha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One everything that had happened, <a id="pt118" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.086.pali.bd.htm#pg118"><span class="f2">[118]</span></a> asking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If those wanderers of other sects should question me further, how should I answer ... so that no reasonable consequence of my assertion would give ground for criticism?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, is form permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing thus ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'... there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form as the Tathāgata?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness as the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as in form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the Tathāgata as in feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">As in perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">As in volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">As in consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness [taken together] as the Tathāgata?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as one who is without form, without feeling, without perception, without volitional formations, without consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Anurādha, when the Tathāgata is not apprehended by you as real and actual here in this very life, is it fitting for you to declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata — the highest type of person, the supreme person, the attainer of the supreme attainment — he describes him apart from these four cases:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt119" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.085.pali.bd.htm#pg119"><span class="f2">[119]</span></a> 'The Tathāgata exists after death,' or ...'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Anurādha! Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering."</p>
