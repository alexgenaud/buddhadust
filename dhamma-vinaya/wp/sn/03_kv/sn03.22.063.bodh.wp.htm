					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhu, in clinging one is bound by Māra; by not clinging one is freed from the Evil One."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt74" href="../../../pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.063.pali.bd.htm#pg74"><span class="f2">[74]</span></a> "Understood, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Understood, Fortunate One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In clinging to form, venerable sir, one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to it one is freed from the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">In clinging to feeling ... to perception ... to volitional formations ... to consciousness one is bound by Māra; by not clinging to it one is freed from the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in such a way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, bhikkhu!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief.</p>

					<p class="f4">In clinging to form, bhikkhu, one is bound by Māra... <i>(as above in full)</i> ... by not clinging to it one is freed from the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that bhikkhu, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and, after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, that bhikkhu, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life entered and dwelt in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He directly knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>

					<p class="f4">And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.</p>
