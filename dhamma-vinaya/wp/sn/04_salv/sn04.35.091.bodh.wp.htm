					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata dwells unstirred, with the dart removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu should wish, 'May I dwell unstirred, with the dart removed!' he should not conceive the eye ... forms ... eye-consciousness ... eye-contact ... and as to whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition ... he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, 'That is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For whatever one conceives, bhikkhus, whatever one conceives in, whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as 'mine' — that is otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The world, becoming otherwise, attached to existence, seeks delight only in existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He should not conceive the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He should not conceive the mind ... mental phenomena ... mind-consciousness ... mind-contact ... and as to whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition ... he should not conceive that, should not conceive in that, should not conceive from that, should not conceive, 'That is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For whatever one conceives, bhikkhus, whatever one conceives in, <a id="pt67" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.091.pali.bd.htm#pg67"><span class="f2">[67]</span></a> whatever one conceives from, whatever one conceives as 'mine' — that is otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The world, becoming otherwise, attached to existence, seeks delight only in existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, bhikkhus, is the extent of the aggregates, the elements, and the sense bases, he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, 'That is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging, he is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>
