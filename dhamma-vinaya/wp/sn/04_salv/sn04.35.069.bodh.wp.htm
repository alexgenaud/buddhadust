<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 69. Upasena has been bitten by a snake and wishes to die outdoors. He is taken out and before he dies is questioned by Sāriputta as to why it is that he shows no change in his sense-faculties or countenance. Upasena declares that there is not in him any idea of I-making or mine-making with regard to the senses." />

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a viper had fallen on the Venerable Upasena's body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Upasena addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, friends, lift this body of mine on to the bed and carry it outside before it is scattered right here like a handful of chaff."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Upasena:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We do not see any alteration in the Venerable Upasena's body nor any change in his faculties; yet the Venerable Upasena says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, friends, lift this body of mine on to the bed and carry it outside before it is scattered right here like a handful of chaff."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta for one who thinks, 'I am the eye' or 'The eye is mine'; 'I am the ear' or 'The ear is mine' ...'I am the mind' or 'The mind is mine,' there might be alteration of the body or a change of the faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, friend Sāriputta <a id="pt41" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.069.pali.bd.htm#pg41"><span class="f2">[41]</span></a> it does not occur to me, 'I am the eye' or 'The eye is mine'; 'I am the ear' or 'The ear is mine' ...'I am the mind' or 'The mind is mine,' so why should there be any alteration in my body or any change in my faculties?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It must be because I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Upasena for a long time that it does not occur to him, 'I am the eye' or 'The eye is mine'; 'I am the ear' or 'The ear is mine' ...'I am the mind' or 'The mind is mine."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those bhikkhus lifted the Venerable Upasena's body on to the bed and carried it outside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Upasena's body was scattered right there just like a handful of chaff.</p>
