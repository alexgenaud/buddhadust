					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, all is burning.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, bhikkhus, is the all that is burning?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition — whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant — that too is burning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Burning with what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear is burning ... <a id="pt20" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.028.pali.bd.htm#pg20"><span class="f2">[20]</span></a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is burning ... and whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition — whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant — that too is burning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Burning with what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of delusion; burning with birth, aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact, towards whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition — whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant; experiences revulsion towards the ear ... towards the mind ... towards whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One's statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the thousand bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by nonclinging.</p>
