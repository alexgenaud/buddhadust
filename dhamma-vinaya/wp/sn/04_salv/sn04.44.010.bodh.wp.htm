<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 10. The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks Gotama about whether or not there is a self and receives no reply. When asked by Ānanda for the reason he did not reply he explains that answering in the affirmative he would be stating the eternalists view, answering in the negative he would be stating the annihilationists view, answering in the affirmative he would be answering contrary to his knowledge of all things as changing, answering in the negative poor bewildered Vacchagotta would have been even more bewilded than before." />

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it now, Master Gotama, is there a self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Master Gotama, is there no self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Blessed One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after the wanderer Vacchagotta had left, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is it, venerable sir, that when the Blessed One was questioned by the wanderer Vacchagotta, he did not answer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Ānanda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had answered,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is a self,'</p>

					<p class="f4">this would have been siding with those ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if, when I was asked by him,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there no self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had answered,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no self,'</p>

					<p class="f4">this would have been siding with those ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Ānanda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had answered,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is a self,'</p>

					<p class="f4">would this have been consistent on my part with the arising of the knowledge that 'all phenomena are nonself'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if, when I was asked by him,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there no self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had answered,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no self,'</p>

					<p class="f4">the wanderer Vacchagotta, already confused, would have fallen into even greater confusion, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'It seems that the self I formerly had does not exist now.'"</p>
