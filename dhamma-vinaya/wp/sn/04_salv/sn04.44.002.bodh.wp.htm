					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Anurādha was dwelling in a forest hut not far from the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of wanderers of other sects approached the Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anurādha, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata-the highest type of person, the supreme person, the attainer of the supreme attainment - he describes him in terms of these four cases:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata does not exist after death,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata-the highest type of person, the supreme person, the attainer of the supreme attainment - he describes him apart from these four cases:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata does not exist after death,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, those wanderers said to the Venerable Anurādha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This bhikkhu must be newly ordained, not long gone forth; or, if he is an elder, he must be an incompetent fool."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those wanderers of other sects, having denigrated the Venerable Anurādha with the terms "newly ordained" and "fool," rose from their seats and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after those wanderers had left, it occurred to the Venerable Anurādha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If those wanderers of other sects should question me further, how should I answer if I am to state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how should I explain in accordance with the Dhamma, so that no reasonable consequence of my assertion would give ground for criticism?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Anurādha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One everything that had happened, asking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If those wanderers of other sects should question me further, how should I answer ... so that no reasonable consequence of my assertion would give ground for criticism?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, is form permanent or impermanent?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">... -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing thus ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:'...</p>

					<p class="f4">there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form as the Tathāgata?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir." -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard feeling ...</p>

					<p class="f4">perception ...</p>

					<p class="f4">volitional formations ...</p>

					<p class="f4">consciousness as the Tathāgata?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as in form?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir." -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir." -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the Tathāgata as in feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">As in perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">As in volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from volitional formations?</p>

					<p class="f4">As in consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">As apart from consciousness?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness [taken together] as the Tathāgata?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Anurādha, do you regard the Tathāgata as one who is without form, without feeling, without perception, without volitional formations, without consciousness?" -</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Anurādha, when the Tathāgata is not apprehended by you as real and actual here in this very life, is it fitting for you to declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, when a Tathāgata is describing a Tathāgata - the highest type of person, the supreme person, the attainer of the supreme attainment-he describes him apart from these four cases:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death,' or ... 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, good, Anurādha! Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering."</p>
