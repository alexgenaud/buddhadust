					<p class="f4">Then King Udena approached the Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Bhāradvāja, what is the cause and reason why these young bhikkhus, lads with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, who have not dallied with sensual pleasures, lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, this was said by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhus, towards women old enough to be your mother set up the idea that they are your mother; <a id="pt111" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.127.pali.bd.htm#pg111"><span class="f2">[111]</span></a> towards those of an age to be your sisters set up the idea that they are your sisters; towards those young enough to be your daughters set up the idea that they are your daughters.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a cause and reason, great king, why these young bhikkhus ... lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The mind is wanton, Master Bhāradvāja.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sometimes states of lust arise even towards women old enough to be one's mother; sometimes they arise towards women of an age to be one's sister; sometimes they arise towards women young enough to be one's daughter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there any other cause and reason why these young bhikkhus ... lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, this was said by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhus, review this very body upwards from the soles of the feet, downwards from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as full of many kinds of impurities:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are in this body head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine."'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, great king, is a cause and reason why these young bhikkhus ... lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is easy, Master Bhāradvāja, for those bhikkhus who are developed in body, developed in virtue, developed in mind, developed in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it is difficult for those bhikkhus who are undeveloped in body, undeveloped in virtue, undeveloped in mind, undeveloped in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sometimes, though one thinks, 'I will attend to the body as foul,' one beholds it as beautiful.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt112" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.127.pali.bd.htm#pg112"><span class="f2">[112]</span></a> Is there any other cause and reason why these young bhikkhus ... lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, this was said by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhus, dwell guarding the doors of the sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen a form with the eye, do not grasp its signs and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since, if you leave the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the eye faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having smelt an odour with the nose ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having savoured a taste with the tongue ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having felt a tactile object with the body ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, do not grasp its signs and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since, if you leave the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, great king, is a cause and reason why these young bhikkhus ... lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, Master Bhāradvāja!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is amazing, Master Bhāradvāja!</p>

					<p class="f4">How well this has been stated by the Blessed One who knows and sees, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">So this is the cause and reason why these young bhikkhus, lads with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, who have not dallied with sensual pleasures, lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously.</p>

					<p class="f4">In my case too, when I enter my harem unguarded in body, speech, and mind, without setting up mindfulness, unrestrained in the sense faculties, on that occasion states of lust assail me forcefully.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I enter my harem guarded in body, speech, and mind, <a id="pt113" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.127.pali.bd.htm#pg113"><span class="f2">[113]</span></a> with mindfulness set up, restrained in the sense faculties, on that occasion states of lust do not assail me in such a way.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Bhāradvāja!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent, Master Bhāradvāja!</p>

					<p class="f4">The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Bhāradvāja, as though he were turning upright what had been turned upside down, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Master Bhāradvāja, I go for refuge to the Blessed One, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">From today let Master Bhāradvāja remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."</p>
