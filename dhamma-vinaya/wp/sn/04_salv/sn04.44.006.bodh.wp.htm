The Venerable Sāriputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika other reasons that the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is that these questions do not arise for one who has abandoned delight in body, sense-experience, own-making and consciousness; or for one who has abandoned delight in becoming; or for one who has abandoned delight in thirst. He then aserts that there is no reason more encompassing for not making such asertions than that such do not occur for one who has abandoned thirst." />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What now, friend, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">(i. Delight in the aggregates)</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, it is one who delights in form, who takes delight in form, who rejoices in form, and who does not know and see the cessation of form as it really is, that thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is one who delights in feeling ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who delights in perception ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who delights in volitional formations ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who delights in consciousness, who takes delight in consciousness, who rejoices in consciousness, and who does not know and see the cessation of consciousness as it really is, that thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, one who does not delight in form ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who does not delight in feeling ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who does not delight in perception ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who does not delight in volitional formations ...</p>

					<p class="f4">who does not delight in consciousness, who does not take delight in consciousness, who does not rejoice in consciousness, and who knows and sees the cessation of consciousness as it really is, does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii. Delight in existence)</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, could there be another method of explaining why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There could be, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is one who delights in existence, who takes delight in existence, who rejoices in existence, and who does not know and see the cessation of existence as it really is, that thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, one who does not delight in existence, who does not take delight in existence, who does not rejoice in existence, and who knows and sees the cessation of existence as it really is, does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii. Delight in clinging)</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, could there be another method of explaining why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There could be, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is one who delights in clinging, who takes delight in clinging, who rejoices in clinging, and who does not know and see the cessation of clinging as it really is, that thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, one who does not delight in clinging, who does not take delight in clinging, who does not rejoice in clinging, and who knows and sees the cessation of clinging as it really is, does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv. Delight in craving)</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, could there be another method of explaining why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There could be, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is one who delights in craving, who takes delight in craving, who rejoices in craving, and who does not know and see the cessation of craving as it really is, that thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, one who does not delight in craving, who does not take delight in craving, who does not rejoice in craving, and who knows and sees the cessation of craving as it really is, does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">(v. Another method?)</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, could there be another method of explaining why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here now, friend Sāriputta, why should you want anything additional to this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of craving, there is no round for describing him."</p>
