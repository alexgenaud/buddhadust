					<p class="f4">If one dwells without restraint over the eye faculty, the mind is soiled among forms cognizable by the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the mind is soiled, there is no gladness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is no gladness, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is no rapture, there is no tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is no tranquillity, one dwells in suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of one who suffers does not become concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is not concentrated, phenomena do not become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because phenomena do not become manifest, one is reckoned as 'one who dwells negligently.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Because phenomena do not become manifest, one is reckoned as 'one who dwells negligently.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that one dwells negligently.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one is gladdened, rapture is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uplifted by rapture, the body becomes tranquil.</p>

					<p class="f4">One tranquil in body experiences happiness.</p>
