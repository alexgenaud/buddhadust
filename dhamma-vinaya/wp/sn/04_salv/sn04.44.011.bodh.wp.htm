<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 11. The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks the Venerable Sabhiya a series of questions about existence and non-existence of one who has attained the goal and is told in all cases that these are not questions on which the Buddha has made a declarative statement. When asked why this is so, the Venerable Sabhiya asks in return how one would describe someone if there were no grounds for saying that a thing existed." />

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Venerable Sabhiya Kaccāna and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, Master Kaccāna, does the Tathāgata exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">(/All as in <a href="sn04.44.001.bodh.wp.htm">§1</a> down to:/)</p>

					<p class="f4">"How long has it been since you went forth, Master Kaccāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not long, friend. Three years."</p>

					<p class="f4">"One, friend, who has gotten so much in such a time has indeed gotten much, not to speak of one who has surpassed this!"</p>
