					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saw a great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges, and he addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you see, bhikkhus, that great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, bhikkhus, that log does not veer towards the near shore, does not veer towards the far shore, does not sink in mid-stream, does not get cast up on high ground, does not get caught by human beings, does not get caught by nonhuman beings, does not get caught in a whirlpool, and does not become inwardly rotten, it will slant, slope, and incline towards the ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the current of the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, if you do not veer towards the near shore, do not veer towards the far shore, do not sink in mid-stream, do not get cast up on high ground, do not get caught by human beings, do not get caught by nonhuman beings, do not get caught in a whirlpool, and do not become inwardly rotten, <a id="pt180" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.200.pali.bd.htm#pg180"><span class="f2">[180]</span></a> you will slant, slope, and incline towards Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because right view slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, venerable sir, is the near shore?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the far shore?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is sinking in mid-stream?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is getting cast up on high ground?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is getting caught by human beings, what is getting caught by nonhuman beings, what is getting caught in a whirlpool?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is inward rottenness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'The near shore,' bhikkhu: this is a designation for the six internal sense bases.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The far shore': this is a designation for the six external sense bases.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sinking in mid-stream': this is a designation for delight and lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Getting cast up on high ground': this is a designation for the conceit 'I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhu, is getting caught by human beings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone lives in association with laypeople; he rejoices with them and sorrows with them, he is happy when they are happy and sad when they are sad, and he involves himself in their affairs and duties.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called getting caught by human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhu, is getting caught by nonhuman beings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone lives the holy life with the aspiration [to be reborn] into a certain order of devas, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By this virtue or vow or austerity or holy life I will become a deva or one among the devas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called getting caught by nonhuman beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Getting caught in a whirlpool': this, bhikkhu, is a designation for the five cords of sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhu, is inward rottenness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here someone is immoral, one of evil character, of impure and suspect behaviour, secretive in his acts, no ascetic though claiming to be one, <a id="pt181" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.200.pali.bd.htm#pg181"><span class="f2">[181]</span></a> not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called inward rottenness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the cowherd Nanda was standing near the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, I will not veer towards the near shore, I will not veer towards the far shore, I will not sink in mid-stream, I will not get cast up on high ground, I will not get caught by human beings, I will not get caught by nonhuman beings, I will not get caught in a whirlpool, I will not become inwardly rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I receive the going forth under the Blessed One, may I receive the higher ordination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Nanda, return the cows to their owners."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The cows will go back of their own accord, venerable sir, out of attachment to the calves."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Return the cows to their owners, Nanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the cowherd Nanda returned the cows to their owners, came back to the Blessed One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The cows have been returned to their owners, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I receive the going forth under the Blessed One, may I receive the higher ordination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the cowherd Nanda received the going forth under the Blessed One, and he received the higher ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">And soon, not long after his higher ordination, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute ... the Venerable Nanda became one of the arahants."</p>
