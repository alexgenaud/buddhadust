					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu dwells thus, mindful and clearly comprehending, diligent, ardent, and resolute, if there arises in him a pleasant feeling, he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There has arisen in me a pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that is dependent, not independent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on just this contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this contact is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">So when the pleasant feeling has arisen in dependence on a contact that is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, how could it be permanent?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells contemplating impermanence in contact and in pleasant feeling, he dwells contemplating vanishing, contemplating fading away, contemplating cessation, contemplating relinquishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he dwells thus, the underlying tendency to lust in regard to contact and in regard to pleasant feeling is abandoned by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu dwells thus, mindful and clearly comprehending, diligent, ardent, and resolute, if there arises in him a painful feeling, he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There has arisen in me a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that is dependent, not independent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on just this contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he dwells thus, the underlying tendency to aversion in regard to contact and in regard to painful feeling is abandoned by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu dwells thus, mindful and clearly comprehending, diligent, ardent, and resolute, if there arises in him a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There has arisen in me a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that is dependent, not independent.</p>
