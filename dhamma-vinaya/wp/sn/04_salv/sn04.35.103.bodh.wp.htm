					<p class="f4">When, having understood as they really are the origin, the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact, a bhikkhu is liberated by nonclinging, such a bhikkhu is a universal conqueror.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The tumour,' bhikkhus: this is a designation for this body consisting of the four great elements, originating from mother and father, built up out of rice and gruel, subject to impermanence, to rubbing and pressing, to breaking apart and dispersal.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The tumour's root': this is a designation for craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving has been abandoned by a bhikkhu, cut off at the root, <a id="pt84" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.103.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><span class="f2">[84]</span></a> made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising, in such a case the bhikkhu has excised the tumour's root not excised before.</p>
