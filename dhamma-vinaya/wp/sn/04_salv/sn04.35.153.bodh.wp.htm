					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is a method of exposition by means of which a bhikkhu — apart from faith ... apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it — can declare final knowledge thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth ... there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that method of exposition?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, having seen a form with the eye, if there is lust, hatred, or delusion internally, a bhikkhu understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is lust, hatred, or delusion internally';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, if there is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is so, are these things to be understood by faith, or by personal preference, or by oral tradition, or by reasoned reflection, or by acceptance of a view after pondering it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Aren't these things to be understood by seeing them with wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, bhikkhus, is the method of exposition by means of which a bhikkhu can declare final knowledge thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth ... there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, bhikkhus, having heard a sound with the ear ... <a id="pt140" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.152.pali.bd.htm#pg140"><span class="f2">[140]</span></a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, if there is lust, hatred, or delusion internally, a bhikkhu understands:</p>
