					paid homage to him,<br />
					sat down to one side,<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, what now is feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the origin of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way leading to the origination of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cessation of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way leading to the cessation of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the gratification in feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the danger?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the escape?"</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, bhikkhu, these three feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the arising of contact there is the arising of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the way leading to the origination of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of contact there is the cessation of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of feeling; that is, right view ... right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feeling: this is the gratification in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">That feeling is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change: this is the danger in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">The removal and abandonment of desire and lust for feeling: this is the escape from feeling."</p>
