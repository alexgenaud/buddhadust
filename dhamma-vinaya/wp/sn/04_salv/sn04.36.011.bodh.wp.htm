					<p class="f4">Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Three feeling have been spoken of by the Blessed One:<br />
					pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These three feelings have been spoken of by the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Blessed One has said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever is felt is included in suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now with reference to what was this stated by the Blessed One?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, bhikkhu!</p>

					<p class="f4">These three feelings have been spoken of by me:<br />
					pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These three feelings have been spoken of by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I have also said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever is felt is included in suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That has been stated by me with reference to the impermanence of formations.</p>

					<p class="f4">That has been stated by me with reference to formations being subject to destruction ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to formations being subject to vanishing ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to formations being subject to fading away ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to formations being subject to cessation ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to formations being subject to change.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, bhikkhu, I have also taught the successive cessation of formations.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the first jhāna sa eech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the second jhāna hought and examination have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the third jhāna rapture has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the fourth jhāna in-breathing and out-breathing have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the base of the infinity of space, the perception of form has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the base of the infinity of consciousness, the perception pertaining to the base of the infinity of space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the base of nothingness, the perception pertaining to the base of the infinity of consciousness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, the perception pertaining to the base of nothingness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, lust has ceased, hatred has ceased, delusion has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, bhikkhu, I have also taught the successive subsiding of formations.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the first jhāna speech has subsided....</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, lust has subsided, hatred has subsided, delusion has subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, bhikkhu, these six kinds of tranquillization.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the first jhāna speech has been tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the second jhān, ought and examination have been tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the third jhāna rapture has been tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the fourth jhāna in-breathing and out-breathing have been tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, lust has been tranquillized, hatred has been tranquillized, delusion has been tranquillized."</p>
