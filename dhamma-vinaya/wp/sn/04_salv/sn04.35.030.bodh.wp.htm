					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not conceive the eye, does not conceive in the eye, does not conceive from the eye, does not conceive, 'The eye is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not conceive forms ... eye-consciousness ... eye-contact ... and as to whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition — whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant — he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, 'That is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not conceive the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not conceive the mind ... mental phenomena ... mind-consciousness ... mind-contact ... <a id="pt23" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.030.pali.bd.htm#pg23"><span class="f2">[23]</span></a> and as to whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition ... he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, 'That is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does not conceive all, does not conceive in all, does not conceive from all, does not conceive, 'All is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging, he is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being unagitated, he personally attains  Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, bhikkhus, is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings."</p>
