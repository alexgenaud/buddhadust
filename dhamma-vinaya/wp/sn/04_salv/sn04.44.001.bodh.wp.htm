					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the bhikkhunīKhemā, while wandering on tour among the Kosalans, had taken up residence in Toraṇavatthu between Sāvatthī and Sāketa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, while travelling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, took up residence for one night in Toraṇavatthu between Sāketa and Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a man thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, good man, and find out whether there is any ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom I could visit today."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire,"</p>

					<p class="f4">the man replied, but though he traversed the whole of Toraṇavatthu he did not see any ascetic or brahmin there whom King Pasenadi could visit.</p>

					<p class="f4">The man did see, however, the bhikkhunī Khemā resident in Toraṇavatthu, so he approached King Pasenadi and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, there is no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom your majesty could visit.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, sire, there is the bhikkhunī named Khemā, disciple of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a good report concerning this revered lady has spread about thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'She is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, a splendid speaker, ingenious.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Let your majesty visit her."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the bhikkhunī Khemā, paid homage to her, sat down to one side, and said to her:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, revered lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this either:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this either:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is this, revered lady?</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked,</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it, revered lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">And when asked,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?' —</p>

					<p class="f4">in each case you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What now, revered lady, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, great king?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the river Ganges thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many grains of sand,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many hundreds of grains of sand,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many thousands of grains of sand,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sand'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered lady."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, great king, do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the water in the great ocean thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many thousands of gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered lady.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the great ocean is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, great king, that form by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of form; he is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata does not exist after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' does not apply.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That feeling by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That perception by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Those volitional formations by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him ...</p>

					<p class="f4">That consciousness by which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness; he is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata does not exist after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' does not apply."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhunīKhemā's statement, rose from his seat, paid homage to her, and departed, keeping her on his right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on a later occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, venerable sir, does the Tathāgata exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, I have not declared this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">(/All as above down to:/)</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, I have not declared this either:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is this, venerable sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked,</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it, venerable sir, does the Tathāgata exist after death?' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">And when asked,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, venerable sir, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?' —</p>

					<p class="f4">in each case you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Great king, I have not declared this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What now, venerable sir, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, great king?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(/all as above down to/:)</p>

					<p class="f4">... The Tathāgata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness: he is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata does not exist after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' does not apply;</p>

					<p class="f4">'the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' does not apply."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is amazing, venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">How the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge, that is, in regard to the chief matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion, venerable sir, I approached the bhikkhunī Khemā, and asked her about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">The revered lady explained this matter to me in exactly the same terms and phrases that the Blessed One used.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is amazing, venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">How the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge, that is, in regard to the chief matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, venerable sir, we must go.</p>

					<p class="f4">We are busy and have much to do."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, great king, you may go at your own convenience."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's statement, rose from his seat, paid homage to him, and departed, keeping him on his right.</p>
