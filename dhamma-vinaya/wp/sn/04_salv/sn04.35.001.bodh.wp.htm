The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are inconstant, painful and not self and that seeing that brings freedom and recognizing that freedom as freedom rebirth is left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing has been done and there is no more being any sort of an it at any place of atness left for one." />

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir." those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is impermanent. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering is nonself.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nonself should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt2" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.001.pali.bd.htm#pg2"><span class="f2">[2]</span></a> "Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, revulsion towards the ear, revulsion towards the nose, revulsion towards the tongue, revulsion towards the body, revulsion towards the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>
