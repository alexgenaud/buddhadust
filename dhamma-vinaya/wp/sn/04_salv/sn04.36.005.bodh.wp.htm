					<p class="f4">Pleasant feeling, bhikkhus, should be seen as painful; painful feeling should be seen as a dart; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling should be seen as impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has seen pleasant feeling as painful, painful feeling as a dart, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling as impermanent, he is called a bhikkhu who sees rightly.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has cut off craving, severed the fetters, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end to suffering."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">One who has seen the pleasant as painful<br />
							And the painful as a dart,<br />
							Seen as impermanent the peaceful feeling<br />
							Neither painful nor pleasant:<br />
							He is a bhikkhu who sees rightly,<br />
							One who fully understands feelings.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Having fully understood feelings,<br />
							He is taintless in this very life.<br />
							Standing in Dhamma, with the body's breakup<br />
							The knowledge-master cannot be reckoned.</p>
