					<p class="f4">Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The states that ripen in liberation have come to maturity in Rāhula.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me lead him on further to the destruction of the taints."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, walked for alms in Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had returned from the alms round, after his meal he addressed the Venerable Rāhula thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Take a sitting cloth, Rāhula.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go to the Blind Men's Grove for the day's abiding."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," the Venerable Rāhula replied and, having taken a sitting cloth, he followed close behind the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion many thousands of devatās followed the Blessed One, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today the Blessed One will lead the Venerable Rāhula on further to the destruction of the taints."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One plunged into the Blind Men's Grove and sat down at the foot of a certain tree on a seat that was prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Rāhula paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt106" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.121.pali.bd.htm#pg106"><span class="f2">[106]</span></a> The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Rāhula, is the eye permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suffering, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are forms permanent or impermanent? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is eye-consciousness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is eye-contact ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is anything included in feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness arisen with eye-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(The rest as in the preceding paragraph.)</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Is the ear ... the mind permanent or impermanent?... <a id="pt107" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.121.pali.bd.htm#pg107"><span class="f2">[107]</span></a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Are mental phenomena ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is mind-consciousness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is mind-contact ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is anything included in feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness arisen with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suffering, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, Rāhula, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, revulsion towards forms, revulsion towards eye-consciousness, revulsion towards eye-contact; revulsion towards anything included in feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness arisen with eye-contact as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">He experiences revulsion towards the ear ... towards the mind ... towards anything included in feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness arisen with mind-contact as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Elated, the Venerable Rāhula delighted in the Blessed One's statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while this discourse was being spoken, the Venerable Rāhula's mind was liberated from the taints by nonclinging, and in those many thousands of devatās there arose the dust-free, stainless vision of the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."</p>
