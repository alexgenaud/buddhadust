					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In recent days, Master Gotama, a number of ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers of various sects had assembled in the debating hall and were sitting together when this conversation arose among them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Pūraṇa Kassapa — the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many people — declares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">And in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who had attained the supreme attainment, when that disciple has passed away and died he also declares his rebirth thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">his Makkhali Gosāla ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Nigaṇṭho Nātaputto ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Sañjayo Bellaṭṭhiputto ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Pakudho Kaccāyano ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Ajito Kesakambalo ...</p>

					<p class="f4">when that disciple has passed away [399] and died he also declares his rebirth thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">This ascetic Gotama — the leader of an order, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, the well known and famous spiritual guide considered holy by many people — declares the rebirth of a disciple who has passed away and died thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">But in the case of a disciple who was a person of the highest kind, a supreme person, one who had attained the supreme attainment, when that disciple has passed away and died he does not declare his rebirth thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one was reborn there, that one was reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">Rather, he declares of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He cut off craving, severed the fetter, and, by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end to suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There was perplexity in me, Master Gotama, there was doubt:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is the Dhamma of the ascetic Gotama to be understood?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Vaccha, it is fitting for you to doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare, Vaccha, rebirth for one with fuel, not for one without fuel.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a fire burns with fuel, but not without fuel, so, Vaccha, I declare rebirth for one with fuel, not for one without fuel."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, when a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance, what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, Vaccha, a flame is flung by the wind and goes some distance, I declare that it is fuelled by the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">For on that occasion the wind is its fuel."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And, Master Gotama, when a being has laid down this body but has not yet been reborn in another body, what does Master Gotama declare to be its fuel on that occasion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, Vaccha, a being has laid down this body but has not yet been reborn in another body, I declare that it is fuelled by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">For on that occasion craving is its fuel."</p>
