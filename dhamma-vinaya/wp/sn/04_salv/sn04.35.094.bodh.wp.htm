					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, these six bases for contact — if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained — are bringers of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, bhikkhus, as a base for contact — if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained — is a bringer of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear as a base for contact ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind as a base for contact ... is a bringer of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">These six bases for contact — if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained — are bringers of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, these six bases for contact — if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained — are bringers of happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, bhikkhus, as a base for contact — if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained — is a bringer of happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear as a base for contact ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind as a base for contact ... is a bringer of happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">These six bases for contact — if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained — are bringers of happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Just six, O bhikkhus, are the bases for contact,<br />
							Where one unrestrained meets with suffering.<br />
							Those who know how to restrain them<br />
							Dwell uncorrupted, with faith their partner.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Having seen forms that delight the mind<br />
							And having seen those that give no delight,<br />
							Dispel the path of lust towards the delightful<br />
							And do not soil the mind by thinking,<br />
							'[The other] is displeasing to me.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt71" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.094.pali.bd.htm#pg71"><span class="f2">[71]</span></a> "Having heard sounds both pleasant and raucous,<br />
							Do not be enthralled with pleasant sound.<br />
							Dispel the course of hate towards the raucous,<br />
							And do not soil the mind by thinking,<br />
							'[This one] is displeasing to me.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Having smelt a fragrant, delightful scent,<br />
							And having smelt a putrid stench,<br />
							Dispel aversion towards the stench<br />
							And do not yield to desire for the lovely.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Having enjoyed a sweet delicious taste,<br />
							And having sometimes tasted what is bitter,<br />
							Do not greedily enjoy the sweet taste,<br />
							Do not feel aversion towards the bitter.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When touched by pleasant contact do not be enthralled,<br />
							Do not tremble when touched by pain.<br />
							Look evenly on both the pleasant and painful,<br />
							Not drawn or repelled by anything.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When common people of proliferated perception<br />
							Perceive and proliferate they become engaged.<br />
							Having dispelled every mind-state bound to the home life,<br />
							One travels on the road of renunciation.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When the mind is thus well developed in six,<br />
							If touched, one's mind never flutters anywhere.<br />
							Having vanquished both lust and hate, O bhikkhus,<br />
							Go to the far shore beyond birth and death."</p>
