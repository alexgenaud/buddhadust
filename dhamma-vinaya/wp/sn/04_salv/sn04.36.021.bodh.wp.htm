					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Moliya-Sīvaka approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever a person experiences,<br />
					whether it be pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,<br />
					all that is caused by what was done in the past.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What does Master Gotama say about this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Some feelings, Sīvaka arise here originating from bile disorders:<br />
					that some feelings arise here originating from bile disorders<br />
					one can know for oneself,<br />
					and that is considered to be true in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when those ascetics and brahmins<br />
					hold such a doctrine and view as this,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever a person experiences,<br />
					whether it be pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, all that is caused by what was done in the past,'</p>

					<p class="f4">they overshoot what one knows by oneself and they overshoot what is considered to be true in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore I say that this is wrong on the part of those ascetics and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Some feelings, Sīvaka arise here originating from phlegm disorders ...</p>

					<p class="f4">originating from wind disorders ...</p>

					<p class="f4">originating from an imbalance [of the three] ... produced by change of climate ...</p>

					<p class="f4">produced by careless behaviour ...</p>

					<p class="f4">caused by assault ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Some feelings, Sīvaka arise here produced as the result of kamma: how some feelings arise here produced as the result of kamma one can know for oneself, and that is considered to be true in the world.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when those ascetics and brahmins hold such a doctrine and view as this,|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever a person experiences, whether it be pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, all that is caused by what was done in the past,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore I say that this is wrong on the part of those ascetics and brahmins."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the wanderer Moliya-Sīvaka said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent, Master Gotama! ...</p>

					<p class="f4">From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Bile, phlegm, and also wind,<br />
							Imbalance and climate too,<br />
							Carelessness and assault,<br />
							With kamma result as the eighth."</p>
