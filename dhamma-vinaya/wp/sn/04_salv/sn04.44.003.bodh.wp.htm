The Venerable Sāriputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika that the reason the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is because any such assertion would limit such a one to existence relative to form, sense experience, perception, own-making and consciousness and that such a one cannot be described by such limited ideas." />
