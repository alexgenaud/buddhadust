					<p class="f4">But that is not the ocean in the Noble One's Discipline; that is only a great mass of water, a great expanse of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person; its current consists of forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who withstands that current consisting of forms is said to have crossed the ocean of the eye with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is the ocean for a person; its current consists of mental phenomena.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who withstands that current consisting of mental phenomena is said to have crossed the ocean of the mind with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"One who has crossed this ocean so hard to cross,<br />
							With its dangers of sharks, demons, waves,<br />
							The knowledge-master who has lived the holy life,<br />
							Reached the world's end, is called one gone beyond."</p>
