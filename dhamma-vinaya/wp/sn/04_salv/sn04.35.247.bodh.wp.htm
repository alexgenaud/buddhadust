					<p class="f4">Thus that man would thereby experience even more pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu here, gone to the village or the forest, meets someone who reproaches him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one, acting in such a way, behaving in such a way, is a foul village thorn.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having understood him thus as a 'thorn,' one should understand restraint and nonrestraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, bhikkhus is there nonrestraint?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is intent upon a pleasing form and repelled by a displeasing form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells without having set up mindfulness of the body, with a limited mind, and he does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is intent upon a pleasing mental phenomenon and repelled by a displeasing mental phenomenon.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells without having set up mindfulness of the body, with a limited mind, and he does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, a man would catch six animals — with different domains and different feeding grounds — and tie them by a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would catch a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, <a id="pt199" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.206.pali.bd.htm#pg199"><span class="f2">[199</span></a> a jackal, and a monkey, and tie each by a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so, he would tie the ropes together with a knot in the middle and release them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those six animals with different domains and different feeding grounds would each pull in the direction of its own feeding ground and domain.</p>

					<p class="f4">The snake would pull one way, thinking, 'Let me enter an anthill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The crocodile would pull another way, thinking, 'Let me enter the water.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The bird would pull another way, thinking, 'Let me fly up into the sky.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The dog would pull another way, thinking, 'Let me enter a village.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The jackal would pull another way, thinking, 'Let me enter a charnel ground.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The monkey would pull another way, thinking, 'Let me enter a forest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now when these six animals become worn out and fatigued, they would be dominated by the one among them that was strongest; they would submit to it and come under its control.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has not developed and cultivated mindfulness directed to the body, the eye pulls in the direction of agreeable forms and disagreeable forms are repulsive; the ear pulls in the direction of agreeable sounds and disagreeable sounds are repulsive; the nose pulls in the direction of agreeable odours and disagreeable odours are repulsive; the tongue pulls in the direction of agreeable tastes and disagreeable tastes are repulsive; the body pulls in the direction of agreeable tactile objects and disagreeable tactile objects are repulsive; the mind pulls in the direction of agreeable mental phenomena and disagreeable mental phenomena are repulsive.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in such a way that there is nonrestraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, bhikkhus, is there restraint?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is not intent upon a pleasing form and not repelled by a displeasing form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells having set up mindfulness of the body, with a measureless mind, and he understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is not intent upon a pleasing mental phenomenon and not repelled by a displeasing mental phenomenon.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way that there is restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, a man would catch six animals — with different domains and different feeding grounds — and tie them by a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would catch a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey, and tie each by a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so, he would bind them to a strong post or pillar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those six animals with different domains and different feeding grounds would each pull in the direction of its own feeding ground and domain.</p>

					<p class="f4">The snake would pull one way, thinking, 'Let me enter an anthill' ... <i>(as above)</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The monkey would pull another way, thinking, 'Let me enter a forest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now when these six animals become worn out and fatigued, they would stand close to that post or pillar, they would sit down there, they would lie down there.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has developed and cultivated mindfulness directed to the body, the eye does not pull in the direction of agreeable forms nor are disagreeable forms repulsive; the ear does not pull in the direction of agreeable sounds nor are disagreeable sounds repulsive; the nose does not pull in the direction of agreeable odours nor are disagreeable odours repulsive; the tongue does not pull in the direction of agreeable tastes nor are disagreeable tastes repulsive; the body does not pull in the direction of agreeable tactile objects nor are disagreeable tactile objects repulsive; the mind does not pull in the direction of agreeable mental phenomena nor are disagreeable mental phenomena repulsive.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in such a way that there is restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'A strong post or pillar': this, bhikkhus, is a designation for mindfulness directed to the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will develop and cultivate mindfulness directed to the body, make it our vehicle, make it our basis, stabilize it, exercise ourselves in it, and fully perfect it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourselves."</p>
