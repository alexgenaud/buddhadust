					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.wood.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> On one occasion the Venerable Mahā Kaccāna was dwelling among the people of Avantī in a forest hut at Makkarakaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt117" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.pali.bd.htm#pg117"><span class="f2">[117]</span></a> Then a number of brahmin youths, students of the brahmin Lohicca, while collecting firewood, approached the Venerable Mahā Kaccāna's forest hut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached, they stomped and trampled all around the hut, and in a boisterous and noisy manner they played various pranks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These shaveling ascetics, menials, swarthy offspring of the Lord's feet, are honoured, respected, esteemed, worshipped, and venerated by their servile devotees."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Mahā Kaccāna came out of his dwelling and said to those brahmin youths:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Don't make any noise, boys.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak to you on the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, those youths became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable  Mahā Kaccāna addressed those youths with verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Those men of old who excelled in virtue,<br />
							Those brahmins who recalled the ancient rules,<br />
							Their sense doors guarded, well protected,<br />
							Dwelt having vanquished wrath within.<br />
							They took delight in Dhamma and meditation,<br />
							Those brahmins who recalled the ancient rules.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"But these have fallen, claiming 'We recite.'<br />
							Puffed up by clan, faring unrighteously,<br />
							Overcome by anger, armed with diverse weapons,<br />
							They molest both frail and firm.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"For one with sense doors unguarded<br />
							[All the vows he undertakes] are vain<br />
							Just like the wealth a man gains in a dream: <a id="pt118" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.pali.bd.htm#pg118"><span class="f2">[118]</span></a><br />
							Fasting and sleeping on the ground,<br />
							Bathing at dawn, [study of] the three Vedas,<br />
							Rough hides, matted locks, and dirt;<br />
							Hymns, rules and vows, austerities,<br />
							Hypocrisy, bent staffs, ablutions:<br />
							These emblems of the brahmins<br />
							Are used to increase their worldly gains.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"A mind that is well concentrated,<br />
							Clear and free from blemish,<br />
							Tender towards all sentient beings —<br />
							That is the path for attaining Brahmā."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brahmin youths, angry and displeased, approached the brahmin Lohicca and told him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"See now, sir, you should know that the ascetic Mahā Kaccāna categorically denigrates and scorns the hymns of the brahmins."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the brahmin Lohicca was angry and displeased.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not proper for me to abuse and revile the ascetic  Mahā Kaccāna solely on the basis of what I have heard from these youths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me approach him and inquire."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Lohicca, together with those brahmin youths, approached the Venerable Mahā Kaccāna.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt119" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.pali.bd.htm#pg119"><span class="f2">[119]</span></a> He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Mahā Kaccāna and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Kaccāna, did a number of brahmin youths, my students, come this way while collecting firewood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They did, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Did Master Kaccāna have any conversation with them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I did have a conversation with them, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What kind of conversation did you have with them, Master Kaccāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The conversation I had with those youths was like this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"'Those men of old who excelled in virtue,<br />
							Those brahmins who recalled the ancient rules, ...<br />
							Tender towards all sentient beings —<br />
							That is the path for attaining Brahmā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such was the conversation that I had with those youths."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Kaccāna said 'with sense doors unguarded.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In what way, Master Kaccāna, is one 'with sense doors unguarded'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, brahmin, having seen a form with the eye, someone is intent upon a pleasing form and repelled by a displeasing form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells without having set up mindfulness of the body, with a limited mind, <a id="pt120" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.pali.bd.htm#pg120"><span class="f2">[120]</span></a> and he does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, someone is intent upon a pleasing mental phenomenon and repelled by a displeasing mental phenomenon.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells without having set up mindfulness of the body ... cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way, brahmin, that one is 'with sense doors unguarded."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, Master Kaccāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is amazing, Master Kaccāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">How Master Kaccāna has declared one whose sense doors are actually unguarded to be one 'with sense doors unguarded'!</p>

					<p class="f4">But Master Kaccāna said 'with sense doors guarded.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In what way, Master Kaccāna, is one 'with sense doors guarded'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, brahmin, having seen a form with the eye, someone is not intent upon a pleasing form and not repelled by a displeasing form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells having set up mindfulness of the body, with a measureless mind, and he understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, someone is not intent upon a pleasing mental phenomenon and not repelled by a displeasing mental phenomenon.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells having set up mindfulness of the body ... cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way, brahmin, that one is 'with sense doors guarded."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, Master Kaccāna! It is amazing, Master Kaccāna!</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt121" href="../../../pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.132.pali.bd.htm#pg121"><span class="f2">[121]</span></a> How Master Kaccāna has declared one whose sense doors are actually guarded to be one 'with sense doors guarded'!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent, Master Kaccāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent, Master Kaccāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Kaccāna ... <i>(as in <a href="sn04.35.127.bodh.wp.htm">§127</a>)</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">From today let Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let Master Kaccāna approach the Lohicca family just as he approaches the families of the lay followers in Makkarakaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahmin youths and maidens there will pay homage to Master Kaccāna, they will stand up for him out of respect, they will offer him a seat and water, and that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."</p>
