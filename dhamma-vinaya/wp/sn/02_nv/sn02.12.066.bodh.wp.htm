					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus, where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you engage in inward exploration, bhikkhus?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, one bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, I engage in inward exploration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How do you engage in inward exploration, bhikkhu?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The bhikkhu then explained but the way he explained did not satisfy the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Ānandasaid:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time for this, Fortunate One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One explain inward exploration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen and attend closely, Ānanda, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, when engaged in inward exploration, a bhikkhu explores thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world [headed by] aging-and-death: what is the source of this suffering, what is its origin, <a id="pt108" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.066.pali.bd.htm#pg108"><span class="f2">[108]</span></a> from what is it born and produced?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists does aging-and-death come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what does not exist does aging-and-death not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he explores he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world [headed by] aging-and-death: this suffering has acquisition as its source, acquisition as its origin; it is born and produced from acquisition.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is acquisition, aging-and-death comes to be; when there is no acquisition, aging-and-death does not come to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practises in that way and conducts himself accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of aging-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the source of this acquisition, what is its origin, from what is it born and produced?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists does acquisition come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what is absent does acquisition not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he explores he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Acquisition has craving as its source, craving as its origin; it is born and produced from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is craving, acquisition comes to be; when there is no craving, acquisition does not come to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He understands acquisition, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practises in that way and conducts himself accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of acquisition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When this craving arises, where does it arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">When it settles down, upon what does it settle?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he explores he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature: it is here that this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye has a pleasant and agreeable nature in the world: it is here that this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too the ear, <a id="pt109" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.066.pali.bd.htm#pg109"><span class="f2">[109]</span></a> the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind have a pleasant and agreeable nature: it is here that this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past regarded that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they nurtured craving. In nurturing craving they nurtured acquisition.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing acquisition they nurtured suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing suffering they were not freed from birth, aging, and death; they were not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they were not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they will nurture craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing craving they will nurture acquisition.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing acquisition they will nurture suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing suffering they will not be freed from birth, aging, and death; they will not be freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they will not be freed from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing craving they are nurturing acquisition.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing acquisition they are nurturing suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">In nurturing suffering they are not freed from birth, aging, and death; they are not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt110" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.066.pali.bd.htm#pg110"><span class="f2">[110]</span></a> "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a bronze cup of a beverage having a fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it was mixed with poison.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat, tired, parched, and thirsty.</p>

					<p class="f4">They would tell him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good man, this beverage in the bronze cup has a fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it is mixed with poison.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drink it if you wish.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you drink it, it will gratify you with its colour, aroma, and taste, but by drinking it you will meet death or deadly suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Suddenly, without reflecting, he would drink the beverage — he would not reject it — and thereby he would meet death or deadly suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past ... in the future ... at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving. In nurturing craving ... they are not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past regarded that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they abandoned craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">In abandoning craving they abandoned acquisition. In abandoning acquisition they abandoned suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">In abandoning suffering they were freed from birth, aging, and death; they were freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they were freed from suffering, I say. "Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future <a id="pt111" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.066.pali.bd.htm#pg111"><span class="f2">[111]</span></a> will regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they will abandon craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the man would think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I can quench my thirst with water, whey, porridge, or soup, but I should not drink that beverage, since to do so would lead to my harm and suffering for a long time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having reflected, he would not drink the beverage but would reject it, <a id="pt112" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.066.pali.bd.htm#pg112"><span class="f2">[112]</span></a> and thereby he would not meet death or deadly suffering.</p>
