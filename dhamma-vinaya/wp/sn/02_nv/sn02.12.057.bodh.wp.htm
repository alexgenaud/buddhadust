					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a sapling, and from time to time a man would clear the area around the roots, from time to time provide it with good soil, from time to time water it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sustained by that care, nourished by it, that sapling would attain to growth, increase, and expansion.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, craving increases. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of craving comes cessation of clinging. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that sapling would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>
