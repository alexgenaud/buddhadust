<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 4. Kalarakhattiyo Vagga), Sutta 35. In response to a series of questions concerning 'who' experiences the various stages of the paṭicca samuppāda, The Buddha explains that these questions assume the idea of an individual or experiencer, and a differentiation between the experience and the experiencer and that such an assumption falls into the trap of postulating an eternal self or a self that is annihilated and that with either of those two extreme views it is not possible to end pain and reach the goal of Arahantship and that this amounts to blindness, but by bringing this blindness to an end and seeing that the process is impersonal the end of pain is attainable and the goal of Arahantship can be reached." />
