					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree, and all its roots going downwards and across would send the sap upwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sustained by that sap, nourished by it, that great tree would stand for a very long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can be clung to, craving increases. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would cut down the tree at its foot, dig it up, and pull out the roots, even the fine rootlets and root-fibre.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would cut the tree into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, and collect the ashes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so, he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that great tree would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating danger in things that can be clung to, craving ceases. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."</p>
