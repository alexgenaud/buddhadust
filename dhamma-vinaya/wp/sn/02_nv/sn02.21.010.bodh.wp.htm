					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a certain bhikkhu named Elder was a lone dweller and spoke in praise of dwelling alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">He entered the village for alms alone, he returned alone, he sat alone in private, he undertook walking meditation alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, <a id="pt283" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.010.pali.bd.htm#pg283"><span class="f2">[283]</span></a> paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, venerable sir, there is a certain bhikkhu named Elder who is a lone dweller and who speaks in praise of dwelling alone."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Elder in my name that the Teacher calls him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," that bhikkhu replied, and he went to the Venerable Elder and told him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Teacher calls you, friend Elder."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the Venerable Elder replied, and he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, Elder, that you are a lone dweller and speak in praise of dwelling alone?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, Elder, are you a lone dweller and how do you speak in praise of dwelling alone?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, venerable sir, I enter the village for alms alone, I return alone, I sit alone in private, and I undertake walking meditation alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way that I am a lone dweller and speak in praise of dwelling alone."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is a way of dwelling alone, Elder, I do not deny this.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to how dwelling alone is fulfilled in detail, listen to that and attend closely, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Elder, is dwelling alone fulfilled in detail?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Elder, what lies in the past has been abandoned, what lies in the future has been relinquished, and desire and lust for present forms of individual existence has been thoroughly removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way, Elder, that dwelling alone is fulfilled in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt284" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.010.pali.bd.htm#pg284"><span class="f2">[284]</span></a> This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The wise one, all-conqueror, all-knower,<br />
							Among all things unsullied, with all cast off,<br />
							Liberated in the destruction of craving:<br />
							I call that person 'one who dwells alone."</p>
