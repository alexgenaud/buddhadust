					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup>Spk explains lust (<i>rāga</i>), delight (<i>nandī</i>), and craving (<i>taṇhā</i>) as synonyms for greed (<i>lobha</i>). <i>Consciousness becomes established there and comes to growth</i> (<i>patiṭṭhitaɱ tattha viññāṇaɱ virū'haɱ</i>): having impelled a kamma, it "becomes established and comes to growth" through its ability to drag along a rebirth. On the establishing of consciousness, see 12:38 and n. 112, and on the descent of name-and-form, 12:39 and n. 115.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup>Spk: <i>Wherever</i> (<i>yattha</i>) is a locative referring to the round of existence with its three planes. Or else, in all instances, this locative is used with reference to the correlative term in the preceding phrase. [Spk-pt: This locative expression <i>yattha ... tattha</i> is used with reference to each preceding phrase, which is its sphere of application.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n172" href="#fn172">172</a>]</sup><i>Atthi tattha saŋkhārānaɱ vuddhi.</i> Spk: This is said with reference to the volitional formations that are the cause of a future round of existence for one abiding in the present round of results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The variation here on the usual sequence is very interesting. When "the growth of volitional formations" is placed between name-and-form and future existence, this implies that the expression corresponds to three critical terms of the standard formula — craving, clinging, and (kamma-)existence — with <i>āyatiɱ punabbhavābhinibbatti</i> signifying the process of entering the new existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n173" href="#fn173">173</a>]</sup>Spk: The painter represents kamma with its adjuncts [Spk-pt: craving and ignorance, and time and destination, etc.]; the panel, wall, or canvas represents the round with its three realms. As the painter creates a figure on the panel, so kamma with its adjuncts creates a form in the realms of existence. As the figure created by an unskilled painter is ugly, deformed, and disagreeable, so the kamma performed with a mind dissociated from knowledge gives rise to an ugly, deformed, disagreeable figure. But as the figure created by a skilled painter is beautiful and well shaped, so the kamma performed with a mind associated with knowledge gives rise to a beautiful and comely figure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n174" href="#fn174">174</a>]</sup>Spk: The kamma of the arahant is similar to the sunbeam. However, the sunbeam does exist, but because there is no place for it to settle it is said to be unestablished (<i>appatiṭṭhitā</i>). But the arahant's kamma is said to be unestablished because it is nonexistent. Although he has a body, etc., no wholesome or unwholesome kamma is thereby created. His deeds are merely functional, not productive of results (<i>kiriyamatte ṭhatvā avipākaɱ hoti</i>). In this connection, see 12:25 and n. 81.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It should be noted that Spk explains the statement that the arahant's <i>consciousness</i> is unestablished to mean that his kamma is unestablished. This seems too free an interpretation. Nevertheless, I think it would be wrong to interpret the sutta as saying that after his parinibbāna the arahant's consciousness persists in some mode that can only be described as unestablished. The present passage is clearly speaking of the arahant's consciousness <i>while he is alive</i>. Its purport is not that an "unestablished consciousness" remains after the arahant's parinibbāna, but that his consciousness, being devoid of lust, does not "become established in" the four nutriments in any way that might generate a future existence.</p>
