					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Venerable Mahā Kassapa was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda  dressed and, <a id="pt215" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.010.pali.bd.htm#pg215"><span class="f2">[215]</span></a> taking bowl and robe, he approached the Venerable Mahā Kassapa and said: "Come, Venerable Kassapa, let us go to the bhikkhunīs' quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You go, friend Ānanda, you're the busy one with many duties."</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Mahā Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, Venerable Kassapa, let us go to the bhikkhunīs' quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You go, friend Ānanda, you're the busy one with many duties."</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Mahā Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, Venerable Kassapa, let us go to the bhikkhunīs' quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Venerable Mahā Kassapa dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the bhikkhunīs' quarters with the Venerable Ānanda as his companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he arrived he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of bhikkhunīs approached the Venerable Mahā Kassapa, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, the Venerable Mahā Kassapa instructed, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened those bhikkhunīs with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the bhikkhunī Thullatissā, being displeased, expressed her displeasure thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How can Master Mahā Kassapa think of speaking on the Dhamma in the presence of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage?</p>

					<p class="f4">For Master Mahā Kassapa to think of speaking on the Dhamma in the presence of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage — this is just as if a needle-peddler <a id="pt216" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.010.pali.bd.htm#pg216"><span class="f2">[216]</span></a> would think he could sell a needle to a needle-maker."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Mahā Kassapa overheard the bhikkhunī Thullatissā making this statement and said to the Venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, friend Ānanda, am I the needle-peddler and you the needle-maker, or am I the needle-maker and you the needle-peddler?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be patient, Venerable Kassapa, women are foolish."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hold it, friend Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't give the Saŋgha occasion to investigate you further.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, friend Ānanda, was it you that the Blessed One brought forward in the presence of the Bhikkhu Saŋgha, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, to whatever extent I wish, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. Ānanda too, to whatever extent he wishes, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, enters and dwells in the first jhāna'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I was the one, friend, that the Blessed One brought forward in the presence of the Bhikkhu Saŋgha, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, to whatever extent I wish, ... I enter and dwell in the first jhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">... Kassapa too, to whatever extent he wishes, enters and dwells in the first jhāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(The same exchange is repeated for the remaining meditative attainments and the six direct knowledges, all as in <a href="sn02.16.009.bodh.wp.htm">the preceding sutta</a>.)</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt217" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.010.pali.bd.htm#pg217"><span class="f2">[217]</span></a> "I was the one, friend, that the Blessed One brought forward in the presence of the Bhikkhu Saŋgha , saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life I enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for myself with direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa too, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for himself with direct knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, one might just as well think that a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits high could be concealed by a palm leaf as think that my six direct knowledges could be concealed."</p>

					<p class="f4">But the bhikkhunī Thullatissā fell away from the holy life.</p>
