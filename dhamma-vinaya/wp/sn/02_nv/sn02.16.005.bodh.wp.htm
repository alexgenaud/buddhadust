					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Mahā Kassapa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You are old now, Kassapa, and those worn-out hempen rag-robes must be burdensome for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore you should wear robes offered by householders, Kassapa, accept meals given on invitation, and dwell close to me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time, venerable sir, I have been a forest dweller and have spoken in praise of forest dwelling; I have been an almsfood eater and have spoken in praise of eating almsfood; I have been a rag-robe wearer and have spoken in praise of wearing rag-robes; I have been a triple-robe user and have spoken in praise of using the triple robe; I have been of few wishes and have spoken in praise of fewness of wishes; I have been content and have spoken in praise of contentment; I have been secluded and have spoken in praise of solitude; I have been aloof from society and have spoken in praise of aloofness from society; I have been energetic and have spoken in praise of arousing energy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Considering what benefit, Kassapa, have you long been a forest dweller ... and spoken in praise of arousing energy?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Considering two benefits, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt203" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.005.pali.bd.htm#pg203"><span class="f2">[203]</span></a> For myself I see a pleasant dwelling in this very life, and I have compassion for later generations, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'May those of later generations follow my example!'</p>

					<p class="f4">For when they hear,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The enlightened disciples of the Buddha were for a long time forest dwellers and spoke in praise of forest dwelling ... were energetic and spoke in praise of arousing energy,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then they will practise accordingly, and that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Considering these two benefits, venerable sir, I have long been a forest dweller ... and have spoken in praise of arousing energy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Kassapa!</p>

					<p class="f4">You are practising for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa, wear worn-out hempen rag-robes, walk for alms, and dwell in the forest."</p>
