					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir." those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is making a thorough investigation, in what way should he thoroughly investigate for the utterly complete destruction of suffering?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, <a id="pt81" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.051.pali.bd.htm#pg81"><span class="f2">[81]</span></a> take recourse in the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, when he makes a thorough investigation, a bhikkhu thoroughly investigates thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world [headed by] aging-and-death: what is the source of this suffering, what is its origin, from what is it born and produced?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists does aging-and-death come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what does not exist does aging-and-death not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he thoroughly investigates he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world [headed by] aging-and-death: this suffering has birth as its source, birth as its origin; it is born and produced from birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be; when there is no birth, aging-and-death does not come to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practises that way and conducts himself accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of aging-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, investigating further, he thoroughly investigates thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the source of this birth, what is its origin, from what is it born and produced? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the source of this existence? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">this clinging? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">this craving? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">this feeling? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">this contact? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">these six sense bases? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">this name-and-form? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">this consciousness? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the source of these volitional formations, what is their origin, from what are they born and produced?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists do volitional formations come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what does not exist do volitional formations not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he thoroughly investigates he understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Volitional formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin; they are born and produced from ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt82" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.051.pali.bd.htm#pg82"><span class="f2">[82]</span></a> When there is ignorance, volitional formations come to be; when there is no ignorance, volitional formations do not come to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He understands volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practises that way and conducts himself accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of volitional formations.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, if a person immersed in ignorance generates a meritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the meritorious; if he generates a demeritorious volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the demeritorious; if he generates an imperturbable volitional formation, consciousness fares on to the imperturbable.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when a bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance and aroused true knowledge, then, with the fading away of ignorance and the arising of true knowledge, he does not generate a meritorious volitional formation, or a demeritorious volitional formation, or an imperturbable volitional formation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since he does not generate or fashion volitional formations, he does not cling to anything in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging, he is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not being agitated, he personally attains Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is impermanent'; he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not held to';</p>

					<p class="f4">he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not delighted in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a painful feeling, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is impermanent';</p>

					<p class="f4">he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not held to';</p>

					<p class="f4">he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not delighted in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is impermanent';</p>

					<p class="f4">he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not held to';</p>

					<p class="f4">he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not delighted in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt83" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.051.pali.bd.htm#pg83"><span class="f2">[83]</span></a> "When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I feel a feeling terminating with the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling terminating with life, he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I feel a feeling terminating with life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here; mere bodily remains will be left.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, a man would remove a hot clay pot from a potter's kiln and set it on smooth ground: its heat would be dissipated right there and potsherds would be left.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when he feels a feeling terminating with the body ... terminating with life. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here; mere bodily remains will be left.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, bhikkhus, can a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed generate a meritorious volitional formation, or a demeritorious volitional formation, or an imperturbable volitional formation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there are utterly no volitional formations, with the cessation of volitional formations, would consciousness be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is utterly no consciousness, with the cessation of consciousness, would name-and-form be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is utterly no name-and-form ... no six sense bases ... <a id="pt84" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.051.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><span class="f2">[84]</span></a> ... no contact ... no feeling ... no craving ... no clinging ... no existence ... no birth, with the cessation of birth, would aging-and-death be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, bhikkhus!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is exactly so and not otherwise!</p>

					<p class="f4">Place faith in me about this, bhikkhus, resolve on this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be free from perplexity and doubt about this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this is the end of suffering."</p>
