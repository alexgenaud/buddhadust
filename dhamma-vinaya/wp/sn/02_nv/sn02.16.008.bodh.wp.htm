					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.008.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.008.rhyc.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> At Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Mahā Kassapa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Exhort the bhikkhus, Kassapa, give them a Dhamma talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I should exhort the bhikkhus, Kassapa, or you should.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I should give them a Dhamma talk or you should."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, the bhikkhus are difficult to admonish now, and they have qualities which make them difficult to admonish.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are impatient and do not accept instruction respectfully."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, Kassapa, in the past the elder bhikkhus were forest dwellers and spoke in praise of forest dwelling; they were almsfood eaters and spoke in praise of eating almsfood; they were rag-robe wearers and spoke in praise of wearing rag-robes; they were triple-robe users and spoke in praise of using the triple robe; they were of few wishes and spoke in praise of fewness of wishes; they were content and spoke in praise of contentment; they were secluded and spoke in praise of solitude; they were aloof from society and spoke in praise of aloofness from society; they were energetic and spoke in praise of arousing energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, when a bhikkhu was a forest dweller and spoke in praise of forest dwelling ... <a id="pt209" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.008.pali.bd.htm#pg209"><span class="f2">[209]</span></a> ... when he was energetic and spoke in praise of arousing energy, the elder bhikkhus would invite him to a seat, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is this bhikkhu's name?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an excellent bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">This bhikkhu is keen on training.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, bhikkhu, here's a seat, sit down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it would occur to the newly ordained bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It seems that when a bhikkhu is a forest dweller and speaks in praise of forest dwelling ... when he is energetic and speaks in praise of arousing energy, the elder bhikkhus invite him to a seat. ...'</p>

					<p class="f4">They would practise accordingly, and that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But now, Kassapa, the elder bhikkhus are no longer forest dwellers and do not speak in praise of forest dwelling ... <a id="pt210" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.008.pali.bd.htm#pg210"><span class="f2">[210]</span></a> ... they are no longer energetic and do not speak in praise of arousing energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is the bhikkhu who is well known and famous, one who gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites, that the elder bhikkhus invite to a seat, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhu. What is this bhikkhu's name?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an excellent bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">This bhikkhu is keen on the company of his brothers in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, bhikkhu, here's a seat, sit down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to the newly ordained bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It seems that when a bhikkhu is well known and famous, one who gains robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites, the elder bhikkhus invite him to a seat. ...'</p>

					<p class="f4">They practise accordingly, and that leads to their harm and suffering for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Kassapa, one speaking rightly could say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those leading the holy life have been ruined by the ruination of those who lead the holy life; those leading the holy life have been vanquished by the vanquishing of those who lead the holy life,' it is just thus that one could rightly say this."</p>
