					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.rhyc.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> On one occasion the Venerable Mahā Kassapa was dwelling in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Ānandawas wandering on tour in Dakkiṇāgiri together with a large Saŋgha of bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion thirty bhikkhus — pupils of the Venerable Ānanda — most of them youngsters, had given up the training and had returned to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt218" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.pali.bd.htm#pg218"><span class="f2">[218]</span></a> When the Venerable Ānanda had wandered on tour in Dakkiṇāgiri as long as he wanted, he came back to Rājagaha to the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">He approached the Venerable Mahā Kassapa, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side, and the Venerable Mahā Kassapa said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Ānanda, for how many reasons did the Blessed One lay down the rule that bhikkhus should not take meals among families in groups of more than three?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Blessed One laid down this rule for three reasons, Venerable Kassapa: for restraining ill-behaved persons and for the comfort of well-behaved bhikkhus, [with the intention,] 'May those of evil wishes, by forming a faction, not create a schism in the Saŋgha!'; and out of sympathy towards families.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for these three reasons, Venerable Kassapa, that the Blessed One laid down this rule."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then why, friend Ānanda, are you wandering about with these young bhikkhus who are unguarded in their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, and not devoted to wakefulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">One would think you were wandering about trampling on crops; one would think you were wandering about destroying families.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your retinue is breaking apart, friend Ānanda, your young followers are slipping away.</p>

					<p class="f4">But still this youngster does not know his measure."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Grey hairs are growing on my head, Venerable Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can't we escape being called a youngster by the Venerable Mahā Kassapa."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt219" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.pali.bd.htm#pg219"><span class="f2">[219]</span></a> "Friend Ānanda, it is just because you wander around with these young bhikkhus who are unguarded in their sense faculties. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">But still this youngster does not know his measure."</p>

					<p class="f4">The bhikkhunīThullatissā heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Mahā Kassapa has disparaged Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage, by calling him a youngster."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, being displeased at this, she expressed her displeasure thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How can Master Mahā Kassapa, who was formerly a member of another sect, think to disparage Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage, by calling him a youngster?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Mahā Kassapa overheard the bhikkhunīThullatissā making this statement and said to the Venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, friend Ānanda, the bhikkhunī Thullatissā made that statement rashly, without consideration.</p>

					<p class="f4">For since I shaved off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and went forth from the home life into homelessness, I do not recall ever having acknowledged any other teacher except the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the past, friend, when I was still a householder, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Household life is confinement, a path of dust, going forth is like the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy for one living at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly purified holy life, which is like polished conch.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then shave off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some time later <a id="pt220" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.pali.bd.htm#pg220"><span class="f2">[220]</span></a> I had an outer robe made from patches of cloth; then, acknowledging those who were arahants in the world [as models], I shaved off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When I had thus gone forth, I was travelling along a road when I saw the Blessed One sitting by the Bahuputta Shrine between Rājagaha and Nālandā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen him, I thought:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6"> <p>The idea here is: "If I am ever to see a Master, it would be this Lucky Man here ... etc."</p> <p><img src="../../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p> </div>

					<p class="f4">'If I should ever see the Teacher, it is the Blessed One himself that I would see.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I should ever see the Fortunate One, it is the Blessed One himself that I would see.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I should ever see the Perfectly Enlightened One, it is the Blessed One himself that I would see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I prostrated myself right there at the Blessed One's feet and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my teacher, I am his disciple.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my teacher, I am his disciple.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When I had said this, the Blessed One said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Kassapa, if one who does not know and see should say to a disciple so single-minded as yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know, I see,"</p>

					<p class="f4">his head would split.</p>

					<p class="f4">But knowing, Kassapa, I say,</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know.";</p>

					<p class="f4">seeing, I say,</p>

					<p class="f4">"I see."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Therefore, Kassapa, you should train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will arouse a keen sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing towards elders, the newly ordained, and those of middle status."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Therefore, Kassapa, you should train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whenever I listen to any Dhamma connected with the wholesome, I will listen to it with eager ears, attending to it as a matter of vital concern, applying my whole mind to it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Therefore, Kassapa, you should train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will never relinquish mindfulness directed to the body associated with joy."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, having given me this exhortation, the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt221" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.pali.bd.htm#pg221"><span class="f2">[221]</span></a> For seven days, friend, I ate the country's almsfood as a debtor, but on the eighth day final knowledge arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, friend, the Blessed One descended from the road and went to the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">I folded in four my outer robe of patches and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One sit down here.</p>

					<p class="f4">This will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One sat down on the appointed seat and said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your outer robe of patches is soft, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One accept my outer robe of patches, out of compassion.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then will you wear my worn-out hempen rag-robes?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I will, venerable sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I offered the Blessed One my outer robe of patches and received from him his worn-out hempen rag-robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, friend, one speaking rightly could say of anyone:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is a son of the Blessed One, born of his breast, born of his mouth, born of the Dhamma, created by the Dhamma, an heir to the Dhamma, a receiver of worn-out hempen rag-robes,'</p>

					<p class="f4">it is of me that one could rightly say this.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, to whatever extent I wish, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, <a id="pt222" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.011.pali.bd.htm#pg222"><span class="f2">[222]</span></a> with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. ...</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(As in <a href="sn02.16.009.bodh.wp.htm">§9,</a> down to:)</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life I enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for myself with direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, one might just as well think that a bull elephant seven or seven and a half cubits high could be concealed by a palm leaf as think that my six direct knowledges could be concealed."</p>

					<p class="f4">But the bhikkhunī Thullatissā fell away from the holy life.</p>
