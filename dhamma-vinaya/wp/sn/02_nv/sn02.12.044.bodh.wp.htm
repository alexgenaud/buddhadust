					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the origin and the passing away of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is the origin of the world?</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, bhikkhus, is the origin of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the ear and sounds ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the nose and odours ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the tongue and tastes ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the body and tactile objects ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging ... existence ... birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. This, bhikkhus, is the origin of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is the passing away of the world? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, bhikkhus, is the passing away of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the ear and sounds ... <a id="pt74" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.044.pali.bd.htm#pg74"><span class="f2">[74]</span></a> ...</p>
