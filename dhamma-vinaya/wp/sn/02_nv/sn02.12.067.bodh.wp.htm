					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Sāriputta and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, friend Sāriputta: Is aging-and-death created by oneself, or is it created by another, <a id="pt113" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.067.pali.bd.htm#pg113"><span class="f2">[113]</span></a> or is it created both by oneself and by another, or has it arisen fortuitously, being created neither by oneself nor by another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Koṭṭhita, aging-and-death is not created by oneself, nor is it created by another, nor is it created both by oneself and by another, nor has it arisen fortuitously, being created neither by oneself nor by another.</p>

					<p class="f4">But rather, with birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, friend Sāriputta: Is birth created by oneself ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Is existence ... clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases ... name-and-form created by oneself, or is it created by another, or is it created both by oneself and by another, or has it arisen fortuitously, being created neither by oneself nor by another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Name-and-form, friend Koṭṭhita, is not created by oneself, nor is it created by another, nor is it created both by oneself and by another, nor has it arisen fortuitously, being created neither by oneself nor by another; but rather, with consciousness as condition, name-and-form [comes to be]."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, friend Sāriputta: Is consciousness created by oneself, or is it created by another, or is it created both by oneself and by another, or has it arisen fortuitously, being created neither by oneself nor by another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness, friend Koṭṭhita, is not created by oneself, nor is it created by another, nor is it created both by oneself and by another, nor has it arisen fortuitously, being created neither by oneself nor by another; but rather, with name-and-form as condition, consciousness [comes to be]."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt114" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.067.pali.bd.htm#pg114"><span class="f2">[114]</span></a> "Now we understand the Venerable Sāriputta's statement thus: 'Name-and-form, friend Koṭṭhita, is not created by oneself ... but rather, with consciousness as condition, name-and-form [comes to be].'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now we also understand the Venerable Sāriputta's [other] statement thus: 'Consciousness, friend Koṭṭhita, is not created by oneself ... but rather, with name-and-form as condition, consciousness [comes to be].'</p>

					<p class="f4">But how, friend Sāriputta should the meaning of this statement be seen?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, friend, I will make up a simile for you, for some intelligent people here understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as two sheaves of reeds might stand leaning against each other, so too, with name-and-form as condition, consciousness [comes to be]; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form [comes to be].</p>

					<p class="f4">With name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases [come to be]; with the six sense bases as condition, contact. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, friend, one were to remove one of those sheaves of reeds, the other would fall, and if one were to remove the other sheaf, the first would fall.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, with the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is amazing, friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">How well this has been stated by the Venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">We rejoice in the Venerable Sāriputta's statement on these thirty-six grounds:</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friend, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma for the purpose of revulsion towards aging-and-death, for its fading away and cessation, he can be called a bhikkhu who is a speaker on the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt115" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.067.pali.bd.htm#pg115"><span class="f2">[115]</span></a> If a bhikkhu is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards aging-and-death, for its fading away and cessation, he can be called a bhikkhu who is practising in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">If through revulsion towards aging-and-death, through its fading away and cessation, a bhikkhu is liberated by nonclinging, he can be called a bhikkhu who has attained Nibbāna in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, friend, a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma for the purpose of revulsion towards birth ... existence ... clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases ... name-and-form ... consciousness ... volitional formations ... ignorance, for its fading away and cessation, he can be called a bhikkhu who is a speaker on the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a bhikkhu is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards ignorance, for its fading away and cessation, he can be called a bhikkhu who is practising in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">If through revulsion towards ignorance, through its fading away and cessation, a bhikkhu is liberated by nonclinging, he can be called a bhikkhu who has attained Nibbāna in this very life."</p>
