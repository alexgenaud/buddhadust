					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, what do you think, what kind of bhikkhu is worthy to be a visitor of families, and what kind of bhikkhu is not worthy to be a visitor of families?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One. ..."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might approach families with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May they give to me, not hold back!</p>

					<p class="f4">May they give me much, not a little!</p>

					<p class="f4">May they give me fine things, not shabby things!</p>

					<p class="f4">May they give me promptly, not slowly!</p>

					<p class="f4">May they give me considerately, not casually!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When a bhikkhu approaches families with such a thought, if they do not give, he thereby becomes hurt; on that account he experiences pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they give little rather than much ...</p>

					<p class="f4">If they give shabby things rather than fine things ...</p>

					<p class="f4">If they give slowly rather than promptly ...</p>

					<p class="f4">If they give casually rather than considerately, he thereby becomes hurt; <a id="pt201" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.004.pali.bd.htm#pg201"><span class="f2">[201]</span></a> on that account he experiences pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bhikkhu is not worthy to be a visitor of families.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might approach families with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When among others' families, how could I possibly think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May they give to me, not hold back! ...</p>

					<p class="f4">May they give me respectfully, not casually."?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When a bhikkhu approaches families with such a thought, if they do not give ...</p>

					<p class="f4">if they give casually rather than considerately, he does not thereby become hurt; he does not on that account experience pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bhikkhu is worthy to be a visitor of families.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, Kassapa approaches families with such a thought. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus if they do not give ...</p>

					<p class="f4">if they give casually rather than considerately, he does not thereby become hurt; <a id="pt202" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.004.pali.bd.htm#pg202"><span class="f2">[202]</span></a> he does not on that account experience pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one who is similar to Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being exhorted, you should practise accordingly."</p>
