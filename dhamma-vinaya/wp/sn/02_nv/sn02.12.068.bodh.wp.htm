<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 4. Kalarakhattiyo Vagga), Sutta 68. Venerable Savittha questions the Venerable Musila about whether or not apart from belief, inclination, hearsay, argument as to method, reflection on and approval of an opinion, he has, as his very own, the knowledge of the various steps of the Paticca Samuppada and of the knowledge that the ending of becoming is Nibbana. In all cases he states that he has such knowldge. And when the Venerable Savittha declares him an arahant he remains silent. Then the Venerable Narada, who has overheard this dialogue asks that the same questions be asked of him and when asked he responds in the same way. But when Savittha pronounces him too an arahant, Narada explains that while he has personal knowledge of these things, he has not attained them. And he gives the simile of the thirsty man who comes across a well with no means to retrieve the water." />

					<p class="f4">Then a man would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat, tired, parched, and thirsty.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would look down into the well and the knowledge would occur to him, 'There is water,' but he would not be able to make bodily contact with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When he speaks in such a way, friend Ānanda, I would not say anything about the Venerable Nārada except what is good and favourable."</p>
