					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, there is a descent of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">With consciousness as condition, name-and-form [comes to be]. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree, and all its roots going downwards and across would send the sap upwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sustained by that sap, nourished by it, that great tree would stand for a very long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, there is a descent of consciousness. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, there is no descent of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of consciousness comes cessation of name-and-form. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would cut down the tree at its foot ... he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that great tree would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, there is no descent of consciousness. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."</p>
