					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> [230] This attempt to combine into one series the discrete sequences beginning with contact and perception leads to some strange incongruities, which become even more bizarre among the negations of the following sutta. Elsewhere contact is said to be the condition for the manifestation of the aggregates of feeling, perception, and volitional formations (e.g., at 22:82 (III 101, 33 — 102,2), and see 35:93 (IV 68, 15 — 16)); yet here contact and feeling are said to be dependent on perception and intention. Neither Spk nor Spk-pt shows any signs of uneasiness over the discrepancies nor tries to justify them.<br />
					At MN I 111, 35 — 112,13 a sequence of mental phenomena is given as follows: contact &gt; perception &gt; thought &gt; conceptual proliferation &gt; obsession by perceptions and notions arisen from proliferation. The texts often treat thought <i>(vitakka)</i> as identical with intention <i>(saºkappa);</i> proliferation <i>(papañca)</i> includes craving <i>(taṇhā),</i> which is synonymous with desire <i>(chanda);</i> and obsession <i>(samudācāra)</i> may comprise passions and quests, etc. This would then give us a more cogent version of the series. Spk does in fact refer to one elder, Uruvelāyavāsī Cū'atissa Thera, who said: "Although the Blessed One inserted contact and feeling in the middle of the text, having turned the text back <i>(Pāliɱ pana parivaṭṭetvā)</i> we  get: perception, intention, desire, passion, quest, and gain in regard to the stated object (form, etc.), 'gain of form' being the object gained together with craving; then there is contact as the (mental) contact with the object gained and feeling as the experiencing of the object. In such a way this pair — contact with form and feeling  — is found."<br />
					Spk continues on its own: "And here, perception, intention, contact, feeling, and desire are found both in the same <i>javana</i> process and in different <i>javana</i> processes, while passion, quest, and gain are found only in different <i>javana</i> processes."</p>
