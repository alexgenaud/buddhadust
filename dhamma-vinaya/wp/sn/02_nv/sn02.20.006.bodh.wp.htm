					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n365" href="#fn365">365</a>]</sup> This sutta also appears in the introduction to Ja No. 476, which turns upon the same theme. In this story the Bodhisatta, in his incarnation as the swift goose Javanahatylsa, performs the remarkable feat to be described just below.<br />
					Spk explains the stock description of the archers thus:<br />
					Firm-bowed archers <i>(dalhadhammā dhanuggahā):</i> archers with firm bows <i>(dalhadhanuno issāsā).</i> A "firm bow" is called the strength of two thousand. "The strength of two thousand" means that a weight of metal, such as bronze or lead, etc. (used for the arrowhead), bound to the string when the bow is lifted (for the shot), is released from the earth when the bow is grasped by its handle and drawn back the full length of the arrow. Trained (Se and Ee: <i>sikkhitā;</i> Be: <i>susikkhitā,</i> "well trained"): they have studied the craft in their teacher's circle for ten or twelve years. Dexterous <i>(katahatthā):</i> one who has simply studied a craft is not yet dexterous, but these are dexterous, having achieved mastery over it. Experienced <i>(katupāsanā)</i>: they have displayed their craft in the king's court, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n366" href="#fn366">366</a>]</sup> <i>Ayusankhārā.</i> Spk: This is said with reference to the physical life faculty <i>(rupajivitindriya);</i> for this perishes even faster than that. But it is not possible to describe the breakup of formless phenomena (i.e., of mental states, because according to the Abhidhamma they break up sixteen times faster than material phenomena).</p>
