					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna were dwelling at Rājagaha in a single dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Moggallāna, your faculties are serene, your facial complexion is pure and bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna spent the day in a peaceful dwelling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I spent the day in a gross dwelling, friend, but I did have some Dhamma talk."</p>

					<p class="f4">"With whom did the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna have some Dhamma talk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I had some Dhamma talk with the Blessed One, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But the Blessed One is far away, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is now dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna approach the Blessed One by means of spiritual power, or did the Blessed One approach the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna by means of spiritual power."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt276" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.003.pali.bd.htm#pg276"><span class="f2">[276]</span></a> "I didn't approach the Blessed One by means of spiritual power, friend, nor did the Blessed One approach me by means of spiritual power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rather, the Blessed One cleared his divine eye and divine ear element to communicate with me, and I cleared my divine eye and divine ear element to communicate with the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What kind of Dhamma talk did the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna have with the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend, I said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, it is said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"one with energy aroused, one with energy aroused."</p>

					<p class="f4">In what way, venerable sir, does one have energy aroused?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, Moggallāna, a bhikkhu with energy aroused dwells thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, by manly energy, by manly exertion."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way, Moggallāna, that one has aroused energy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, friend, is the Dhamma talk that I had with the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, compared to the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna we are like a few grains of gravel compared to the Himalayas, the king of mountains.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna is of such great spiritual power and might that if so he wished he could live on for an aeon."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, compared to the Venerable Sāriputta we are like a few grains of salt compared to a barrel of salt.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt277" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.003.pali.bd.htm#pg277"><span class="f2">[277]</span></a> For the Venerable Sāriputta has been extolled, lauded, and praised in many ways by the Blessed One:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"'As Sāriputta is supreme<br />
							In wisdom, virtue, and peace,<br />
							So a bhikkhu who has gone beyond<br />
							At best can only equal him."</p>

					<p class="f4">In this manner both these great nāgas rejoiced in what was well stated and well declared by the other.</p>
