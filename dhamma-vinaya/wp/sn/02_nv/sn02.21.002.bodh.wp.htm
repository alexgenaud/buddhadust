					<p class="f4">There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend." those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friends, when I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there anything in the world through the change and alteration of which sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair might arise in me?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is nothing in the world through the change and alteration of which sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair might arise in me."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, wouldn't sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise in you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, still sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, it would occur to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Teacher, so influential, so powerful and mighty, has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Blessed One had lived for a long time, that would have been for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt275" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.002.pali.bd.htm#pg275"><span class="f2">[275]</span></a> "It must be because I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Vener-able Sāriputta for a long time that even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, still sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise in him."</p>
