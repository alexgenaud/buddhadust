					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Venerable Mahā Kassapa and the Venerable Sāriputta were dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahā Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exchanged greetings with the Venerable Mahā Kassapa and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, it is said that one who is not ardent and who is unafraid of wrongdoing is incapable of enlightenment, incapable of Nibbāna, incapable of achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage; but one who is ardent <a id="pt196" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.002.pali.bd.htm#pg196"><span class="f2">[196]</span></a> and afraid of wrongdoing is capable of enlightenment, capable of Nibbāna capable of achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what way is this so, friend?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend, a bhikkhu does not arouse ardour by thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If unarisen evil unwholesome states arise in me, this may lead to my harm';</p>

					<p class="f4">nor by thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If evil unwholesome states that have arisen in me are not abandoned, this may lead to my harm';</p>

					<p class="f4">nor by thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If unarisen wholesome states do not arise in me, this may lead to my harm';</p>

					<p class="f4">nor by thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If wholesome states that have arisen in me cease, this may lead to my harm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is not ardent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, friend, is he unafraid of wrongdoing?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, friend, a bhikkhu does not become afraid at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If unarisen evil unwholesome states arise in me, this may lead to my harm' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">nor at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If wholesome states that have arisen in me cease, this may lead to my harm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is unafraid of wrongdoing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in this way, friend, that one who is not ardent and who is unafraid of wrongdoing is incapable of enlightenment, incapable of Nibbāna incapable of achieving the unsurpassed security from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, friend, is one ardent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, friend, a bhikkhu arouses ardour by thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If unarisen evil unwholesome states arise in me, this may lead to my harm' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">and by thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If wholesome states that have arisen in me cease, this may lead to my harm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is ardent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, friend, is he afraid of wrongdoing?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, friend, a bhikkhu becomes afraid at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If unarisen evil unwholesome states arise in me, this may lead to my harm'; ...</p>

					<p class="f4">and at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If wholesome states that have arisen in me cease, this may lead to my harm.'</p>
