<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 4. Kalarakhattiyo Vagga), Sutta 62. The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he describes how it is that consciousness arises through contact, sense-experience and perception and that it is by perceiving that that detachment leads to freedom and the knowledge of freedom." />

					<p class="f4">'When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant, a pleasant feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding feeling — the pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be experienced as pleasant — ceases and subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on a contact to be experienced as painful, a painful feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding feeling — the painful feeling <a id="pt97" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.062.pali.bd.htm#pg97"><span class="f2">[97]</span></a> that arose in dependence on that contact to be experienced as painful — ceases and subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, the corresponding feeling — the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant — ceases and subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, just as heat is generated and fire is produced from the conjunction and friction of two fire-sticks, but with the separation and laying aside of the sticks the resultant heat ceases and subsides; so too, in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant ... a contact to be experienced as painful ... a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, the corresponding feeling ... ceases and subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards contact, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is liberated there comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's liberated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being."</p>
