					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Venerable Mahā Moggallāna addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend." those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Mahā Moggallāna said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friends, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is said, "noble silence, noble silence."</p>

					<p class="f4">What now is noble silence?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, friends, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called noble silence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, friends, with the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelt in the second jhāna, which ... has rapture and happiness born of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I dwelt therein, perception and attention accompanied by thought assailed me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of spiritual power and said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Moggallāna, Moggallāna, do not be negligent regarding noble silence, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Steady your mind in noble silence, unify your mind in noble silence, concentrate your mind on noble silence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, friends, on a later occasion, with the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelt in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, <a id="pt274" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.001.pali.bd.htm#pg274"><span class="f2">[274]</span></a> friends, one speaking rightly could say of anyone:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is a disciple who attained to greatness of direct knowledge with the assistance of the Teacher,'</p>

					<p class="f4">it is of me that one could rightly say this."</p>
