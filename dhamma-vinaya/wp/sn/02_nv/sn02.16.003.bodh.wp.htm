					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, you should approach families like the moon — <a id="pt198" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.003.pali.bd.htm#pg198"><span class="f2">[198]</span></a> drawing back the body and mind, always acting like newcomers, without impudence towards families. Just as a man looking down an old well, a precipice, or a steep riverbank would draw back the body and mind, so too, bhikkhus, should you approach families.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, Kassapa approaches families like the moon — drawing back the body and mind, always acting like a newcomer, without impudence towards families.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, bhikkhus, what kind of bhikkhu is worthy to approach families?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One waved his hand in space and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, just as this hand does not get caught in space, is not held fast by it, is not bound by it, so when a bhikkhu approaches families his mind does not get caught, held fast, and bound amidst families, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May those desiring gains acquire gains, may those desiring merits make merits!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is as elated and happy over the gains of others as he is over his own gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bhikkhu is worthy to approach families.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when Kassapa approaches families his mind does not get caught, held fast, or bound amidst families, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May those desiring gains acquire gains, may those desiring merits make merits!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is as elated and happy over the gains of others as he is over his own gains.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt199" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.003.pali.bd.htm#pg199"><span class="f2">[199]</span></a> "What do you think, bhikkhus, how is a bhikkhu's teaching of the Dhamma impure, and how is his teaching of the Dhamma pure?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One. ..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh, may they listen to the Dhamma from me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having listened, may they gain confidence in the Dhamma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Being confident, may they show their confidence to me!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bhikkhu's teaching of the Dhamma is impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But a bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma to others with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Oh, may they listen to the Dhamma from me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having listened, may they understand the Dhamma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having understood, may they practise accordingly!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he teaches the Dhamma to others because of the intrinsic excellence of the Dhamma; he teaches the Dhamma to others from compassion and sympathy, out of tender concern.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bhikkhu's teaching of the Dhamma is pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, Kassapa teaches the Dhamma to others with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Oh, <a id="pt200" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.003.pali.bd.htm#pg200"><span class="f2">[200]</span></a> may they listen to the Dhamma from me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having listened, may they understand the Dhamma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having understood, may they practise accordingly!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches the Dhamma to others because of the intrinsic excellence of the Dhamma; he teaches the Dhamma to others from compassion and sympathy, out of tender concern.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one who is similar to Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being exhorted, you should practise accordingly."</p>
