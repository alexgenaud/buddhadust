					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at
					Vesālī in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that
					occasion the Venerable Visākha Paācāliputta was instructing, exhorting,
					inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a
					Dhamma talk, [spoken] with speech that was polished, clear, articulate,
					expressing well the meaning, comprehensive, unattached.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and
					approached the assembly hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sat down in the appointed seat and
					addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, who has been instructing,
					exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall
					with a Dhamma talk, [spoken] with speech that is polished, clear,
					articulate, expressing well the meaning, comprehensive, unattached?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It was this Venerable Visākha Paācāliputta, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Visākha Paācāliputta thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Visākha!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good that you thus instruct the
					bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said ... [who] further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When the wise man is in the midst of fools<br />
							They do not know him if he does not speak,<br />
							But they know him when he speaks,<br />
							Pointing out the deathless state.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"He should speak and explain the Dhamma,<br />
							He should raise high the seers' banner.<br />
							Well-spoken words are the seers' banner:<br />
							For the Dhamma is the banner of seers."</p>
