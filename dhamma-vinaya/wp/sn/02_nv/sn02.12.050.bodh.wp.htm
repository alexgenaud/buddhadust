					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, an instructed noble disciple does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists do volitional formations come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists does consciousness come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists does name-and-form come to be? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">When what exists does aging-and-death come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rather, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple has knowledge about this that is independent of others:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is ignorance, volitional formations come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there are volitional formations, consciousness comes to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is consciousness, name-and-form comes to be. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such a way the world originates.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, an instructed noble disciple does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When what does not exist does what not come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of what does what cease?</p>

					<p class="f4">When what does not exist do volitional formations not come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rather, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple has knowledge about this that is independent of others:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when a noble disciple thus understands as they really are the origin and the passing away of the world, he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses a trainee's knowledge, a trainee's true knowledge, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless."</p>
