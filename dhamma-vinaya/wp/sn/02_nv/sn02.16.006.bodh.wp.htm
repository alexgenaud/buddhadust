					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Mahā Kassapa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Exhort the bhikkhus, Kassapa, give them a Dhamma talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I <a id="pt204" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.006.pali.bd.htm#pg204"><span class="f2">[204]</span></a> should exhort the bhikkhus, Kassapa, or you should.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I should give them a Dhamma talk or you should."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, the bhikkhus are difficult to admonish now, and they have qualities which make them difficult to admonish.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are impatient and do not accept instruction respectfully.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, venerable sir, I saw a bhikkhu named Bhaṇḍa, a pupil of Ānanda, and a bhikkhu named AAbhiñjika, a pupil of Anuruddha, competing with each other in regard to their learning, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhu, who can speak more?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who can speak better?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who can speak longer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Bhaṇḍa, and the bhikkhu AAbhiñjika, in my name that the Teacher calls them."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," that bhikkhu replied, and he went to those bhikkhus and told them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Teacher calls the venerable ones."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied, and they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, bhikkhus, that you have been competing with each other in regard to your learning, as to who can speak more, who can speak better, who can speak longer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, bhikkhus, compete with each other in regard to your learning, and see who can speak more, who can speak better, who can speak longer'?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt205" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.006.pali.bd.htm#pg205"><span class="f2">[205]</span></a> "No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then if you have never known me to teach the Dhamma thus, what do you senseless men know and see that, having gone forth in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline, you compete with each other in regard to your learning, as to who can speak more, who can speak better, who can speak longer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those bhikkhus prostrated themselves with their heads at the Blessed One's feet and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, we have committed a transgression — so foolish, so confused, so inept were we — in that, having gone forth in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline, we competed with each other in regard to our learning, as to who can speak more, who can speak better, who can speak longer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, may the Blessed One pardon us for our transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, bhikkhus, you have committed a transgression — so foolish, so confused, so inept were you — in that, having gone forth in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline, you competed with each other in regard to your learning. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we pardon you for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is growth in the Noble One's Discipline when one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint."</p>
