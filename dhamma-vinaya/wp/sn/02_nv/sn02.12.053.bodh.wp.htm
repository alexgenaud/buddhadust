					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, craving increases.</p>

					<p class="f4">With craving as condition, clinging [comes to be]; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, an oil lamp was burning in dependence on oil and a wick, and a man would pour oil into it and adjust the wick from time to time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, sustained by that oil, fuelled by it, that oil lamp would burn for a very long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, craving increases. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence ... cessation of birth ... aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, an oil lamp was burning in dependence on oil and a wick, and the man would not pour oil into it or adjust the wick from time to time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, when the former supply of fuel is exhausted, that oil lamp, not being fed with any more fuel, lacking sustenance, would be extinguished.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when one lives contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."</p>
