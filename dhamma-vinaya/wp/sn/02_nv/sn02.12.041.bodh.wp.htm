The Buddha tells Anāthapiṇḍika that when a layman is able to identify in himself that he is free from the five sources of guilty dread in poor ethical behavior, when he has solid faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha, and when he has wised up to the aristocratic method, he may call himself a Streamwinner and assure himself that rebirth below human states is finished." />

					<p class="f4">At Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, when five fearful animosities have subsided in a noble disciple, and he possesses the four factors of stream-entry, and he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom the noble method, if he wishes he could by himself declare of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one finished with hell, finished with the animal realm, finished with the domain of ghosts, finished with the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as my destination.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the five fearful animosities that have subsided?</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, one who destroys life engenders, on account of such behaviour, fearful animosity pertaining to the present life and fearful animosity pertaining to the future life, and he experiences mental pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for one who abstains from destroying life, this fearful animosity has subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">"One who takes what is not given ... <a id="pt69" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.041.pali.bd.htm#pg69"><span class="f2">[69]</span></a> ... who engages in sexual misconduct ... who speaks falsely ... who indulges in wine, liquor, and intoxicants that are a basis for negligence engenders, on account of such behaviour, fearful animosity pertaining to the present life and fearful animosity pertaining to the future life, and he experiences mental pain and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for one who abstains from wine, liquor, and intoxicants that are a basis for negligence, this fearful animosity has subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five fearful animosities that have subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses? Here, householder, the noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He possesses confirmed confidence in the Saŋgha thus: 'The Saŋgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way, practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals — this <a id="pt70" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.041.pali.bd.htm#pg70"><span class="f2">[70]</span></a> Saŋgha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones — unbroken, untorn, unblemished, unmottled, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom? Here, householder, the noble disciple attends closely and carefully to dependent origination itself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations [come to be]; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, householder, these five fearful animosities have subsided in a noble disciple, and he possesses these four factors of stream-entry, and he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom this noble method, if he wishes he could by himself declare of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one finished with hell, finished with the animal realm, finished with the domain of ghosts, finished with the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as my destination."</p>
