					<p class="f4">"'Fisherman,' bhikkhus: this is a designation for Māra the Evil One. 'Baited hook': this is a designation for gain, honour, and praise.

Thus should you train yourselves."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n316" href="#fn316">316</a>]</sup>316 Spk: Gain (liibha) is the gain of the four requisites; honour (sakkiira), the gain of (requisites) that are well made and well produced; praise (siloka), acclamation (va1;l1;laghosa).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n317" href="#fn317">317</a>]</sup>317 Pali indiscriminately uses two words, kumma and kacchapa, for both turtle and tortoise. Here kumma refers to the lakedwelling variety, but at 35:240 kumma kacchapa jointly denote what seems to be a land-dwelling creature, while at 56:47 kacchapa alone refers to the sea-dwelling variety. Spk glosses mahiikummakula with mahanta1!l atfhikacchapakula, which further confirms the interchangeability of the two words. I have rendered both terms "turtle" when they denote a predominantly aquatic creature (here and at 56:47), "tortoise" when they refer to a land-dwelling creature.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n318" href="#fn318">318</a>]</sup>318 Papatii. Spk explains this as an iron spear shaped like a hooked dart, kept in an iron case. When it is dropped on its target with a certain force, the spear comes out from the case and the rope follows along, still attached to it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n319" href="#fn319">319</a>]</sup>319 Although all three eds. read giddho papatiiya, it seems we should read viddho papatiiya, proposed by a note in Be.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n320" href="#fn320">320</a>]</sup>320 In all three eds. the text as it stands is unintelligible and is likely to be corrupt. Spk does not offer enough help to reconstruct an original reading, while Be appends a long note with a circuitous explanation intended to resolve the difficulties. I would prefer to amend the final verb in Be and Se (and SS) from anupiipu1;liitu to anupiipu1;liiti so that we read: Ka1!l bhikkhave asanivicakka1!l iigacchatu? Sekha1!l appattamiinasa1!l liibhasakkiirasiloko anupiipu1;liiti. Ee does have anupiipu1;liiti, and it is possible anupiipu1;liitu entered the other eds. under the influence of the preceding iigacchatu and the corresponding sentences in 17:23, 24.<br />
					Spk paraphrases the question: "Which person should a bright thunderbolt strike, hitting him on the head and crushing him?" and comments on the reply: "The Blessed One does not speak thus because he desires suffering for beings, but in order to show the danger. For a lightning bolt, striking one on the head, destroys only a single individual existence, but one with a mind obsessed- by gain, honour, and praise experiences endless suffering in hell, etc." Who has not yet reached his mind's ideal (appattamiinasa): who has not achieved arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n321" href="#fn321">321</a>]</sup>321 Be and Se read: Ka1!l bhikkhave diddhagatena visallena sallena vijjhatu? The reading in Ee is less satisfactory. Spk:<br />
					Diddhagatenii ti gatadiddhena [Spk-pt: acchavisayuttii ti vii diddhe gatena]; visallenii ti visamakkhitena; sallenii ti sattiyii.<br />
					The rhetorical construction parallels that in the preceding sutta. Visallena is problematic, and we might accept C.Rh.D's suggestion visa-sallena, though diddha (= Skt digdha) already conveys the idea of poisoned. See Ja IV 435,26: Sara diddho kaliipa1!l va/Alitta1!l upalimpati.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n322" href="#fn322">322</a>]</sup>322 Ukka1;ltaka (so Be and Se; Ee: ukka1;l1;laka). Spk: This is the name of a disease, said tb arise in the cold season. The hairs fall off from the entire body, and the entire body, fully exposed, breaks open all over. Struck by the wind, the wounds ooze. Just as a man, bitten by a rabid dog, runs around in circles, so does the jackal when it has contracted this disease, and there is no place where it finds safety.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n323" href="#fn323">323</a>]</sup>323 Verambhaviitii. Spk: A strong type of wind, discerned at a height from which the four continents appear the size of lotus leaves.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n324" href="#fn324">324</a>]</sup>324 This verse and the next are at Th 1011-12 and It 74,22-75,3.<br />
					Here I read with Be and Se appamii1;lavihiirino, as against Ee appamiidavihiirino. The latter, however, is found in all three eds. of Th lO11d; readings of It 74,25 are divided. Spk supports appamii1;la- with its gloss: appamii1;lena phalasamiidhinii viharantassa; "as he is dwelling in the measureless fruition concentration." Th-a does not comment on the pada at Th 1011, and the comment in It-a reads appamiida- in Be and appamii1;la- in Se.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n325" href="#fn325">325</a>]</sup>325 We should read pada b with Se sukhumaditfhivipassaka1!l as against sukhuma1!l ditthivipassaka1!l in Be and Ee. The former is also the reading at Th 1012b and It 75,1. Spk: It is a subtle view because (it is reached) through the view of the path of arahantship, and he is an insight-seer (vipassaka) because he has arrived there after having set up insight for the sake of fruition attainment. Delighting in the destruction of clinging:<br />
					Delighted with Nibbana, called the destruction of clinging. </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n326" href="#fn326">326</a>]</sup>326 The suva1;l1;lanikkha and the singinikkha seem to be two different types of golden coin, the latter presumably of greater value than the former, or made from a superior species of gold. Spk glosses suvat:lt:lanikkhassa as ekassa kaficananikkhassa, and siliginikkhassa as siligisuvmp;.anikkhassa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n327" href="#fn327">327</a>]</sup>327 Janapadakalycl1;.i. See below 17:22 and 47:20, and the famous simile at MN II 33,6--22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n328" href="#fn328">328</a>]</sup>328 Cpo AN I 88,13-89,3. This sutta and the next seem to be quoting from AN II 164,4-22, where the Buddha names the "standards and criteria" for the four classes of his followers. Citta the householder was the foremost male lay disciple among the speakers on the Dhamma; see the Cittasaqlyutta (41:1-10). Hatthaka A!avaka was the foremost of those who propitiate an assembly with the four means of beneficence; see AN I 26,5-9 and AN IV 217-20, and I, n.604.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n329" href="#fn329">329</a>]</sup>329 Khujjuttara was the foremost female lay disciple among those who have learned much, Ve!ukaI).9akiya (or Uttara) Nandamata the foremost of the meditators; see AN I 26,19, 21. Khema and UppalavaI).I).a, mentioned just below, were the foremost bhikkhunis in regard to wisdom and spiritual power, respectively. UppalavaI).I).a has appeared at 5:5, and Khema gives a discourse at 44:1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n330" href="#fn330">330</a>]</sup>330 See above n. 249.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n331" href="#fn331">331</a>]</sup>331 Spk: Its origin (samudaya): an individual form of existence together with past kamma, status as a son of good family, beauty of complexion, eloquence as a speaker, the display of ascetic virtues, the wearing of the robe, possession of a retinue, etc., are called the origin of gain and honour. They do not understand this by way of the truth of the origin, and so cessation and the path should be understood by way of the truths of cessation and the path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n332" href="#fn332">332</a>]</sup>332 Spk: The pleasant dwellings in this very life (ditthadhammasukhavihiirii) are the pleasant dwellings in fruition attainment. For when a meritorious arahant receives conjee, sweets, etc., he must give thanks to those who come, teach them the Dhamma, answer questions, etc., and thus he does not get a chance to sit down and enter fruition attainment.<br />
					Spk's identificationu of the "pleasant dwellings" with fruition attainment is certainly too narrow. The term usually means the jhanas, as at II 278,10-11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n333" href="#fn333">333</a>]</sup>333 The three wholesome roots are nongreed, nonhatred, and nondelusion. Spk explains this to mean that the wholesome roots have been cut off to such an extent that Devadatta is incapable of taking rebirth in heaven or of achieving the path and fruit; it does not mean that his wholesome roots have been permanently eradicated. The next two suttas state the same meaning using different terms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n334" href="#fn334">334</a>]</sup>334 This sutta and the following one also occur at Vin II 187-88 in inverted order, without the homily on gains, honour, and fame, and with the verse at the end. See too AN II 73. The verse = I, v. 597, also spoken with reference to Devadatta. On the simile of the mule just below, Spk says that they mate her with a horse. If she becomes pregnant, when her time for delivery arrives she is unable to give birth. She stands striking the ground with her feet. Then they tie her feet to four stakes, split open her belly, and remove the foal. She dies right there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n335" href="#fn335">335</a>]</sup>335 Pittaf!l bhindeyyuf!l. PED, S.V. pittaf!l, says the passage is unclear and refers to an alternative interpretation proposed by Morris, JPTS 1893, 4. My rendering accords with Spk's comment: "They throw (pakhippeyyuf!l) bear bile or fish bile over its nostrils." Spk-pt glosses pakhippeyyuf!l here with osificeyyuf!l, "they sprinkle." Horner renders "as if they were to throw a bladder at a fierce dog's nose" (BD 5:263).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n336" href="#fn336">336</a>]</sup>336 Spk: When bandits grab hold of his mother in the wilderness and say they will release her only if he tells a deliberate lie, even then he won't tell a deliberate lie. The same method in the other cases.</p>
