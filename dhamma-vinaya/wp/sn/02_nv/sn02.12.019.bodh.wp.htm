The Buddha draws the distinction between the fool born identifying with body and pulled around by desires and the wise man born identifying with body and pulled around by desires: the wise man takes on the burden of the holy life and gives up his blindness and thirsts for pleasures of the senses where the fool does not." />

					<p class="f4">What, bhikkhus, is the distinction here, what is the disparity, what is the difference between the wise man and the fool?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, for the fool, hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has originated.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the fool that ignorance has not been abandoned and that craving has not been utterly destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the fool has not lived the holy life for the complete destruction of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, with the breakup of the body, the fool fares on to [another] body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Faring on to [another] body, he is not freed from birth, aging, and death; not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; not freed from suffering, I say.</p>
