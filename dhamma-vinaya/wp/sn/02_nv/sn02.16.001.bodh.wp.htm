					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, this Kassapa is content with any kind of robe, and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of robe, and he does not engage in a wrong search, in what is improper, for the sake of a robe. If he does not get a robe he is not agitated, and if he gets one he uses it without being tied to it, uninfatuated with it, not blindly absorbed in it, seeing the danger in it, understanding the escape.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, this Kassapa is content with any kind of almsfood ... with any kind of lodging ... with any kind of medicinal requisites ... and if he gets them he uses them without being tied to them, uninfatuated with them, not blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger in them, understanding the escape.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus:</p>
