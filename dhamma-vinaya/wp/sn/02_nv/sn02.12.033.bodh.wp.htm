					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I will teach you forty-four cases of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, what are the forty-four cases of knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt57" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.033.pali.bd.htm#pg57"><span class="f2">[57]</span></a> Knowledge of aging-and-death, knowledge of its origin, knowledge of its cessation, knowledge of the way leading to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of birth ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of existence ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of clinging ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of craving ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of feeling ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of contact ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of the six sense bases ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of name-and-form ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of consciousness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge of volitional formations, knowledge of their origin, knowledge of their cessation, knowledge of the way leading to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, bhikkhus, are the forty-four cases of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death?... <a href="sn02.12.002.bodh.wp.htm"><i>(definitions as in §2)</i></a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this aging and this death are together called aging-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the arising of birth there is the arising of aging-and-death.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aging-and-death. </p>

					<p class="f4">This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of aging-and-death; that is, right view ... right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple thus understands aging-and-death, its origin, <a id="pt58" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.033.pali.bd.htm#pg58"><span class="f2">[58]</span></a> its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, this is his knowledge of the principle.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of this principle that is seen, understood, immediately attained, fathomed, he applies the method to the past and to the future thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, all these directly knew it in the very same way that I do now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will directly know aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, all these will directly know it in the very same way that I do now.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is his knowledge of entailment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds of knowledge — knowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment — he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses a trainee's knowledge, a trainee's true knowledge, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is birth? ...</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the volitional formations? ...</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="sn02.12.002.bodh.wp.htm"><i>(definitions as in §2)</i></a> <a id="pt59" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.033.pali.bd.htm#pg59"><span class="f2">[59]</span></a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations; that is, right view ... right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple thus understands volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation, this is his knowledge of the principle.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of this principle that is seen, understood, immediately attained, fathomed, he applies the method to the past and to the future. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is his knowledge of entailment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two kinds of knowledge — knowledge of the principle and knowledge of entailment — he is then called a noble disciple who is accomplished in view ... one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless."</p>
