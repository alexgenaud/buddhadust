					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ñātika in the Brick Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, he uttered this Dhamma exposition:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the ear and sounds ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging. ... Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as condition, craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt75" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.045.pali.bd.htm#pg75"><span class="f2">[75]</span></a> "In dependence on the ear and sounds ...</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a certain bhikkhu was standing listening in on the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saw him standing there listening in and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Did you hear that Dhamma exposition, bhikkhu?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Learn that Dhamma exposition, bhikkhu, master it and remember it.</p>

					<p class="f4">That Dhamma exposition is beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life."</p>
