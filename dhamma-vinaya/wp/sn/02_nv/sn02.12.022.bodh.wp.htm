<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Bodhi translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 3. Dasabala Vagga), Sutta 22. The Buddha states that it is because he has ten powers and is confident in four ways that he is able to teach about the components of existence, their arising and their ending and then adds an inspiring admonition to give up lazy ways and take on energy to accomplish the goal." />

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, possessing the ten powers and the four grounds of self-confidence, the Tathāgata claims the place of the chief bull of the herd, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is form ...</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(as in <a href="sn02.12.021.bodh.wp.htm">§21</a>)</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, the Dhamma has thus been well expounded by me, elucidated, disclosed, revealed, stripped of patchwork.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, bhikkhus, the Dhamma has thus been well expounded by me, elucidated, disclosed, revealed, stripped of patchwork, this is enough for a clansman who has gone forth out of faith to arouse his energy thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, by manly energy, by manly exertion.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt29" href="../../../pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.022.pali.bd.htm#pg29"><span class="f2">[29]</span></a> "Bhikkhus, the lazy person dwells in suffering, soiled by evil unwholesome states, and great is the personal good that he neglects.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the energetic person dwells happily, secluded from evil unwholesome states, and great is the personal good that he achieves.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not by the inferior that the supreme is attained; rather, it is by the supreme that the supreme is attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this holy life is a beverage of cream; the Teacher is present.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, arouse your energy for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, [with the thought]:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such a way this going forth of ours will not be barren, but fruitful and fertile; and when we use the robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites [offered to us by others], these services they provide for us will be of great fruit and benefit to them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Considering your own good, bhikkhus, it is enough to strive for the goal with diligence; considering the good of others, it is enough to strive for the goal with diligence; considering the good of both, it is enough to strive for the goal with diligence."</p>
