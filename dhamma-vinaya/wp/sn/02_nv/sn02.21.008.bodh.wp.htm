					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Nanda, the Blessed One's maternal cousin, put on well-pressed and well-ironed robes, painted his eyes, took a glazed bowl, and approached the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having paid homage to the Blessed One, he sat down to one side, and the Blessed One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nanda, this is not proper for you, a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, that you wear well-pressed and well-ironed robes, paint your eyes, and carry a glazed bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is proper for you, Nanda, a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, that you be a forest dweller, an almsfood eater, a rag-robes wearer, and that you dwell indifferent to sensual pleasures."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said ... [who] further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When shall I see Nanda as a forest dweller,<br />
							Wearing robes stitched from rags,<br />
							Subsisting on the scraps of strangers,<br />
							Indifferent towards sensual pleasures?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, some time later, the Venerable Nanda became a forest dweller, an almsfood eater, a rag-robes wearer, and he dwelt indifferent to sensual pleasures.</p>
