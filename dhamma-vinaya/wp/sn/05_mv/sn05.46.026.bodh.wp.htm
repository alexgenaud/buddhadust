					<p class="f4">And what is the path and the way that leads to the destruction of craving?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is: the seven factors of enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The enlightenment factor of mindfulness ... the enlightenment factor of equanimity."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī asked the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, how are the seven factors of enlightenment developed and cultivated so that they lead to the destruction of craving?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, Udāyī, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion ... without ill will, craving is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of craving, kamma is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of kamma, suffering is abandoned....</p>

					<p class="f4">"He develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion ... without ill will, craving is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of craving, kamma is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of kamma, suffering is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Udāyī, with the destruction of craving comes the destruction of kamma; with the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering."</p>
