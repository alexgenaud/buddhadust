					<p class="f4">On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling among the Cetiyans at Sahajāti.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion when the elder bhikkhus had returned from their alms round, after their meal they had assembled in the pavilion and were sitting together when this conversation arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, does one who sees suffering also see the origin of suffering, also see the cessation of suffering, also see the way leading to the cessation of suffering?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Gavampati said to the elder bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I have heard and learnt this:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, one who sees suffering also sees the origin of suffering, also sees the cessation of suffering, also sees the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who sees the origin of suffering also sees suffering, also sees the cessation of suffering, also sees the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who sees the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, also sees the origin of suffering, also sees the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who sees the way leading to the cessation of suffering also sees suffering, also sees the origin of suffering, also sees the cessation of suffering.'"</p>
