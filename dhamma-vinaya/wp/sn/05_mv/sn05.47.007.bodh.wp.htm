					<p class="f4">There, along the monkey trails, hunters set out traps of pitch for catching monkeys.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those monkeys who are not foolish and frivolous, when they see the pitch, avoid it from afar.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a monkey who is foolish and frivolous approaches the pitch and seizes it with his hand; he gets caught there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I will free my hand,' he seizes it with his other hand; he gets caught there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I will free both hands,' he seizes it with his foot; he gets caught there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I will free both hands and my foot,' he seizes it with his other foot; he gets caught there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I will free both hands and feet,' he applies his muzzle to it; he gets caught there.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, bhikkhus, that monkey, trapped at five points, lies there screeching.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has met with calamity and disaster and the hunter can do with him as he wishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">The hunter spears him, fastens him to that same block of wood, and goes off where he wants.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, bhikkhus, when one strays outside one's own resort into the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, do not stray outside your own resort into the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māra will gain access to those who stray outside their own resort into the domain of others; Māra will get a hold on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is not a bhikkhu's own resort but the domain of others? It is the five cords of sensual pleasure.... (/<a href="sn05.47.006.bodh.wp.htm">as above</a>/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what is not a bhikkhu's own resort but the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Move in your own resort, bhikkhus, in your own ancestral domain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māra will not gain access to those who move in their own resort, in their own ancestral domain; Māra will not get a hold on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is a bhikkhu's resort, his own ancestral domain?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the four establishments of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings ... mind in mind ... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a bhikkhu's resort, his own ancestral domain."</p>
