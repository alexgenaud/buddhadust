					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Sumbhas, where there was a town of the Sumbhas named Sedaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir!" the bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, suppose that on hearing, 'The most beautiful girl of the land! The most beautiful girl of the land!' a great crowd of people would assemble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that most beautiful girl of the land would dance exquisitely and sing exquisitely.</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing, 'The most beautiful girl of the land is dancing! The most beautiful girl of the land is singing!' an even larger crowd of people would assemble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man would come along, wishing to live, not wishing to die, wishing for happiness, averse to suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Someone would say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good man, you must carry around this bowl of oil filled to the brim between the crowd and the most beautiful girl of the land.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with a drawn sword will be following right behind you, and wherever you spill even a little of it, right there he will fell your head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, bhikkhus, would that man stop attending to that bowl of oil and out of negligence turn his attention outwards?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have made up this simile, bhikkhus, in order to convey a meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">This here is the meaning:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The bowl of oil filled to the brim': this is a designation for mindfulness directed to the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will develop and cultivate mindfulness directed to the body, make it our vehicle, make it our basis, stabilize it, exercise ourselves in it, and fully perfect it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves."</p>
