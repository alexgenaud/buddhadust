					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I wish to go into seclusion for three months.</p>

					<p class="f4">I should not be approached by anyone except the one who brings me almsfood."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied,<br />
					and no one approached the Blessed One except the one who brought him almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><b>[<a id="p326">326</a>]</b></span> Then, when those three months had passed,<br />
					the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects ask you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In what dwelling, friends,<br />
					did the Blessed One generally dwell<br />
					during the rains residence?'</p>

					<p class="f4">— being asked thus,<br />
					you should answer those wanderers thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'During the rains residence, friends,<br />
					the Blessed One generally dwelt in the concentration by mindfulness of breathing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, mindful I breathe in,<br />
					mindful I breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">When breathing in long I know:<br />
					'I breathe in long';<br />
					when breathing out long I know:<br />
					'I breathe out long.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When breathing in short I know:<br />
					'I breathe in short';<br />
					when breathing out short I know:<br />
					'I breathe out short.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I know: 'Experiencing the whole body I will breathe in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">...</p>

					<p class="f4">I know: 'Contemplating relinquishment,<br />
					I will breathe out.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn312" href="#n312">312</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"If anyone, bhikkhus, speaking rightly<br />
					could say of anything:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is a noble dwelling,<br />
					a divine dwelling,<br />
					the Tathāgata's dwelling,'</p>

					<p class="f4">it is of concentration by mindfulness of breathing that one could rightly say this.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who are trainees,<br />
					who have not attained their mind's ideal,<br />
					who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage:<br />
					for them concentration by mindfulness of breathing,<br />
					when developed and cultivated,<br />
					leads to the destruction of the taints.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those bhikkhus who are arahants,<br />
					whose taints are destroyed,<br />
					who have lived the holy life,<br />
					done what had to be done,<br />
					laid down the burden,<br />
					reached their own goal,<br />
					utterly destroyed the fetters of existence,<br />
					those completely liberated through final knowledge:<br />
					for them concentration by mindfulness of breathing,<br />
					when developed and cultivated,<br />
					leads to a pleasant dwelling in this very life<br />
					and to mindfulness and clear comprehension.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn313" href="#n313">313</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"If anyone, bhikkhus, speaking rightly<br />
					could say of anything:</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n312" href="#fn312">312</a>]</sup> In the Buddha's description of his own practice of mindfulness of breathing, <i>sato va</i> ("just mindful") is replaced by simple <i>sato,</i> and sikkhati ("he trains") is entirely dropped. Spk explains that va is omitted to show the exceptional peacefulness of his practice, since the in-breaths and out-breaths are always clear to him; <i>sikkhati</i> is omitted because he has no need to train himself.</p>
