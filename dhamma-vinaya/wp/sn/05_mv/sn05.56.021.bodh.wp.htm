					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Koṭigāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of <i>saŋsāra</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of <i>saŋsāra.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of not understanding and not penetrating the noble truth of the origin of suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the cessation of suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering that you and I have roamed and wandered through this long course of <i>saŋsāra.</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That noble truth of suffering, bhikkhus, has been understood and penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That noble truth of the origin of suffering has been understood and penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been understood and penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Because of not seeing as they are<br />
							The Four Noble Truths,<br />
							We have wandered through the long course<br />
							In the various kinds of births.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Now these truths have been seen;<br />
							The conduit to existence is severed;<br />
							Cut off is the root of suffering:<br />
							Now there is no more renewed existence."</p>
