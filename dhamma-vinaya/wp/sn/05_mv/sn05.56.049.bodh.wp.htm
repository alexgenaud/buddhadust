					<p class="f4">What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans that have been placed there or Sineru, the king of mountains?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, Sineru, the king of mountains, is more.</p>

					<p class="f4">The seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans are trifling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Compared to Sineru, the king of mountains, the seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans are not calculable, do not bear comparison, do not amount even to a fraction."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough, the suffering that has been utterly destroyed and eliminated is more, while that which remains is trifling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Compared to the former mass of suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated, the latter is not calculable, does not bear comparison, does not amount even to a fraction, as there is a maximum of seven more lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who understands as it really is: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>
