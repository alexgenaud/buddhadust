					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Udāyī approached the Blessed One ... and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is amazing, venerable sir, how helpful has been my devotion and reverence for the Blessed One, my sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing.</p>

					<p class="f4">For in the past, venerable sir, when I was still a householder, I did not have much concern for the Dhamma or the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I considered my devotion and reverence for the Blessed One, and my sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing, I went forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One taught me the Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling ... such is perception ... such are volitional formations ... such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, venerable sir, while I was staying in an empty hut following along with the surge and decline of the five aggregates subject to clinging, I directly knew as it really is: 'This is suffering'; I directly knew as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering'; I directly knew as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; I directly knew as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I have made the breakthrough to the Dhamma, venerable sir, and have obtained the path which, when I have developed and cultivated it, will lead me on, while I am dwelling in the appropriate way, to such a state that I shall understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have obtained the enlightenment factor of mindfulness which, when I have developed and cultivated it, will lead me on, while I am dwelling in the appropriate way, to such a state that I shall understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth ... there is no more for this state of being.'...</p>

					<p class="f4">I have obtained the enlightenment factor of equanimity which, when I have developed and cultivated it, will lead me on, while I am dwelling in the appropriate way, to such a state that I shall understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth ... there is no more for this state of being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, venerable sir, is the path that I have obtained, which ... will lead me on ... to such a state that I shall understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth ... there is no more for this state of being.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Udāyī!</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Udāyī, this is the path that you have obtained, and when you have developed and cultivated it, it will lead you on, while you are dwelling in the appropriate way, to such a state that you will understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.'"</p>
