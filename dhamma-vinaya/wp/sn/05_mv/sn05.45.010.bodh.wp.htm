					<p class="f4">"At Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Nandiya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How many things, Master Gotama, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbāna, have  Nibbāna as their destination, Nibbāna as their final goal?"</p>

					<p class="f4">These eight things, Nandiya, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbāna, have Nibbāna as their destination, Nibbāna as their final goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view ... right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">These eight things, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbāna have Nibbāna as their destination, Nibbāna as their final goal."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the wanderer Nandiya said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">... From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."</p>
