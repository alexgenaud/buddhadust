					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, this is the entire holy life, that is, good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the entire holy life, Sāriputta, that is, good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a bhikkhu has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Sāriputta, does a bhikkhu who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu develops right view, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops right intention ...</p>

					<p class="f4">right speech ...</p>

					<p class="f4">right action ...</p>

					<p class="f4">right livelihood ...</p>

					<p class="f4">right effort ...</p>

					<p class="f4">right mindfulness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">"By the following method too, Sāriputta, it may be understood how the entire holy life is good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship: by relying upon me as a good friend, Sāriputta, beings subject to birth are freed from birth; beings subject to aging are freed from aging; beings subject to death are freed from death; beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair are freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">By this method, Sāriputta, it may be understood how the entire holy life is good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship."</p>
