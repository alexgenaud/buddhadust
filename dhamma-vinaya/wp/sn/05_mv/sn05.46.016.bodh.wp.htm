					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sick, afflicted, gravely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Mahā Cunda, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Mahā Cunda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Recite the factors of enlightenment, Cunda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These seven factors of enlightenment, venerable sir, have been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The enlightenment factor of mindfulness has been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">...</p>

					<p class="f4">The enlightenment factor of equanimity has been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven factors of enlightenment, venerable sir, have been rightly expounded by the Blessed One; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment!"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Venerable Mahā Cunda said.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One recovered from that illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a way the Blessed One was cured of his illness.</p>
