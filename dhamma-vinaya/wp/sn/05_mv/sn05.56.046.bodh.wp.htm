					<p class="f4">When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That darkness, venerable sir, is indeed great; that darkness is indeed very great.</p>

					<p class="f4">But is there, venerable sir, any other darkness greater and more frightful than that one?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is, bhikkhu."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what, venerable sir, is that darkness greater and more frightful than that one?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those ascetics and brahmins, bhikkhu, who do not understand as it really is: 'This is suffering'; who do not understand as it really is: 'This is the origin of suffering'; who do not understand as it really is: 'This is the cessation of suffering'; who do not understand as it really is: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — they delight in volitional formations that lead to birth, in volitional formations that lead to aging, in volitional formations that lead to death, in volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting in such volitional formations, they generate volitional formations that lead to birth, generate volitional formations that lead to aging, generate volitional formations that lead to death, generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having generated such volitional formations, they tumble into the darkness of birth, tumble into the darkness of aging, tumble into the darkness of death, tumble into the darkness of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are not freed from birth, aging, and death; not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhikkhu, those ascetics and brahmins who understand as it really is: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — they do not delight in volitional formations that lead to birth, nor in volitional formations that lead to aging, nor in volitional formations that lead to death, nor in volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting in such volitional formations, they do not generate volitional formations that lead to birth, nor generate volitional formations that lead to aging, nor generate volitional formations that lead to death, nor generate volitional formations that lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not having generated such volitional formations, they do not tumble into the darkness of birth, nor tumble into the darkness of aging, nor tumble into the darkness of death, nor tumble into the darkness of sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are freed from birth, aging, and death; freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; freed from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhu an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>

					<p class="f4">An exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'"</p>
