					<p class="f4">"There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was dwelling at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā nder the Goatherd's Banyan Tree just after I became fully enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, while I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the one-way path for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation ... (/as in <a href="sn05.47.018.bodh.wp.htm">§18</a>/) ... that is, the four establishments of mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, bhikkhus, BrahmāSahampati, having known with his own mind the reflection in my mind, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, disappeared from the Brahmā world and reappeared before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">He arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, extended his joined hands towards me in reverential salutation, and said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So it is, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Fortunate One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, this is the one-way path for the purification of beings ... that is, the four establishments of mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, bhikkhus, is what Brahmā Sahampati said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, he further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"'The seer of the destruction of birth,<br />
							Compassionate, knows the one-way path<br />
							By which in the past they crossed the flood,<br />
							By which they will cross and cross over now.'"</p>
