					<p class="f4">Someone would say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good man, in the morning they will strike you with a hundred spears; at noon they will strike you with a hundred spears; in the evening they will strike you with a hundred spears.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you, good man, being struck day after day by three hundred spears will have a life span of a hundred years, will live a hundred years; and then, after a hundred years have passed, you will make the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths, to which you had not broken through earlier.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is fitting, bhikkhus, for a clansman intent on his good to accept the offer.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this <i>saŋsāra</i> without discoverable beginning; a first point cannot be discerned of blows by spears, blows by swords, blows by axes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And even though this may be so, bhikkhus, I do not say that the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths is accompanied by suffering or displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rather, the breakthrough to the Four Noble Truths is accompanied only by happiness and joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble truth of suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>

					<p class="f4">An exertion should be made to understand:</p>
