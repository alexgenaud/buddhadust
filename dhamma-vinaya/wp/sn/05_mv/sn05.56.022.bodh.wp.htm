					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Koṭigāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">who do not understand as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">who do not understand as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">who do not understand as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering':</p>

					<p class="f4">these I do not consider to be ascetics among ascetics or brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones do not, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, enter and dwell, in this very life, in the goal of asceticism or the goal of brahminhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand these things: these I consider to be ascetics among ascetics and brahmins among brahmins, and these venerable ones, by realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, enter and dwell, in this very life, in the goal of asceticism and the goal of brahminhood."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Those who do not understand suffering,<br />
							Who do not know suffering's origin,<br />
							Nor where suffering completely stops,<br />
							Where it ceases without remainder;<br />
							Who do not know that path<br />
							Which leads to suffering's appeasement:<br />
							They are devoid of mind's liberation<br />
							And also of liberation by wisdom;<br />
							Incapable of making an end,<br />
							They fare on to birth and aging.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"But those who understand suffering,<br />
							Who know too suffering's origin,<br />
							And where suffering completely stops,<br />
							Where it ceases without remainder;<br />
							Who understand that path<br />
							Which leads to suffering's appeasement:<br />
							They are endowed with mind's liberation<br />
							And also with liberation by wisdom;<br />
							Being capable of making an end,<br />
							They fare no more in birth and aging."</p>
