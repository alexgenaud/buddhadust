					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting in the open air in the midst of the Bhikkhu Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, having surveyed the silent Bhikkhu Saŋgha, addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, this assembly appears to me empty now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have attained final Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">This assembly was not empty for me [earlier], and I had no concern for whatever quarter Sāriputta and Moggallāna were dwelling in.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones, who arose in the past also had just such a supreme pair of disciples as I had in Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones, who will arise in the future will also have just such a supreme pair of disciples as I had in Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, bhikkhus, on the part of the disciples, it is amazing on the part of the disciples, that they will act in accordance with the Teacher's instructions and comply with his admonitions, that they will be dear and agreeable to the four assemblies, that they will be revered and esteemed by them.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, bhikkhus, on the part of the Tathāgath.it is amazing on the part of the Tathāgath that when such a pair of disciples has attained final Nibbāna,there is no sorrow or lamentation in the Tathāgath.</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, bhikkhus, is it to be obtained here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!'?</p>

					<p class="f4">That is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if the largest branches would break off a great tree standing possessed of heartwood: so too, bhikkhus, in the great Bhikkhu Saŋghastanding possessed of heartwood, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have attained final Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, bhikkhus, is it to be obtained here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May what is born, come to be, conditioned, and subject to disintegration not disintegrate!'?</p>

					<p class="f4">That is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge, with no other refuge; dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge ... <a href="sn05.47.009.bodh.wp.htm">(/as in §9/)</a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Those bhikkhus, either now or after I am gone, who dwell with themselves as their own island, with themselves as their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the Dhamma as their island, with the Dhamma as their refuge, with no other refuge — it is these bhikkhus who will be for me topmost of those keen on the training."</p>
