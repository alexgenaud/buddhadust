					<p class="f4">Then, while the quail was being carried off by the hawk, he lamented:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We were so unlucky, of so little merit!</p>

					<p class="f4">We strayed out of our own resort into the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">If we had stayed in our own resort today, in our own ancestral domain, this hawk wouldn't have stood a chance against me in a fight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what is your own resort, quail, what is your own ancestral domain?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The freshly ploughed field covered with clods of soil.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the hawk, confident of her own strength, not boasting of her own strength, released the quail, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go now, quail, but even there you won't escape me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, bhikkhus, the quail went to a freshly ploughed field covered with clods of soil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having climbed up on a large clod, he stood there and addressed the hawk:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come get me now, hawk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come get me now, hawk!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the hawk, confident of her own strength, not boasting of her own strength, folded up both her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the quail knew, 'That hawk has come close,' he slipped inside that clod, and the hawk shattered her breast right on the spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, bhikkhus, when one strays outside one's own resort into the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, do not stray outside your own resort into the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māra will gain access to those who stray outside their own resort into the domain of others; Māra will get a hold on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is not a bhikkhu's own resort but the domain of others?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the five cords of sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. Sounds cognizable by the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Odours cognizable by the nose ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognizable by the tongue ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Tactile objects cognizable by the body that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what is not a bhikkhu's own resort but the domain of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Move in your own resort, bhikkhus, in your own ancestral domain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māra will not gain access to those who move in their own resort, in their own ancestral domain; Māra will not get a hold on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is a bhikkhu's resort, his own ancestral domain?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the four establishments of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings ... mind in mind ... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a bhikkhu's resort, his own ancestral domain."</p>
