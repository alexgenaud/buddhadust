					<p class="f4">Having done so, he would impale the large creatures in the ocean on the large stakes, the middle-sized creatures on the middle-sized stakes, and the small creatures on the small stakes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still, bhikkhus, the gross creatures in the ocean would not be exhausted even after all the grass, sticks, branches, and foliage in Jambudīpa had been used up and exhausted.</p>

					<p class="f4">The small creatures in the ocean that could not easily be impaled on stakes would be even more numerous than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the minuteness of their bodies.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So vast, bhikkhus, is the plane of misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">The person who is accomplished in view, freed from that vast plane of misery, understands as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>
