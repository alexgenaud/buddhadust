					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, these four things are actual, unerring, not otherwise.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"'This is suffering': this, bhikkhus, is actual, unerring, not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of suffering': this is actual, unerring, not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of suffering': this is actual, unerring, not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering': this is actual, unerring, not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These four things, bhikkhus, are actual, unerring, not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhu, an exertion should be made to understand: 'This is suffering.' ... An exertion should be made to understand: 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="nn1" href="#nfn1">n1</a>]</sup> The reference points to a footnote to a comment to a statement explanining another statement in SN 2.12.20!  In this context we read: "With birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]': whether there is an arising of <i>Tathāgatas</i> or no arising of <i>Tathāgatas,</i> that element <i>[Ed.: dhatu, better as 'property' or 'characteristic']</i> still persists, the stableness of the Dhamma, the fixed course of the Dhamma, specific conditionality."<br />
					This paragraph goes on with the rest of the conditions and is footnoted thus (only partially quoted): That element <i>(sa dhātu)</i>, the intrinsic nature of the conditions <i>(paccayasabhāva)</i>, still persists; never is it the case that birth is not a condition for aging-and-death. ... Whether it is unpenetrated before and after the arising of <i>Tathāgatas,</i> or penetrated when they have arisen, that element still persists; it is not created by the Tathāgatas, but aging-and-death always occurs through birth as its condition. A Tathāgata simply discovers and proclaims this, but he does not invent it.<br />
					Then we read the paragraph to which our footnote refers: "Thus, bhikkhus, the actuality in this, the inerrancy, the not-otherwiseness, speecific conditionality: this is called dependent origination."<br />
					Then the footnote itself reads: "At 56:20, 27 the Four Noble Truths are said to be <i>tatha, avitatha, anaññatha</i> — the adjectives corresponding to the first three abstract nouns here. Spk gives a very specific interpretation (translated just below), though we might suspect the original sense was simply that the teaching of dependent origination is true, not false, and not other than real.<br />
					Spk: <i>(Actuality (tathatā)</i> is said to indicate the occurrence of each particular phenomenon when its assemblage of appropriate conditions is present. <i>Inerrancy (avitathatā)</i> means that once its conditions have reached completeness there is no nonoccurrence, even for a moment, of the phenomenon due to be produced from those conditions. <i>Not-otherwiseness (anaññathatā)</i> means that there is no production of one phenomenon by another's conditions. The phrase <i>specific conditionality</i>is used to refer to the (individual) conditions for aging-and-death, etc., or to the conditions taken as a group <i>(paccayasamūhato)</i>.</p>
