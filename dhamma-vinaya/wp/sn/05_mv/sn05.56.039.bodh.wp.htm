					<p class="f4">'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, a tuft of cotton wool or kapok, light, wafted by the wind, had settled on an even piece of ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">An easterly wind would drive it westward; a westerly wind would drive it eastward; a northerly wind would drive it southward; a southerly wind would drive it northward.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the lightness of the tuft.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was an iron pillar or an Indra's pillar with a deep base, securely planted, immobile, unshaking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if a forceful blast of wind comes — whether from the east, the west, the north, or the south — that pillar would not shake, quake, or tremble.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the pillar has a deep base and is securely planted.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, bhikkhus, they have clearly seen the Four Noble Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble truth of suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>

					<p class="f4">An exertion should be made to understand:</p>
