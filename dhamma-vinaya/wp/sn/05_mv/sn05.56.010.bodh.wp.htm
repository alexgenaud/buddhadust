					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, do not engage in the various kinds of pointless talk, that is, talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state; talk about armies, dangers, and wars; talk about food, drink, garments, and beds; talk about garlands and scents; talk about relations, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and talk about heroes; street talk and talk by the well; talk about those departed in days gone by; rambling chitchat; speculation about the world and about the sea; talk about becoming this or that.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, bhikkhus, this talk is unbeneficial, irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and does not lead to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When you talk, bhikkhus, you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, bhikkhus, this talk is beneficial, relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and leads to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>
