					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brahmin approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, what is the cause and reason why the true Dhamma does not endure long after a Tathāgata has attained final Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the cause and reason why the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathāgatahas attained final Nibbāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, brahmin, because the four establishments of mindfulness are not developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma does not endure long after a Tathāgata has attained final Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is because the four establishments of mindfulness are developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathāgatahas attained final Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">... <a href="sn05.47.022.bodh.wp.htm">(/as in §22/)</a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because these four establishments of mindfulness are not developed and cultivated ... are developed and cultivated that the true Dhamma endures long after a Tathāgata has attained final Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, that brahmin said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">... From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."</p>
