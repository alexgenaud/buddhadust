					<p class="f4">When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, I remember the Four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, bhikkhu, do you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I remember suffering, venerable sir, as the first noble truth taught by the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if any ascetic or brahmin should speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not the first noble truth of suffering taught by the ascetic Gotama; having rejected this first noble truth of suffering, I will make known another first noble truth of suffering' — this is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I remember the origin of suffering as the second noble truth taught by the Blessed One....</p>

					<p class="f4">I remember the cessation of suffering as the third noble truth taught by the Blessed One....</p>

					<p class="f4">I remember the way leading to the cessation of suffering as the fourth noble truth taught by the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if any ascetic or brahmin should speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not the fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering taught by the ascetic Gotama; having rejected this fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering, I will make known another fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — this is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in this way, venerable sir, that I remember the Four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, bhikkhu!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good that you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suffering, bhikkhu, is the first noble truth taught by me: remember it thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if any ascetic or brahmin should speak thus ... (/as above/) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not the fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering taught by the ascetic Gotama; having rejected this fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering, I will make known another fourth noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering' — this is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this way, bhikkhu, remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me. </p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhu, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>

					<p class="f4">An exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering."</p>
