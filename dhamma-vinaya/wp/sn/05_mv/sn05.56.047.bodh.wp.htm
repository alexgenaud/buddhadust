					<p class="f4">What do you think, bhikkhus, would that blind turtle, coming to the surface once every hundred years, insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it would ever do so, venerable sir, it would be only after a very long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sooner, I say, would that blind turtle, coming to the surface once every hundred years, insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole than the fool who has gone once to the nether world [would regain] the human state.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because here, bhikkhus, there is no conduct guided by the Dhamma, no righteous conduct, no wholesome activity, no meritorious activity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here there prevails mutual devouring, the devouring of the weak.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, bhikkhus, they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble truth of suffering ... the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>
