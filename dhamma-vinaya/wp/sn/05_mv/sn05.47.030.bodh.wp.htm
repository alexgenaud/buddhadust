					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the householder Mānadiṇṇa was sick, afflicted, gravely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder Mānadiṇṇa addressed a man thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, good man, approach the Venerable Ānanda, pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet, and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, the householder Mānadiṇṇa is sick, afflicted, gravely ill; he pays homage to the Venerable Ānanda with his head at his feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It would be good, venerable sir, if the Venerable Ānanda would come to the residence of the householder Mānadiṇṇa out of compassion.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, master," that man replied, and he approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and delivered his message.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Ānandaconsented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the residence of the householder Mānadiṇṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then sat down in the appointed seat and said to the householder Mānadiṇṇa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope you are bearing up, householder, I hope you are getting better.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not bearing up, venerable sir, I am not getting better.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, venerable sir, when I am being touched by such painful feeling, I dwell contemplating the body in the body ... feelings in feelings ... mind in mind ... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as to these five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I do not see any of these unabandoned in myself."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a gain for you, householder!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is well gained by you, householder!</p>

					<p class="f4">You have declared, householder, the fruit of nonreturning."</p>
