The bhikkhus are urged to abandon acrimonious debate and in stead to train themselves to think about and speak with one another about the topics: 'this is pain', 'this is the source of pain', 'this is way to end pain,' 'this is the way to go about bringing an end to pain.'" />

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, do not engage in disputatious talk, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You don't understand this Dhamma and Discipline. I understand this Dhamma and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, you understand this Dhamma and Discipline!</p>

					<p class="f4">You're practising wrongly, I'm practising rightly.</p>

					<p class="f4">What should have been said before you said after; what should have been said after you said before.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm consistent, you're inconsistent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you took so long to think out has been overturned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your thesis has been refuted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go off to rescue your thesis, for you're defeated, or disentangle yourself if you can.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, bhikkhus, this talk is unbeneficial, irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and does not lead to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When you talk, bhikkhus, you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of suffering';</p>

					<p class="f4">you should talk about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, bhikkhus, this talk is beneficial, relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and leads to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>
