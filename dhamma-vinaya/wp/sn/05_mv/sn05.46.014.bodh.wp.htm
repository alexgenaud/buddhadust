					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahā Kassapa was dwelling in the Pipphali Cave — sick, afflicted, gravely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and approached the Venerable Mahākassapa</p>

					<p class="f4">e sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Mahā Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope you are bearing up, Kassapa, I hope you are getting better.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, I am not bearing up, I am not getting better.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These seven factors of enlightenment, Kassapa, have been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The enlightenment factor of mindfulness has been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The enlightenment factor of equanimity has been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, it leads to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven factors of enlightenment, Kassapa, have been rightly expounded by me; when developed and cultivated, they lead to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, Blessed One, they are factors of enlightenment!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, Fortunate One, they are factors of enlightenment!"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Elated, the Venerable Mahā Kassapa delighted in the Blessed One's statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Venerable Mahā Kassapa recovered from that illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a way the Venerable Mahā Kassapa was cured of his illness.</p>
