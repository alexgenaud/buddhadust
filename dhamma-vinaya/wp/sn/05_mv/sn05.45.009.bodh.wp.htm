					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the spike is wrongly directed.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu with a wrongly directed view, with a wrongly directed development of the path, could pierce ignorance, arouse true knowledge, and realize <i>Nibbāna</i> this is impossible. </p>
