					<p class="f4">"At Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I wish to go into seclusion for half a month.</p>

					<p class="f4">I should not be approached by anyone except the one who brings me almsfood."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," those bhikkhus replied, and no one approached the Blessed One except the one who brought him almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when that half-month had passed, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, I have been dwelling in part of the abode in which I dwelt just after I became fully enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have understood thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is feeling with wrong view as condition, also feeling with right view as condition....</p>

					<p class="f4">There is feeling with wrong concentration as condition, also feeling with right concentration as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is feeling with desire as condition, also feeling with thought as condition, also feeling with perception as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'When desire has not subsided, and thought has not subsided, and perception has not subsided, there is feeling with that as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">[When desire has subsided, and thoughts have not subsided, and perceptions have not subsided, there is also feeling with that as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">When desire has subsided, and thoughts have subsided, and perceptions have not subsided, there is also feeling with that as condition.]</p>

					<p class="f4">When desire has subsided, and thought has subsided, and perception has subsided, there is also feeling with that as condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that stage has been reached, there is also feeling with that as condition."</p>
