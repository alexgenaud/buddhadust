					<p class="f4">At Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One....|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Sitting to one side, those bhikkhus said to the Blessed One:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, venerable sir, wanderers of other sects ask us:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'For what purpose, friends, is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama?'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">When we are asked thus, venerable sir, we answer those wanderers thus:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is, friends, for the full understanding of suffering that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">We hope, venerable sir, that when we answer thus we state what has been said by the Blessed One and do not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact; that we explain in accordance with the Dhamma, and that no reasonable consequence of our assertion gives ground for criticism."|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, bhikkhus, when you answer thus you state what has been said by me and do not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact; you explain in accordance with the Dhamma, and no reasonable consequence of your assertion gives ground for criticism.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">For, bhikkhus, it is for the full understanding of suffering that the holy life is lived under me.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects ask you:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, friends, is there a path, is there a way for the full understanding of this suffering?' —|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">being asked thus, you should answer them thus:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is a path, friends, there is a way for the full understanding of this suffering.'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is that path, what is that way for the full understanding of this suffering?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view ... right concentration.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the path, this is the way for the full understanding of this suffering.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"Being asked thus, bhikkhus, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in such a way."</p>
