					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, once in the past an acrobat set up his bamboo pole and addressed his apprentice Medakathālikā thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, dear Medakathālikā, climb the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having replied, 'Yes, teacher,' the apprentice Medakathālikā climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on the teacher's shoulders.</p>

					<p class="f4">The acrobat then said to the apprentice Medakathālikā:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You protect me, dear Medakathālikā, and I'll protect you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus guarded by one another, protected by one another, we'll display our skills, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the apprentice Medakathālikā replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's not the way to do it, teacher.</p>

					<p class="f4">You protect yourself, teacher, and I'll protect myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, each self-guarded and self-protected, we'll display our skills, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the method there," the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's just as the apprentice Medakathālikā said to the teacher.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will protect myself,' bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will protect others,' bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">Protecting oneself, bhikkhus, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is it, bhikkhus, that by protecting oneself one protects others?</p>

					<p class="f4">By the pursuit, development, and cultivation [of the four establishments of mindfulness].</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way that by protecting oneself one protects others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is it, bhikkhus, that by protecting others one protects oneself?</p>

					<p class="f4">By patience, harmlessness, lovingkindness, and sympathy.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in such a way that by protecting others one protects oneself.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I will protect myself,' bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will protect others,' bhikkhus: thus should the establishments of mindfulness be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">Protecting oneself, bhikkhus, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself."</p>
