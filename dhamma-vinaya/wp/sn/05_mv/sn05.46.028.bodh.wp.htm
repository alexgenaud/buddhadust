					<p class="f4">Listen to that.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, is the path that partakes of penetration?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is: the seven factors of enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The enlightenment factor of mindfulness ... the enlightenment factor of equanimity."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī asked the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, how are the seven factors of enlightenment developed and cultivated so that they lead to penetration?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Udāyī a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">With a mind that has developed the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, he penetrates and sunders the mass of greed that he has never before penetrated and sundered; he penetrates and sunders the mass of hatred that he has never before penetrated and sundered; he penetrates and sunders the mass of delusion that he has never before penetrated and sundered. ...</p>
