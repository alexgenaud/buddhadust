Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Venerable Lomasavaŋgīsa, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it the case, venerable sir, that the dwelling of a trainee is itself the same as the Tathagata's dwelling, or is it rather that the dwelling of a trainee is one thing and the Tathagata's dwelling is another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not the case, friend Mahānāma, that the dwelling of a trainee is itself the same as the Tathagata's dwelling; rather, the dwelling of a trainee is one thing and the Tathagata's dwelling is another.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Mahānāma, those bhikkhus who are trainees, who have not attained their mind's ideal, who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage, dwell having abandoned the five hindrances.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn314" href="#n314">314</a>]</sup></span> What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. Those bhikkhus who are trainees ... dwell having abandoned these five hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend Mahānāma, for those bhikkhus who are arahants, whose taints are destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, become completely liberated through final knowledge, the five hindrances have been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like palm stumps, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn315" href="#n315">315</a>]</sup></span> What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. <span class="f3"><b>[<a id="p328">328</a>]</b></span> For those bhikkhus who are arahants ... these five hindrances have been abandoned, cut off at the root, made like palm stumps, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"By the following method too, friend Mahānāma, it can be understood how the dwelling of a trainee is one thing and the Tathagata's dwelling is another.</p>

					<p class="f4">"On this one occasion, friend Mahānāma, the Blessed One was dwelling at Icchānaŋgala in the Icchānaŋgala Wood. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: 'Bhikkhus, I wish to go into seclusion for three months. I should not be approached by anyone except the one who brings me almsfood.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(He here repeats the entire contents of the preceding sutta, down to:)</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"'If anyone, bhikkhus, speaking rightly could say of anything: "It is a noble dwelling, a divine dwelling, the Tathagata's dwelling," it is of concentration by mindfulness of breathing that one could rightly say this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"By this method, friend Mahānāma, it can be understood how the dwelling of a trainee is one thing and the Tathagata's dwelling is another."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n314" href="#fn314">314</a>]</sup><i>Te ime pañka nīvaraṇe pahāya viharanti.</i> All trainees have completely abandoned the hindrance of doubt; non-retumers have, in addition, eradicated ill will and remorse (as well as sensual desire in its more restricted sense). Trainees abandon the other hindrances only temporarily through jhāna and insight; see n. 7 on the five kinds of seclusion. The absolutive <i>pahāya</i> here should be construed in the light of these qualifications.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n315" href="#fn315">315</a>]</sup><i>Tesaɱ pañca nīvaraṇā pahinā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvakatā āyatiɱ anuppādadhammā.</i> This emphasizes the final and complete abandonment of the five hindrances.</p>
