					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, if one were to say of anything 'a heap of the unwholesome,' it is about the five hindrances that one could rightly say this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is a complete heap of the unwholesome, that is, the five hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth and torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, the hindrance of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one were to say of anything 'a heap of the unwholesome,' it is about these five hindrances that one could rightly say this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is a complete heap of the unwholesome, that is, the five hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, bhikkhus, one were to say of anything 'a heap of the wholesome,' it is about the four establishments of mindfulness that one could rightly say this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is a complete heap of the wholesome, that is, the four establishments of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings ... mind in mind ... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one were to say of anything 'a heap of the wholesome,' it is about these four establishments of mindfulness that one could rightly say this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is a complete heap of the wholesome, that is, the four establishments of mindfulness."</p>
