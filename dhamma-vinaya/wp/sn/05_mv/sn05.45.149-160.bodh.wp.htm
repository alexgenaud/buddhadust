					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, suppose there is a guest house.</p>

					<p class="f4">People come from the east, west, north, and south and lodge there; khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas come and lodge there.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, he fully understands by direct knowledge those things that are to be fully understood by direct knowledge; he abandons by direct knowledge those things that are to be abandoned by direct knowledge; he realizes by direct knowledge those things that are to be realized by direct knowledge; he develops by direct knowledge those things that are to be developed by direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be fully understood by direct knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: the five aggregates subject to clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The form aggregate subject to clinging ... the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the things to be fully understood by direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be abandoned by direct knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance and craving for existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the things to be abandoned by direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be realized by direct knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">True knowledge and liberation.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the things to be realized by direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be developed by direct knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Serenity and insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the things to be developed by direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is it, bhikkhus, that when a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path, he fully understands by direct knowledge those things that are to be fully understood by direct knowledge ... he develops by direct knowledge those things that are to be developed by direct knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path so that he fully understands by direct knowledge those things that are to be fully understood by direct knowledge ... he develops by direct knowledge those things that are to be developed by direct knowledge."</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">(ii) Removal of Lust Version</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion...."</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">(iii) The Deathless As Its Ground Version</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which has the Deathless as its ground, the Deathless as its destination, the Deathless as its final goal...."</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">(iv) Slants Towards Nibbāna Version</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna..."</p>

					<h1>The River</h1>

					<h4 class="ctr">i. Based upon Seclusion Version</h4>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p160.1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.149-160.pali.bd.htm#p160.1">160.1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.149-160.wood.pts.htm#p160.1">pts</a>]</span> At Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, that when the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, a great crowd of people would come along bringing a shovel and a basket, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will make this river Ganges slant, slope, and incline towards the west.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, bhikkhus, would that great crowd of people be able to make the river Ganges slant, slope, and incline towards the west?"</p>

					<p class="f4">No, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, and it is not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline towards the west.</p>

					<p class="f4">That great crowd of people would only reap fatigue and vexation."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is developing and cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, kings or royal ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or kinsmen, might invite him to accept wealth, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good man, why let these saffron robes weigh you down?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why roam around with a shaven head and a begging bowl?</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, having returned to the lower life, enjoy wealth and do meritorious deeds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, bhikkhus, when that bhikkhu is developing and cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path, it is impossible that he will give up the training and return to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because for a long time his mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined towards seclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is impossible that he will return to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path."</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">(iv) Slants Towards Nibbāna Version</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view ... right concentration, which slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna..."</p>
