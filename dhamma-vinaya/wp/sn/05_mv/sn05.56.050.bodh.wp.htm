					<p class="f4">What do you think, bhikkhus, which is more: the portion of Sineru, the king of mountains, that has been destroyed and eliminated or the seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans that remain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, the portion of Sineru, the king of mountains, that has been destroyed and eliminated is more.</p>

					<p class="f4">The seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans that remain are trifling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Compared to the portion of Sineru that would be destroyed and eliminated, the seven grains of gravel the size of mung beans that remain are not calculable, do not bear comparison, do not amount even to a fraction."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view who has made the breakthrough, the suffering that has been utterly destroyed and eliminated is more, while that which remains is trifling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Compared to the former mass of suffering that has been destroyed and eliminated, the latter is not calculable, does not bear comparison, does not amount even to a fraction, as there is a maximum of seven more lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who understands as it really is: 'This is suffering' ... 'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus an exertion should be made to understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering.'...</p>
