					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup><i>Mārisa,</i> "dear sir," is the term which the devas generally use to address the Buddha, eminent bhikkhus (see, e.g., 40:10; IV 270, 16), and members of their own community (11:3; I 218, 34); kings also use it to address one another (3:12; I 80, 4). Spk explains it as a term of affection meaning "one without suffering" (<i>niddukkha</i>), but it is probably a Middle Indic form of Skt <i>mad.rsa</i>.<br />
					The word "flood" (<i>ogha</i>) is used metaphorically, but here with technical overtones, to designate a doctrinal set of four floods (see 45:171), so called, according to Spk, "because they keep beings submerged within the round of existence and do not allow them to rise up to higher states and to Nibbāna." The four (with definitions from Spk) are: (i) the flood of sensuality (<i>kāmogha</i>) = desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure (agreeable forms, sounds, etc.-see 45:176); (ii) the flood of existence (<i>bhavogha</i>) = desire and lust for form-sphere existence and formless-sphere existence and attachment to jhāna; (iii) the flood of views (<i>ditthogha</i>) = the sixty-two views (DN I 12-38); and (iv) the flood of ignorance (<i>avijjogha</i>) = lack of knowledge regarding the Four Noble Truths. Flood imagery is also used at vv. 298-300, 511-13, and 848-49.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup><i>Appatiṭṭhaɱ khvāhaɱ āvuso anāyūhaɱ ogham atariɱ.</i> Spk: The Buddha's reply is intended to be paradoxical, for one normally crosses a flood by halting in places that offer a foothold and by straining in places that must be crossed.<br />
					Spk glosses <i>appatiṭṭhaɱ</i> only with <i>appatiṭṭhahanto</i> (an alternative form of the present participle), but Spk-pṭ elaborates: "<i>Not halting:</i> not coming to a standstill on account of the defilements and so forth; the meaning is 'not sinking' <i>(appatiṭṭhahanto ti kilesādinaɱ vasena asantiṭṭhanto, asaŋsīdanto ti attho)</i>." The verb <i>patitiṭṭhati</i> usually means "to become established," i.e., attached, principally on account of craving and other defilements: see below v. 46 and n. 35. Consciousness driven by craving is "established" (see 12:38-40, 12:64, 22:53-54), and when craving is removed it becomes "unestablished, unsupported." The arahant expires "with consciousness unestablished" (<i>appatiṭṭhitena viññāṇena ... parinibbuto;</i> see 4:23 (I 122,12-13)). All these nuances resonate in the Buddha's reply.<br />
					The verb <i>āyūhati</i> is rare in the Nikāyas, but see below v. 263df, v. 264d, and Sn 210d. It is an intensification of <i>ūhati</i> (augmented by <i>ā</i>- with -<i>y</i>- as liaison); the simple verb occurs at MN I 116,13-14, where it might be rendered "to be strained." Its occurrence there ties up with the present context: a strained mind is far from concentration. In the later literature the noun form <i>āyūhana</i> acquires the technical sense of "accumulation," with specific reference to kamma; in the formula of dependent origination (<i>paṭiccasamuppāda</i>), volitional formations (<i>saŋkhārā</i>) are said to have the function of <i>āyūhana;</i> see Paṭis I 52,14, 26; Vism 528,12 (Ppn 17:51), 579,31-580,4 (Ppn 17:292-93).<br />
					Spk: The Blessed One deliberately gave an obscure reply to the deva in order to humble him, for he was stiff with conceit yet imagined himself wise. Realizing that the deva would not be able to penetrate the teaching unless he first changed his attitude, the Buddha intended to perplex him and thereby curb his pride. At that point, humbled, the deva would ask for clarification and the Buddha would explain in such a way that he could understand.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>The Buddha's brief reply points to the middle way (<i>majjhimā paṭipadā</i>) in its most comprehensive range, both practical and philosophical. To make this implication clear Spk enumerates seven dyads: (i) "halting" by way of defilements, one sinks; "straining" by way of volitional formations, one gets swept away; (ii) by way of craving and views, one sinks; by way of the other defilements, one gets swept away; (iii) by way of craving, one sinks; by way of views, one gets swept away; (iv) by way of the eternalist view, one sinks; by way of the annihilationist view, one gets swept away (see It 43,12-44,4); (v) by way of slackness one sinks, by way of restlessness one gets swept away; (vi) by way of devotion to sensual pleasures one sinks, by way of devotion to self-mortification one gets swept away; (vii) by way of all unwholesome volitional formations one sinks, by way of all mundane wholesome volitional formations one gets swept away. Ñāṇananda suggests connecting the principle of "not halting, not straining" with each of the four floods: see SN-Anth 2:56-58.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup>Spk: The Buddha is called a <i>brahmin</i> in the sense of arahant (see Dhp 388, 396-423). He is <i>fully quenched</i> (<i>parinibbuto</i>) in that he is quenched through the quenching of defilements (<i>kilesanibbānena nibbutaɱ</i>). Craving is designated <i>attachment</i> (<i>visattikā</i>) because it clings and adheres to a variety of sense objects.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup>Spk: When the deva heard the Buddha's reply he was established in the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
