					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, once in the past the asuras marched against the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed  Suvīra, a young deva, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Dear Suvīra, these asuras are marching against the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go, dear Suvīra, launch a counter-march against the asuras.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, your lordship,' Suvīra replied, but he became negligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Sakka addressed Suvīra ...  ... but a second time Suvīra became negligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Sakka addressed Suvīra ... but a third time Suvīra became negligent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt217" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.11.001-025.pali.bd.htm#pg217"><span class="f2">[217]</span></a> Then, bhikkhus, Sakka addressed  Suvīra in verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v858"><span class="f2 c"><b>[858]</b></span></a> "'Where one need not toil and strive<br />
							Yet still may attain to bliss:<br />

					<p class="f4">[Suvīra:]</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v859"><span class="f2 c"><b>[859]</b></span></a> "'That a lazy man who does not toil<br />

							Might still have all desires fulfilled:<br />

					<p class="f4">[Sakka:]</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v860"><span class="f2 c"><b>[860]</b></span></a> "'Where a lazy man who does not toil<br />

							Go there,  Suvīra,<br />

					<p class="f4">[Suvīra:]</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v861"><span class="f2 c"><b>[861]</b></span></a> "'The bliss, supreme deva, we might find<br />
							Without doing work, O Sakka,<br />

					<p class="f4">[Sakka:]</p>

							That is indeed Nibbāna's path:<br />
							Go there, Suvīra,<br />
							And take me along with you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, bhikkhus, if Sakka, lord of the devas, subsisting on the fruit of his own merit, exercising supreme sovereignty and rulership over the Tavatiɱsa devas, will be one who speaks in praise of initiative and energy, then how much more would it be fitting here for you, who have gone forth in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline, to toil, struggle, and strive for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained, for the achievement of the as-yet-unachieved, for the realization of the as-yet-unrealized."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'If you cannot look up at the crest of my standard, then you should look up at the crest of the deva-king Pajāpati's standard.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because Sakka, lord of the devas, is not devoid of lust, not devoid of hatred, not devoid of delusion; he can be timid, petrified, frightened, quick to flee.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhikkhus, I say this:</p>

					<p class="f4">If you have gone to a forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty hut, and fear or trepidation or terror should arise in you, on that occasion you should recollect me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For when you recollect the Dhamma, bhikkhus, whatever fear or trepidation or terror you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If you cannot recollect the Dhamma, then you should recollect the Saŋghathus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Saŋghaof the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way,  practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals — this Saŋghaof the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion two bhikkhus had a quarrel and one bhikkhu had transgressed against the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the former bhikkhu confessed his transgression to the other bhikkhu, but the latter would not pardon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to him what had happened.</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Blessed One said:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, there are two kinds of fools: one who does not see a transgression as a transgression; and one who, when another is confessing a transgression, does not pardon him in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two kinds of fools.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, bhikkhus, two kinds of wise people: one who sees a transgression as a transgression; and one who, when another is confessing a transgression, pardons him in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two kinds of wise people.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once in the past, bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, instructing the Tavatiɱsa devas in the Sudhamma assembly hall, on that occasion recited this verse: <a id="pt240" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.11.001-025.pali.bd.htm#pg240"><span class="f2">[240]</span></a></p>

							Anger crushes evil people.'"</p>
