					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Samiddhi, having risen at the first flush of dawn, went to the hot springs to bathe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having bathed in the hot springs and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night had advanced, a certain devatā of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire hot springs, approached the Venerable Samiddhi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that devatā alighted on the earth and said to the Venerable Samiddhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You have gone forth while young, bhikkhu, a lad with black hair, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, without having dallied with sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enjoy human sensual pleasures, bhikkhu; do not abandon what is directly visible in order to pursue what takes time."</p>

					<p class="f4">I have abandoned what takes time in order to pursue what is directly visible.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the Blessed One, friend, has stated that sensual pleasures are time-consuming, full of suffering, full of despair, and the danger in them is still greater, while this Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how is it, bhikkhu, that the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures are time-consuming, full of suffering, full of despair, and the danger in them is still greater?</p>

					<p class="f4">But that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is dwelling at Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Approach that Blessed One and ask him about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he explains it to you, so you should remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It isn't easy for us to approach that Blessed One, bhikkhu, as he is surrounded by other devatās of great influence.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would approach him and ask him about this matter, we will come along too in order to hear the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friend," the Venerable Samiddhi replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, <a id="pt10" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.011-020.pali.bd.htm#pg10"><span class="f2">[10]</span></a> and reported his entire discussion with that devatā,</p>

							He cut off craving here for name-and-form.<br />

							Here and beyond, in the heavens and all abodes,<br />
							They do not find the one whose knots are cut,<br />

							Not by speech, mind, or body.<br />
							Having abandoned sense pleasures,<br />
							Mindful and clearly comprehending,<br />
							One should not pursue a course<br />
							That is painful and harmful."</p>
