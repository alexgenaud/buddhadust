					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters — Taṇhā, Aratī, and Ragā — approached the Blessed One and said to him: "We serve at your feet, ascetic."

Then Māra's three daughters, each manifesting herself in the form of a hundred women who have never given birth ... in the form of a hundred women who have given birth once ... in the form of a hundred women who have given birth twice ... in the form of a hundred women of middle age ... in the form of a hundred old women, approached the Blessed One and said to him: "We serve at your feet, ascetic." But the Blessed One paid no attention, as he was liberated in the unsurpassed extinction of acquisitions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters — Taṇhā, Aratī, and Ragā — went off to the side and said: "What our father told us is true:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Arahant, the Fortunate One in the world ...<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters — Taṇhā, Aratī, and Ragā — approached the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Māra's daughter Taṇhā addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n260" href="#fn260">260</a>]</sup> Spk assigns this sutta to the first week after the Buddha's enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n261" href="#fn261">261</a>]</sup> I translate the last sentence in accordance with the reading of Se and Eel and 2: <i>sādhu thito sato bodhiɱ samajjhagaɱ.</i> Be reads: <i>sādhu vatamhi mutto bodhiɱ samajjhagaɱ.</i> By <i>gruelling asceticism</i> (<i>dukkarakārikā</i>) the Buddha refers to the rigorous austerities he practised for six years before he discovered the "middle way" to enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n262" href="#fn262">262</a>]</sup> There is a delicate irony here in Māra the Tempter, usually the suave proponent of sensual indulgence, now recommending strict asceticism. This confirms the old maxim that the extremes are actually closer to each other than either is to the mean. I read pāda d with Se and Eel as <i>suddhimaggam aparaddho</i> as against Be and Ee2 <i>suddhimaggā aparaddho</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n263" href="#fn263">263</a>]</sup> I read with Be and Se <i>amaraɱ tapaɱ,</i> as against Eel and 2 <i>aparaɱ tapaɱ</i>. The expression, a split compound, occurs also at Th 219d. See CPD, s.v. <i>amaratapa</i>. Spk: Low austerity practised for the sake of immortality (<i>amarabhāvatthāya kataɱ lukhatapaɱ</i>); that is, devotion to self-mortification (<i>attakilamathānuyogo</i>). Spk-pt: For the most part one is devoted to the practice of bodily mortification for the sake of immortality, and when that is pursued by those who accept kamma it may be for the sake of becoming a deva (believed to be immortal). See too Sn 249d.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n264" href="#fn264">264</a>]</sup> <i>Piyārittaɱ va dhammani.</i> Spk: <i>Araññe thale piyārittaɱ viya;</i> "like oars and rudder on high forest ground." Spk-pt:

					<i>Dhammaɱ vuccati vaṇṇu; so idha dhamman ti vuttalɱ. Dhammani vaṇṇupadese ti attho;</i> "It is sand that is called '<i>dhammaɱ</i>'; that is what is meant here by 'dhammaɱ.' The meaning is: in a sandy place." PED lists <i>darmmani</i> but does not explain the derivation; but see MW, s.v. <i>dhanvan,</i> where the meanings given include dry soil, shore, desert.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Spk: "This is meant: If a ship were placed on high ground, and were loaded with merchandise, and the crew would board it, take hold of the oars and rudder, and pull and push with all their might, for all their effort they would not be able to advance the ship even one or two inches; the effort would be useless, futile. So, having known austerities thus, I rejected them as futile. "</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n265" href="#fn265">265</a>]</sup> Virtue, concentration, and wisdom are the three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path: virtue (<i>sīla</i>) includes right speech, action, and livelihood; concentration (<i>samādhi</i>), right effort, mindfulness, and concentration; and wisdom (<i>paññā</i>), right view and right intention. Māra is called the End-maker (<i>antaka</i>) because he binds beings to death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n266" href="#fn266">266</a>]</sup> <i>Devo ca ekam ekaɱ phusāyati.</i> I understand this idiom (which recurs at 6:13 and 7:22) to mean that rain was falling drop by drop, not that it was falling continuously (the meaning ascribed to it by CPO). It would hardly seem sensible for the Buddha to sit out in the open if rain was falling heavily.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Spk: He was sitting there reviewing his practice of striving in order to provide a model for clansmen in the future, who would strive in emulation of the Teacher.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n267" href="#fn267">267</a>]</sup> In pāda a we should read with Be, Se, and Ee2 <i>saɱsaraɱ</i> rather than Eel <i>saɱsāraɱ</i>. The "long course" (<i>dīgham addhānaɱ</i>) is <i>saɱsāra.</i> Spk: It is said that there is no form that Māra had not previously assumed in order to frighten the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n268" href="#fn268">268</a>]</sup> <i>Na te mārassa paddhagū</i>. The last word is read here as in Ee2 and Sn 1095. Be and Se have <i>baddhagū,</i> Eel <i>paccagū</i>. PED conjectures that paddhagu may represent Skt "<i>*prādhvaga,</i> "those who accompany one on a journey," that is, one's servants. Spk glosses: "They do not become your disciples, pupils, apprentices" (<i>baddhacarā sissā antevāsikā na honti</i>). The word baddhacara [Spk-pt: = <i>paṭibaddhacariya</i>] occurs at v. 578a.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n269" href="#fn269">269</a>]</sup> This discourse is also at Vin I 22,24-36, set soon after the Buddha's first rains residence at the Deer Park in Isipatana. The Buddha had already sent out his first sixty arahant disciples to spread the Dhamma. The present admonition, it seems, is addressed to the newly ordained bhikkhus who had come to the Buddha in response to the missionary work of the first disciples.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n270" href="#fn270">270</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Careful attention</i> (<i>yoniso manasikāra</i>) is attention that is the right means (<i>upāyamanasikāra</i>). <i>Careful right striving</i> (<i>yoniso sammappadhāna</i>) is energy that is the right means, energy that is the causal basis (<i>upāyaviriya kāraṇaviriya</i>). <i>Unsurpassed liberation</i> (<i>anuttaravimutti</i>) is liberation of the fruit of arahantship. On the role of careful attention, see 46:51. Right striving is the fourfold right effort; see 45:8, 49:1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n271" href="#fn271">271</a>]</sup> Spk: Māra approached and spoke, thinking: "He won't be satisfied that he himself put forth energy and attained arahantship. Now he is eager to get others to attain it. Let me stop him!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n272" href="#fn272">272</a>]</sup> Spk: Māra's snare (<i>mārapāsa</i>) is the snare of the defilements, that is, the celestial and human cords of sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n273" href="#fn273">273</a>]</sup> This is the Buddha's famous injunction to his first sixty arahant disciples to go forth and spread the Dhamma. The passage also occurs at Vin I 20,36-21,16, in correct temporal sequence, preceding 4:4. Vv. 476-77 follow immediately, though here they are separated and assigned to an encounter in <i>Sāvatthī</i>. A BHS parallel, including the verses, is at Mvu III 415-16; see Jones, 3:416-17.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Spk explains the threefold goodness of the Dhamma in various ways pertaining both to practice and doctrine. For example, virtue is the beginning; serenity, insight, and the path are the middle; the fruits and Nibbāna are the end; or the opening of a sutta is good, and so too the middle portion and the conclusion. When the Buddha went to Uruvelā he converted the thousand <i>jaṭila</i> ascetics, which culminated in the Fire Sermon (35:28).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n274" href="#fn274">274</a>]</sup> Spk: Māra approached and spoke, thinking: "Like one directing a great war, the ascetic Gotama enjoins the sixty men to teach the Dhamma. I am not pleased even if one should teach, let alone sixty. Let me stop him!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n275" href="#fn275">275</a>]</sup> I follow Spk in dividing <i>seyyā</i> and <i>so</i> and in taking <i>seyyā</i> to be dative in sense (Spk = <i>seyyatthāya</i>), and so a pronoun used in apposition to <i>muni</i> (Spk: <i>so Buddhamuni</i>). I also follow Spk in taking <i>seyyā</i> to mean "lodging," though both C.Rh.D and Geiger interpret it as well-being. Spk explains <i>vossajja careyya tattha so</i> thus: "He should live having relinquished — that is, having abandoned — desire for and attachment to his individual existence (i.e., his body and life). "</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n276" href="#fn276">276</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Upadhi</i> here is <i>khandhūpadhi,</i> "acquisitions as the aggregates"; see n. 21. In the last line the change of the subject from the singular to the plural is in the text. Spk: The enlightened do not resort to such a shelter because they have eradicated all fear.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n277" href="#fn277">277</a>]</sup> Be, Se, and Ee2 read <i>dubbhago</i>; Eel <i>dubbhayo</i> (which may be a misprint); SS <i>dubbhato</i>. Spk Like one dead and unconscious (<i>mato viya visaññī viya ca</i>). Spk-pt: A wretch is one who is luckless, whose fortune has been broken; he is similar to the dead and the unconscious.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n278" href="#fn278">278</a>]</sup> Spk: Craving is said to be <i>entangling</i> (<i>jālini</i>) because it spreads net-like over the three realms of existence. It is called <i>binding</i> (<i>visattikā</i>) because it latches on to sense objects such as forms. It <i>leads anywhere</i> [Spk-pt: within the three realms of existence]. The <i>acquisitions</i> that are all destroyed are the aggregates, defilements, volitional formations, and cords of sensual pleasure (see n. 21). <i>Why should this concern you, Māra?:</i> "Māra, why do you go about finding fault with this and that like small flies unable to settle on hot porridge?"

					This sutta might be compared with 4:13 and 9:2, which have a similar theme. I have translated Buddha here as "Awakened One" to highlight the contrast with sleep, but it is uncertain whether such a tension of ideas was intended in the original. On the description of craving as "entangling and binding," see AN II 211-13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n279" href="#fn279">279</a>]</sup> Spk paraphrases: "The good man should live like a baby who, after drinking milk, might lie down on a blanket and fall asleep, unconcerned whether life is long or short."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n280" href="#fn280">280</a>]</sup>  The point may be that as the felly revolves around the stable hub, so the changing forms of life revolve around the stable soul or life-principle. The verse seems to be alluding to a simile in the <i>B.rhadāraṇyaka Upani.sad</i> II.5.15:
					"And as all spokes are contained in the axle and in the felly of a wheel, all beings, and all those selves (of the earth, water, etc.), are contained in that Self" (Muller, <i>The Upanishads</i>, 2:116). See too <i>Chāndogya</i> Upani.sad VII.15.1 (<i>The Upanishads</i>, 1:120).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n281" href="#fn281">281</a>]</sup> <i>Vicakkhukammāya,</i> lit. "for making eyeless." Spk: Out of a desire to destroy the wisdom-eye of the people in the assembly. He is unable to destroy the Buddha's wisdom-eye, but he could do so for the people in the assembly by manifesting a frightening sight or noise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n282" href="#fn282">282</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>In the assemblies:</i> in the eight assemblies (see MN I 72,18-20). <i>Endowed with the powers:</i> endowed with the ten powers of a Tathāgata (see MN I 69-71). At MN I 69,31-34, the Buddha says that, endowed with the ten Tathāgata powers, he roars his lion's roar in the assemblies.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n283" href="#fn283">283</a>]</sup> See 1:38 and n. 86.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n284" href="#fn284">284</a>]</sup> Spk paraphrases <i>kāveyyamatto</i> in pāda a thus: "Do you lie down thinking up a poem like a poet, who lies down intoxicated with the composing of poetry?" The expression recurs at v. 753a. <i>Sampacurā,</i> glossed by <i>bahuvo,</i> is at AN II 59,12 and 61,l0, also in apposition to <i>atthā</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n285" href="#fn285">285</a>]</sup> <i>Muhuɱ muhuɱ,</i> in pāda b, is not in PED, and Spk and Spk-pt are silent, but see MW, s.v. <i>muhur</i>. The expression occurs at Th 125d, glossed by Th-a II 7,13-14 as <i>abhikkhaṇaɱ,</i> and at Th 1129b. glossed by Th-a III 158,8-9 as <i>abhiṇhato.</i> Both glosses mean "often," but here it seems the more literal sense of "moment by moment" or "constantly" is implied. The dart (<i>salla</i>) is elsewhere identified with craving; see vv. 214c, 737c. At 35:90 (IV 64,33-34) it is said that the dart is the state of being stirred (<i>ejā sallaɱ</i>), <i>ejā</i> being a synonym for <i>taṇhā</i>; and the Tathāgata, who is unstirred by craving, dwells with the dart removed (<i>vītasallo</i>). See too MN II 260,17: Sallan ti kho Sunakkhatta taṇhāy'etaɱ adhivacanaɱ.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n286" href="#fn286">286</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Attraction and repulsion</i> (<i>anurodha-virodha</i>): attachment and aversion (<i>rāga-paṭigha</i>). For when someone gives a Dhamma talk, some people express appreciation, and towards them attachment arises; but others listen disrespectfully, and towards them aversion arises. Thus a speaker on the Dhamma becomes caught in attraction and repulsion. But because the Tathāgata is compassionate for others, he is free from attraction and repulsion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n287" href="#fn287">287</a>]</sup> At Vin I 21 this exchange of verses is set in the Deer Park at Isipatana and immediately follows the pair of verses at 4:5. A BHS parallel is at Mvu III 416-17, but the first couplet is equivalent to v. 77ab.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n288" href="#fn288">288</a>]</sup> <i>Antalikkhacaro pāso yo yaɱ carati mānaso.</i> Spk states: "The snare is the snare of lust (<i>rāgapāsa</i>), which binds even those who move in the sky (i.e., by psychic power)." It is more likely <i>antalikkha-caro</i> is intended to suggest the incorporeal nature of lust, which can propel the mind across vast distances; see vv. 210b, 21lb.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n289" href="#fn289">289</a>]</sup> Vedayitaɱ in pāda a and <i>saŋkhataɱ</i> in pāda b are merely metrical adaptations of <i>vedanā and saŋkhārā</i>, the second and fourth aggregates.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n290" href="#fn290">290</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Though they seek him everywhere</i> — in all realms of existence, modes of origin, destinations, stations of consciousness, and abodes of beings — <i>they do not find him</i>, do not see him. See v. 49 (= v.105),4:23 (I 122,1-13), 22:87 (III 124,1-13), and MN 1140,3-7. It seems that both the living arahant and the arahant after his <i>parinibbāna</i> are intended.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n291" href="#fn291">291</a>]</sup> Se and Eel and 2: <i>udrīyati;</i> Be: <i>undrīyati</i>. PED explains as a passive form from <i>ud + d.rṇoti</i>. See MW, s.v. <i>d.ri</i> &gt; pass. <i>diryate</i>. Spk: <i>Ayaɱ mahāpaṭhavi paṭapaṭasaddaɱ kurumānā viya ahosi;</i> "This great earth seemed to be making a crackling sound." Spk-pt: <i>Undriyati ti viparivattati;</i> "'Is splitting open' means: is turning over." The word recurs at 4:22 (I 119,17 foll.). On the evolution of the word in Pāli, see von Hinüber, "Remarks on the Critical Pāli Dictionary (II)," in <i>Selected Papers</i>, pp. 152-55.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n292" href="#fn292">292</a>]</sup> On <i>lokāmisa,</i> "the bait of the world," see n. 10. Spk explains <i>māradheyya</i>, "Māra's realm," as the round of existence with its three realms, which is the place for Māra to stand. The more usual expression is <i>maccudheyya,</i> "the realm of Death," as at v. 16d; the two are effectively synonymous. See too v. 102d and n. 70.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n293" href="#fn293">293</a>]</sup> Se and Eel and 2 have <i>kumārakānaɱ</i> as against Be <i>kumārikānaɱ</i>, "of the young girls." Spk explains that on this day — "a kind of St. Valentine's Day" (KS 1:143, n. 1) — the young girls send presents to their sweethearts among the boys, and the boys send ornaments to the girls, even a garland of flowers if they can give nothing else.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n294" href="#fn294">294</a>]</sup> Spk: Five hundred maidens were about to offer festival cakes to the Buddha, and the Buddha would have given them a discourse at the conclusion of which they would have been established in the fruit of stream-entry; but Māra, wishing to prevent this outcome, took possession of the girls. The expression <i>yathā dhotena pattena,</i> "with a bowl just as cleanly washed as when he entered," is a euphemistic way of saying that the bowl was empty.

					Spk: Māra made a false promise when he offered "to see to it" that the Euddha would get alms. He actually wanted the Buddha to expose himself to ridicule by the village boys (for coming for alms a second time after leaving with an empty bowl).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n295" href="#fn295">295</a>]</sup> Spk explains <i>kiñcana,</i> in pāda b, as "the various kinds of defilements such as the 'something' (called) lust, etc." On the use of <i>kiñcana</i> to denote defilements, see 41:7 (IV 297,lS-19). The devas of Streaming Radiance (<i>devā Ābhassarā</i>) inhabit the highest plane corresponding to the second jhāna, located in the form realm. They are said to subsist on rapture (<i>pitibhakkhā</i>) because they are sustained by the nourishment of the jhāna. The verse occurs at Dhp 200, the story at Dhp-a 257-58; see BL 3:72-73. In the sequel to this verse, omitted in BL, the five hundred girls hear the Buddha's verse and become established in the fruit of stream-entry.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n296" href="#fn296">296</a>]</sup> I follow Spk, which resolves <i>cakkhusamphassaviññāṇāyatana</i> thus: <i>cakkhuviññāṇena sampayutto cakkhusamphasso pi viññāṇāyatanam pi;</i> "eye-contact associated with eye conscious and also the base of consciousness." Spk says that "eye-contact" irnplies all the mental phenomena associated with consciousness; "the base of consciousness," all types of consciousness that have arisen in the eye door beginning with the adverting consciousness (<i>āvajjanacitta</i>). The same method applies to the ear door, etc. But in the mind door, "mind" (<i>mano</i>) is the <i>bhavaŋgacitta</i> together with adverting; "mental phenomena" are the mental objects (<i>ārammaŋadhammā</i>); "mind-contact," the contact associated with <i>bhavaŋga</i> and adverting; and "the base of consciousness," the <i>javanacitta and tadārammaŋacitta,</i> i.e., the "impulsion" and "registration" consciousness. For an account of these types of consciousness (fundamental to the Pāli Abhidhamma), see CMA 3:8.

					Māra's reply, and the Buddha's rejoinder, hinge on the practice of using Pāli words for cattle metaphorically to signify the sense faculties. See GD, pp. 141-42, n. to 26-27. </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n297" href="#fn297">297</a>]</sup> Here the Buddha is obviously referring to Nibbāna. Cp. 35:117 on the cessation of the six sense bases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n298" href="#fn298">298</a>]</sup> A slightly more elaborate version of the incident, including the verses, is recorded at Dhp-a IV 31-33; see BL 3:213-14. Spk: "The Buddha reflected thus with compassion, having seen people afflicted with punishments in realms ruled by unrighteous kings."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n299" href="#fn299">299</a>]</sup> At 51:10 (V 259,18-20 = DN II 103,23-26) it is said that one who has mastery over the four bases for spiritual power could, if he so desired, live on for an aeon or for the remainder of an aeon. Māra has made this appeal to the Buddha, not out of respect for his leadership ability, but because he wants to tempt him with lust for power and thereby keep him under his own control. It is interesting that the sutta does not offer an answer to the question whether righteous governance is possible, and this ambiguity pervades the Pāli Canon as a whole. While some texts admit that righteous rulers do arise (the "wheel-turning monarchs"), the general consensus is that the exercise of rulership usually involves the use of violence and thus is hard to reconcile with perfect observance of the precepts. For an insightful discussion of the ambiguity, see Collins, <i>Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities</i>, pp. 419-36,448-70.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n300" href="#fn300">300</a>]</sup> In pāda c, Be and Se read <i>dvittāva,</i> though the orthography in Eel and 2, <i>dvittā</i> va, is preferable. Spk: "Let alone one mountain, even as much as double (<i>dvikkhattum pi tāva</i>) a large golden mountain would not suffice for one person." BHS parallels to this verse read <i>vittaɱ,</i> treasure, in place of <i>dvittā</i> (see Concordance 1 (B)).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n301" href="#fn301">301</a>]</sup> Spk: "Suffering has its source in the five cords of sensual pleasure; that is 'the source whence it springs' (yatonidānaɱ). When a person has seen this thus, for what reason should he incline to thosee sensual pleasures which are the source of suffering? <i>Upadhi</i> in pāda c is glossed by Spk as <i>kāmaguṇa-upadhi;</i> see n. 21. In place of <i>saŋgo</i>, tie, the BHS versions read <i>.salyam</i> (<i>Pāli sallam</i>), dart.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Spk-Ft: The source of suffering is craving, and the source of craving is the five cords of sensual pleasure. Therefore it is said that the five cords of sensual pleasure — the condition for craving — are the source of suffering. When one wao has fully understood reality has seen suffering as it really is with the eye of wisdom, and seen the cords of sensual pleasure to be its source, there is no reason for him to incline to sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n302" href="#fn302">302</a>]</sup> 302 Spk: "The staff of <i>udumbara</i> wood, slightly crooked, was for the sake of showing that he was of few wishes (<i>appicchabhāva</i>, an ascetic virtue)." In the Vedic sacrifices, <i>udumbara</i> wood was used for all kinds of ritual purposes; the sacrificial post, ladle, and amulets were made of this wood (Macdonell and Keith, <i>Vedic Index,</i> s.v. <i>udumbara</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n303" href="#fn303">303</a>]</sup> See 1:20. Here Māra appears as a proponent of the brahmanical idea that renunciation (<i>sannyāsa</i>) must be postponed until after one has enjoyed a full married life. On how young bhikkhus, lads "in the prime of life, who have not dallied with sensual pleasures," can live the holy life without being overcome by sensual desire, see 35:127.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n304" href="#fn304">304</a>]</sup> This is a gesture of frustration. Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan is described in the same terms at MN I 109,1-2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n305" href="#fn305">305</a>]</sup> Samiddhi has already appeared at 1:20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n306" href="#fn306">306</a>]</sup> As at 4:l7; see n. 29l.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n307" href="#fn307">307</a>]</sup> The verse = Th 46, Samiddhi's sale stanza. I understand buddhā in pāda b to be simply a variant spelling of <i>vuḍḍhā</i> (the reading at Th 46), though Spk glosses <i>buddhā</i> here as <i>ñātā</i>, to which Spk-pṭ adds: <i>Tā ariyamaggena jānanasamatthanabhāvena avabuddhā</i> "They have been comprehended by the noble path through its capacity for knowledge."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n308" href="#fn308">308</a>]</sup> The story of Godaika is told at Dhp-a I 431-33; see BL 2:90-91. Spk explains <i>sāmayikā cetovimutti,</i> "temporary liberation of mind," as the mundane meditative attainments (<i>lokiya-samāpatti</i>), i.e., the jhānas and formless attainments, so called because at the moments of absorption the mind is liberated from the opposing states and is resolved upon its object. He fell away from this liberation of mind on account of illness. Being disposed to chronic illness due to winds, bile, and phlegm (the "three humours" of traditional Indian medicine), he could not fulfil the states conducive to concentration. Each time he entered upon an attainment, he soon fell away from it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n309" href="#fn309">309</a>]</sup> <i>Satthaɱ āhareyyaɱ.</i> A euphemistic expression for suicide; see 22:87 (III 123,10,26), 35:87 (IV 57,6), and 54:9 (V 320,24-25). Spk: He reflected thus: "Since the destination after death of one who has fallen away from jhāna is uncertain, while one who has not fallen away is certain of rebirth in the Brahmā world, let me use the knife." On the Buddha's own attitude towards suicide, see 35:87 (IV 60,1-5).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n310" href="#fn310">310</a>]</sup> Spk: Māra thought: "This ascetic desires to use the knife. This indicates that he is unconcerned with body and life, and such a one is capable of attaining arahantship. If I try to forbid him he will not desist, but if the Teacher forbids him he will." Therefore, pretending to be concerned for the elder's welfare, he approached the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n311" href="#fn311">311</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Jane sutā ti jane vissuta;</i> lit "heard among the people = famed among the people," i.e., widely famed. There is a delicious irony, in the above three verses, in the way Māra — who usually addresses the Buddha discourteously as "ascetic" — here showers him with glowing epithets.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n312" href="#fn312">312</a>]</sup> Spk: The elder, thinking, "What is the use of living?" lay down and slit his jugular vein with a knife. Painful feelings arose. He suppressed them, comprehended the pains (with insight), set up mindfulness, explored his meditation subject, and attained arahantship as a "same-header" (<i>samasīsī;</i> see Pp 13,25-27, commented on at Pp-a 186-87). He was a <i>jīvitasamasīsī,</i> one who attains the destruction of defilements and the end of life simultaneously. (Another kind of <i>samasīsī</i> recovers from a grave illness at the same time that he attains arahantship.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n313" href="#fn313">313</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Vivattakkhandhan ti parivattakkhandhaɱ;</i> "with his shoulder turned" means with twisted shoulder. He had been lying on his back when he took the knife, but because he was accustomed to lying on his right side, he had turned his head towards the right and had so remained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n314" href="#fn314">314</a>]</sup> <i>Appatiṭṭhena ca bhikkhave viññāṇena Godhiko kulaputto parinibbuto.</i> Spk: Māra was searching for his rebirth consciousness (<i>paṭisandhicitta</i>), but Godhika had passed away with rebirth-consciousness unestablished; the meaning is: because it was unestablished (<i>appatiṭṭhitakāraṇā</i>: or, with unestablished cause).

					Spk-pt: <i>Appatiṭṭhena</i> is an instrumental used as an indication of modality (<i>iithambhūtalakkhaṇa</i>). The meaning is: with (consciousness) not subject to arising (<i>anuppattidhammena</i>); for if there were an arising, consciousness would be called "established." But when the commentator says, "because it was unestablished;' what is meant is that the cause for the nonestablisnment of consciousness was precisely the cause for his <i>parinibbāna</i> (<i>yadeva tassa viññāṇassa appatiṭṭhānakāraṇaɱ tad eva parinibbānakāraṇaɱ</i>).

					A similar case of suicide is reported of the bhikkhu Vakkali at 22:87. When the monk is said to attain final Nibbana with conscioasness unestablished, this should not be understood to mean that after death consciousness survives in an "unestablished" condition (a thesis argued by Harvey, <i>The Selfless Mind</i>, pp, 208-210); for enough texts make it plain that with the passing away of the arahant consciousness too ceases and no longer exists (see, e.g., 12:51).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n315" href="#fn315">315</a>]</sup> The verse (which must have been added by the redactors) occurs at Sn 449, wltere, however, it follows the verses that correspond to vv. 504-5. In the verse Māra is spoken of as <i>yakkha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n316" href="#fn316">316</a>]</sup> Spk explains the seven years of pursuit as the Buddha's six years (of striving) before the enlightenment and the first year after. However, the: next sutta, which apparently follows in immediate temporal sequence, is the temptation by Māra's. daughters, which other sources clearly place right after the enlightenment (see n.322). The present sutta seems to confirm this by locating the dialogue with Māra at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree, in the vicinity of the Bodhi Tree. The commentaries generally assign the Buddha's stay under this tree to the fifth week after the enlightenment (see Ja I 78,9-11).

					<i>Seeking to gain access</i> (<i>otārāpekkho</i>). Spk: He thought: "If I see anything improper (<i>ananucchavikaɱ</i>) in the ascetic Gotama's conduct through the body door, etc., I will reprove him." But he could not find even a dust mote (of misconduct) to be washed away. On <i>otāra</i> (= <i>vivara</i>, Spk) see 35:240 (IV 178,13-16,33), 35:243 (IV 185,11-15; 186,27-30), 47:6 (V 147,17-18, 27-28), 47:7 (V 149,7,16).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n317" href="#fn317">317</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Bhavalobhajappan ti bhavalobhasaŋkhātaɱ taṇhaɱ;</i> "The greedy urge for existence is craving consisting in greed for existence."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n318" href="#fn318">318</a>]</sup> I read pāda d with Be, Se, and Ee2: <i>yaɱ saccaɱ taɱ nirūpadhiɱ</i> (Eel: <i>yaɱ sabbantaɱ nirūpadhiɱ</i>). Nibbāna, the supreme truth (<i>paramasacca</i>), is often described as <i>sabbupadhipaṭinissagga,</i> "the relinquishing of all acquisitions," and here as nirūpadhi. See n. 21.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n319" href="#fn319">319</a>]</sup> The same simile occurs in a very different context at MN I 234,7-18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n320" href="#fn320">320</a>]</sup> <i>Nibbejaniyā gāthā.</i> Spk glosses <i>nibbejaniyā</i> as <i>ukkaṇṭhanīyā</i> (dissatisfaction) but does not explain the derivation. It is likely the word is related to <i>nibbidā,</i> though employed in a different sense; see MW, s.v. <i>nirvid</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n321" href="#fn321">321</a>]</sup> This passage, as far as "unable to speak," is the stock description of the defeated contestant; also at MN I 132,28-30, 234,1-2, 258,28-30. Se and Eel make this paragraph the last of the preceding sutta, but I follow Be and Ee2. As the two suttas form a single narrative, the division between them is arbitrary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n322" href="#fn322">322</a>]</sup> Their names mean craving, discontent, and lusting. Spk explains that they saw their father in a despondent mood and approached to find out the reason. The story of the Buddha's encounter with Māra's daughters is also recorded at Ja I 78-79 and Dhp-a III 195-98; see BL 3:33-34. There it is clearly set in the fifth week after the enlightenment. The BHS parallel at Mvu III 281-86 is also assigned to this period; see Jones, 3:269-74.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n323" href="#fn323">323</a>]</sup> Spk's explanation shows that there is more to the simile than meets the eye: "They capture an elephant and lead him out of the forest by sending a female decoy, who entices him by displaying her feminine wiles."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n324" href="#fn324">324</a>]</sup> On the idiom <i>pāde te samaṇa paricārema,</i> Geiger remarks:

					"In courteous speech one uses <i>pādā,</i> feet, for the person. The meaning is: 'We want to be at your command like slave-women'" (GermTr p. 193, n. 5). A sexual innuendo is unmistakable. Spk, strangely, does not offer any explanation here of <i>anuttare upadhisaŋkhaye vimutto</i> but see n.356.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n325" href="#fn325">325</a>]</sup> 325 Spk glosses <i>senaɱ</i> as <i>kilesasenaɱ</i> "the army of defilements," and paraphrases: "Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable, meditating alone, I discovered the bliss of arahantship, which is called 'the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart' (<i>atthassa pattiɱ hadayassa santiɱ</i>)." Mahākaccāna provides a long commentary on this verse at AN V 47,3-48,4 On piyarūpaɱ sātarūpaɱ "the pleasant and agreeable," see 12:66 (II 109-12), DN II 308-11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n326" href="#fn326">326</a>]</sup> Both the BHS version of these verses (at Mvu III 283-84) and the Skt (cited at Ybhu.s 4:1-3; Enomoto, CSCS, pp. 25-26) have the present tense <i>tarati</i> in pāda b, as against the aorist <i>atari</i> in the <i>Pāli</i> while the present makes better sense, I translate following the Pāli .</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Spk: Five floods crossed (<i>pañcoghatiṇṇo</i>): one who has crossed the flood of defilements in the five sense doors. <i>The Sixth</i>: he has crossed the sixth flood of defilements, that pertaining to the mind door. Or alternatively: by the mention of five floods, the five lower fetters are meant; by the sixth, the five higher fetters.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n327" href="#fn327">327</a>]</sup> Spk: <i>Tranquil in body</i> (<i>passaddhikāyo</i>): this comes about with the tranquillizing of the in-and-out breathing by the fourth jhāna (SE."e' A:\I [] U/21-:28). <i>In mind well liberated</i> (<i>suvimuttacitto</i>): well liberated by the liberation of the fruit of arahantshi. <i>Not generating</i> <i>(asaŋkharāno):</i> not generating the three types of volitional formations (see 12:51; also n. 165). <i>Meditating thought-free</i> in the fourth jhāna. <i>He does not erupt, etc.</i>: He does not erupt <i>(na kuppati)</i> because of hatred, or drift (<i>sarati</i>) because of lust, or stiffen (<i>na thīno</i> because of delusion. Or alternatively: by the first term the hindrance of ill will is intended; by the second, the hindrance of sensual desire; by the third, the remaining hindrances (see 46:2).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n328" href="#fn328">328</a>]</sup> In pāda a, I read <i>acchejji</i> with Se, an aorist of <i>chindati,</i> to cut. The finite verb seems to me preferable to the absolutive <i>acchejja</i> of Be and Eel and 2; the variant <i>acchecchi</i> suggested by PED may also be acceptable. This verb should be distinguished from <i>acchejja</i> (or <i>acchijja,</i> Eel) in pāda d, an absolutive of <b>acchindati,</b> to rob, to snatch away. The Be and Eel reading of pāda a may have arisen through a confusion of the two forms.

					I read pāda b: <i>addhā tarissanti bahū ca sattā.</i> Be, Ee2, and SS read the last word as <i>saddhā,</i> but the gloss in Spk supports <i>sattā: addhā aññe pi bahujanā ekaɱsena tarissanti.</i> The BHT version of Mvu is too different to be of help and may be corrupt, but Jones (at 3:273, n. 4) suggests replacing <i>raktā</i> with <i>sattvā,</i> which would then support the reading I have adopted. <i>Tarissanti</i> is certainly preferable to the v.l. <i>carissanti,</i> found in Be, Se, and EeL</p>
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n329" href="#fn329">329</a>]</sup> The verse occurs in a different context at Vin I 43,27-28. I follow Be and Se in reading, in pāda c, the active <i>nayamānānaɱ,</i> the prevalent reading of Vin. Eel and 2, on the basis of SS, read the passive <i>nīyamānānaɱ/niyyamānānaɱ.</i> BHS versions at Uv 21:8 and Mvu III 90 also have the active form, while the Prakrit at G-Dhp 267 is ambiguous.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n330" href="#fn330">330</a>]</sup> In the BHS version vv. 516-17 are ascribed to the Buddha. The concluding verse was apparently added by the redactors.</p>
