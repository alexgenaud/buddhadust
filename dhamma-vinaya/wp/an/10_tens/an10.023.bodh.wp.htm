					<p class="f4">There are things to be abandoned by speech, not by body.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are things to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, are the things to be abandoned by body, not by speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome deed with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">His wise fellow monks investigate him and say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have committed a particular unwholesome deed with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would really be good if you would abandon bodily misconduct and develop bodily good conduct.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When his wise fellow monks investigate him and speak to him, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are called things to be abandoned by body, not by speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the things to be abandoned by speech, not by body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has committed a particular unwholesome deed by speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">His wise fellow monks investigate him and say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have committed a particular unwholesome deed by speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would really be good if you would abandon verbal misconduct and develop verbal good conduct.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When his wise fellow monks investigate him and speak to him, he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are called things to be abandoned by speech, not by body.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the things to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech, but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Greed is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech, but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Miserliness is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Evil envy, bhikkhus, is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is evil envy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a householder or householder's son is prospering in wealth or grain, in silver or gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh, may this householder or householder's son not prosper in wealth or grain, in silver or gold!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or else an ascetic or brahmin gains robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another ascetic or brahmin might think of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh, may this venerable one not gain robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick!'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called evil envy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil envy is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Evil desire, bhikkhus, is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is evil desire?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, one without faith desires:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them know me as one endowed with faith.'</p>

					<p class="f4">An immoral person desires:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them know me as virtuous.'</p>

					<p class="f4">One with little learning desires:</p>

					<p class="f4">One who is lazy desires:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them know me as energetic.'</p>

					<p class="f4">One who is muddle-minded desires:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them know me as mindful.'</p>

					<p class="f4">One who is unconcentrated desires:</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil desire is to be abandoned neither by body nor by speech but by having repeatedly seen with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, bhikkhus, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and continues on; if hatred ... delusion ... anger ... hostility ... denigration ... insolence ... miserliness ... evil envy ... evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and continues on, he should be understood thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one does not understand in such a way he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and continues on.</p>
