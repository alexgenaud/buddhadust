					<p class="f4">There the Venerable Mahā Cunda addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend!" those <a id="pt42" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.024.pali.bd.htm#pg42"><span class="f2">[42]</span></a> bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Mahā Cunda said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, making a declaration of knowledge, a bhikkhu says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know this Dhamma, I see this Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; if hatred ... delusion ... anger ... hostility ... denigration ... insolence ... miserliness ... evil envy ... evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no hatred ... no delusion ... no anger ... no hostility ... no denigration ... no insolence ... no miserliness ... no evil envy ... no evil desire; thus evil desire overcomes him and persists.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, making a declaration of development, a bhikkhu says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am developed in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, greed overcomes that bhikkhu and persists; if hatred ... evil desire overcomes that bhikkhu and persists, he should be understood thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one does not understand in such a way that he would have no greed; thus greed overcomes him and persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because when he wants to buy something, he cannot pay with money, grain, silver, or gold.</p>
