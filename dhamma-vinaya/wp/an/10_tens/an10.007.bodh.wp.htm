					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that<br />
					(1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth;<br />
					(2) of water in relation to water;<br />
					(3) of fire in relation to fire;<br />
					(4) of air in relation to air;<br />
					(5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space;<br />
					(6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness;<br />
					(7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness;<br />
					(8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception;<br />
					(9) of this world in relation to this world;<br />
					(10) of the other world in relation to the other world,<br />
					but he would still be percipient."</p>

					<p class="f4">"He could, friend Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, friend Sāriputta could he obtain such a state of concentration?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"On one occasion, friend Ānanda, I was dwelling right here in Sāvatthī in the Blind Men's Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I attained such a state of concentration that<br />
					I was not percipient of earth in relation to earth;<br />
					of water in relation to water;<br />
					of fire in relation to fire;<br />
					of air in relation to air;<br />
					of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space;<br />
					of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness;<br />
					of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness;<br />
					of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception;<br />
					of this world in relation to this world;<br />
					of the other world in relation to the other world,<br />
					but I was still percipient."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But of what was the Venerable Sāriputta percipient on that occasion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"One perception arose and another perception ceased in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The cessation of existence is Nibbāna;<br />
					the cessation of existence is Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, when a fire of twigs is burning, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so one perception <a id="pt10" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.006.pali.bd.htm#pg10"><span class="f2">[10]</span></a> arose and another perception ceased in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The cessation of existence is Nibbāna;<br />
					the cessation of existence is Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion, friend, I was percipient:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The cessation of existence is Nibbāna.'"</p>
