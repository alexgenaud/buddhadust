					<p class="f4">(1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous ... he trains in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He has learnt much ... and penetrated well by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) Both Pātimokkha s have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) He is able to look after a patient or to get someone else to look after him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) He is able to eliminate one's dissatisfaction or to get someone else to eliminate it.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) He is able to use the Dhamma to dispel regrets that might arise [in his pupils].</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) He is able to dissuade them, by way of the Dhamma, from erroneous views that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) He is able to encourage them in the higher virtuous behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) He is able to encourage them in the higher mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">(10) He is able to encourage them in the higher wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may give full ordination."</p>
