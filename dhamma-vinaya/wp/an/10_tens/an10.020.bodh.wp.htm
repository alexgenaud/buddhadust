					<p class="f4"><a id="pt30" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.020.pali.bd.htm#pg30"><span class="f2">[30]</span></a> There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, there are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones abide in the past, present, or future.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, a bhikkhu<br />
					(1) has abandoned five factors;<br />
					(2) possesses six factors;<br />
					(3) has a single guard<br />
					(4) and four supports;<br />
					(5) has dispelled personal truths,<br />
					(6) totally renounced seeking,<br />
					(7) purified his intentions,<br />
					(8) tranquilized bodily activity, and become<br />
					(9) well liberated in mind and<br />
					(10) well liberated by wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And how has a bhikkhu abandoned five factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. It is in this way that a bhikkhu has abandoned five factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how does a bhikkhu possess six factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having smelled an odor with the nose ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having experienced a taste with the tongue ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having felt a tactile object with the body ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu possesses six factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And how does a bhikkhu have a single guard?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu possesses a mind guarded by mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has a single guard.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And how does a bhikkhu have four supports?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things, patiently endures other things, avoids still other things, and dispels still other things.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has four supports.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt31" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.020.pali.bd.htm#pg31"><span class="f2">[31]</span></a> (5) "And how has a bhikkhu dispelled personal truths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, whatever ordinary personal truths may be held by ordinary ascetics and brahmins — that is,<br />
					'The world is eternal'<br />
					or<br />
					'The world is not eternal';<br />
					'The world is finite'<br />
					or<br />
					'The world is infinite';<br />
					'The soul and the body are the same'<br />
					or<br />
					'The soul is one thing and the body another';<br />
					'The Tathāgata exists after death'<br />
					or<br />
					'The Tathāgata does not exist after death'<br />
					or<br />
					'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death'<br />
					or<br />
					'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'<br />
					— a bhikkhu has discarded and dispelled them all, given them up, rejected them, let go of them, abandoned and relinquished them.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has dispelled personal truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "And how has a bhikkhu totally renounced seeking?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the search for sensual pleasures and the search for existence and has allayed the search for a spiritual life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has totally renounced seeking.</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "And how has a bhikkhu purified his intentions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned sensual intention, intention of ill will, and intention of harming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has purified his intentions.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "And how has a bhikkhu tranquilized bodily activity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has tranquilized bodily activity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) "And how is a bhikkhu well liberated in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu's mind is liberated from lust, hatred, and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu is well liberated in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">(10) "And how is a bhikkhu well liberated by wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt32" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.020.pali.bd.htm#pg32"><span class="f2">[32]</span></a> Here, a bhikkhu understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have abandoned lust, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; I have abandoned hatred ... abandoned delusion, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu is well liberated by wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, whatever noble ones in the past abided in noble abodes, all abided in these same ten noble abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever noble ones in the future will abide in noble abodes, all will abide in these same ten noble abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever noble ones at present abide in noble abodes, all abide in these same ten noble abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones abide in the past, present, or future."</p>
