					<p class="f4">'A first point of craving for existence, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no craving for existence and afterwards it came into being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Still, craving for existence is seen to have a specific condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say, bhikkhus, that craving for existence has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for craving for existence?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for ignorance?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said:</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for not hearing the good Dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: not associating with good persons.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma....</p>

					<p class="f4">The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance, becoming full, fills up craving for existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there is nutriment for craving for existence, and in this way it becomes full.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope ... <a id="pt118" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.062.pali.bd.htm#pg118"><span class="f2">[118]</span></a> ... and the rivers, becoming full, fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, not associating with good persons, becoming full, fills up not hearing the good Dhamma ... and ignorance, becoming full, fills up craving for existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there is nutriment for craving for existence, and in this way it becomes full.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say, bhikkhus, that</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) true knowledge and liberation have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for true knowledge and liberation?</p>
