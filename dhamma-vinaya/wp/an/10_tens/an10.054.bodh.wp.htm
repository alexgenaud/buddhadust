<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Tens, Sutta 54. The Buddha gives two criteria for evaluating the knowledge of one's own heart: attainment of higher wisdom and insight into Dhamma, and calm of heart; and then he gives a method for judging the right course to take with regard to clothing, food, location and persons." />

					<p class="f4">'I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that you should train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a woman or a man, young, youthful, and fond of ornaments, would look at their own facial reflection in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it; <a id="pt99" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.054.pali.bd.htm#pg99"><span class="f2">[99]</span></a> and their wish fulfilled, they will think, 'How fortunate for me that I'm clean!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do I gain internal serenity of mind or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I gain internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he should base himself on internal serenity of mind and make an effort to gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he should base himself on the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and make an effort to gain internal serenity of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, some time later, he gains both the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I gain neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,' he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish [the fire on] his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, <a id="pt100" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.054.pali.bd.htm#pg100"><span class="f2">[100]</span></a> effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I gain both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.</p>
