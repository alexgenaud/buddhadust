					<p class="f4">"Here, Upāli,</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) bhikkhus explain non-Dhamma as non-Dhamma, and (2) Dhamma as Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) They explain non-discipline as non-discipline, and (4) discipline as discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) They explain what has not been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as not having been stated and uttered by him, and</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) what has been stated and uttered by the Tathāgata as having been stated and uttered by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) They explain what has not been practiced by the Tathāgata as not having been practiced by him, and</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) what has been practiced by the Tathāgata as having been practiced by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) They explain what has not been prescribed by the Tathāgata as not having been prescribed by him, and</p>

					<p class="f4">(10) what has been prescribed by the Tathāgata as having been prescribed by him. On these ten grounds, they do not withdraw and go apart.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not perform legal acts separately or recite the Pātimokkha  separately.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, Upāli, that there is concord in the Saŋgha."</p>
