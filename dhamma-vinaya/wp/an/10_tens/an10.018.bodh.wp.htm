One without a protector lives in suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha,  possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Having considered:]</p>

					<p class="f4">Since they all have compassion for him, only growth in wholesome qualities and not decline is to be expected for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a quality that serves as a protector.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, a bhikkhu has learnt much, remembers what he has learnt, and accumulates what he has learnt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings that are good in the beginning ... with the right meaning and phrasing, which proclaim the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life — such teachings as these he has learnt much of, retained in mind, recited verbally, investigated mentally, and penetrated well by view.</p>
