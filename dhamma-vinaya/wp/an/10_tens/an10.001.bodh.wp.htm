					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Bhante, what is the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior."</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of non-regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy."</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of joy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of joy is rapture."</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of rapture."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility."</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of tranquility."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure."</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of pleasure."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of pleasure <a id="pt2" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.050.pali.bd.htm#pg2"><span class="f2">[2]</span></a> is concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are."</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">(10) "And what, bhante, is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Ānanda, (1) — (2) the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret;<br />
					(3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy;<br />
					(4) the purpose and benefit of joy is rapture;<br />
					(5) the purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility;<br />
					(6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure;<br />
					(7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration;<br />
					(8) the purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are;<br />
					(9) the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion; and<br />
					(10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtuous behavior progressively leads to the foremost."</p>
