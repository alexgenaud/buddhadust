					<p class="f4">Listen and attend closely.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, bhante," those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this: "And what, bhikkhus, is that exposition of the Dhamma on creeping?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, beings are the owners of their kamma, the heirs of their kamma; they have kamma as their origin, kamma as their relative, kamma as their resort; whatever kamma they do, good or bad, they are its heirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He creeps along by body, speech, and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">His bodily kamma is crooked; his verbal kamma is crooked; his mental kamma is crooked.</p>

					<p class="f4">His destination is crooked; his rebirth is crooked.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for one with a crooked destination and rebirth, I say, there is one of two destinations: either the exclusively painful hells or a species of creeping animal.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the species of creeping animals?</p>

					<p class="f4">The snake, the scorpion, the centipede, the mongoose, the cat, the mouse, and the owl, or any other animals that creep away when they see people.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has been reborn, contacts affect one.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, I say, that beings are the heirs of their kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">His bodily kamma is straight; his verbal kamma is straight; his mental kamma is straight.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for one with a straight destination and rebirth, I say, there is one of two destinations: either the exclusively pleasant heavens or eminent families, such as those of affluent khattiyas, affluent brahmins, or affluent householders, [families that are] rich, with great wealth and property, abundant gold and silver, abundant treasures and belongings, abundant wealth and grain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a being is reborn from a being; one is reborn through one's deeds.</p>
