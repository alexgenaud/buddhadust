					<p class="f4">'A first point of ignorance, bhikkhus, is not seen such that before this there was no ignorance and afterwards it came into being.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Still, ignorance is seen to have a specific condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say, bhikkhus, that ignorance has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for ignorance?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: the five hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">The five hindrances, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for the five hindrances?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: the three kinds of misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">The three kinds of misconduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of misconduct?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: non-restraint of the sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Non-restraint of the sense faculties, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for non-restraint of the sense faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for lack of mindfulness and clear comprehension?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: careless attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">Careless attention, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the nutriment for careless attention?</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be said: lack of faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lack of faith, too, I say, has a nutriment; it is not without nutriment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Non-restraint of the sense faculties, becoming full, fills up the three kinds of misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">The three kinds of misconduct, becoming full, fill up the five hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">The five hindrances, becoming full, fill up ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there is nutriment for ignorance, and in this way it becomes full.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, when it is raining and the rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountaintop, the water flows down along the slope and fills the clefts, gullies, and creeks; these, becoming full, fill up the pools; these, becoming full, fill up the lakes; these, becoming full, fill up the streams; these, becoming full, fill up the rivers; and these, becoming full, fill up the great ocean; thus there is nutriment for the great ocean, and in this way it becomes full.</p>
