					<p class="f4">Then the female lay follower Kāḷī of Kuraraghara approached him, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, this was said by the Blessed One in 'The Maidens' Questions':</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having conquered the army of the pleasant and agreeable, meditating alone, I discovered bliss, the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore I don't form intimate ties with people, nor does intimacy with anyone get a chance with me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Some ascetics and brahmins, sister, for whom the attainment of the earth <i>kasiṇa</i> is supreme, generated it as their goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the earth <i>kasiṇa</i> is supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path.</p>

					<p class="f4">By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Some ascetics and brahmins, sister, for whom the attainment of the water <i>kasiṇa</i> ... the fire <i>kasiṇa</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the air <i>kasiṇa</i> ... the blue <i>kasiṇa</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the yellow <i>kasiṇa</i> ... the red <i>kasiṇa</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the white <i>kasiṇa</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the space <i>kasiṇa</i> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the consciousness <i>kasiṇa</i> is supreme, generated it as their goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One directly knew to what extent the attainment of the consciousness <i>kasiṇa</i> is supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having directly known this, he saw the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path.</p>

					<p class="f4">By seeing the beginning, the danger, and the escape, and by seeing the knowledge and vision of the path and the non-path, he knew the attainment of the goal, the peace of the heart.</p>
