					<p class="f4">(1) "And how, bhikkhus, has a bhikkhu dispelled personal truths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, whatever ordinary personal truths may be held by ordinary ascetics and brahmins — that is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The world is eternal' or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The world is not eternal';</p>

					<p class="f4">'The world is finite' or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The world is infinite';</p>

					<p class="f4">'The soul and the body are the same' or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The soul is one thing, the body another';</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death,' or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata does not exist after death,' or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death,' or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' —</p>

					<p class="f4">a bhikkhu has discarded and dispelled them all, given them up, rejected them, let go of them, abandoned and relinquished them.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has dispelled personal truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how has a bhikkhu totally renounced seeking?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the search for sensual pleasures and the search for existence and has allayed the search for a spiritual life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has totally renounced seeking.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And how has a bhikkhu tranquilized bodily activity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has tranquilized bodily activity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And how has a bhikkhu drawn back? Here, a bhikkhu has abandoned the conceit 'I am,' cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no longer subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has drawn back.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has dispelled personal truths, totally renounced seeking, and tranquilized bodily activity is said to have drawn back."</p>

							seeking for existence,<br />
