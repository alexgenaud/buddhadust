					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does Master Gotama praise sacrifice."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not praise all sacrifice, brahmin, nor do I withhold praise from all sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) I do not praise a violent sacrifice at which cattle, goats, rams, chickens, and pigs are slain, at which various creatures are led to slaughter.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because arahants and those who have entered the path to arahantship do not attend a violent sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "But I praise a non-violent sacrifice at which cattle, goats, rams, chickens, and pigs are not slain, where various creatures are not slaughtered, that is, a regular giving, a sacrifice offered by family custom.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because arahants and those who have entered the path to arahantship attend a non-violent sacrifice."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When a sacrifice is timely and allowable,<br />
							well prepared and non-violent,<br />
							<a id="pt44" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.040.pali.bd.htm#pg44"><span class="f2">[44]</span></a> the self-controlled followers of the spiritual life<br />
							attend such a sacrifice as this.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Those in the world who have removed the coverings,<br />
							transcenders of time and destination,<br />
							the Buddhas who are proficient in sacrifice,<br />
							praise this kind of sacrifice.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Having prepared an appropriate gift,<br />
							whether of the ordinary kind or in memory of the dead,<br />
							one makes the sacrifice with a confident mind<br />
							to a fertile field, to followers of the spiritual life.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When what has been properly obtained<br />
							is properly offered, properly sacrificed,<br />
							to those worthy of offerings,<br />
							the sacrifice is vast and the deities are pleased.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The wise person endowed with faith,<br />
							having sacrificed thus with a generous mind,<br />
							is reborn in a happy world,<br />
							in [a realm] without affliction.</p>
