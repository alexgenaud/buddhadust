					<p class="f4">"Does Master Gotama praise sacrifice."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not praise all sacrifice, brahmin, nor do I withhold praise from all sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) I do not praise a violent sacrifice at which cattle, goats, rams, chickens, and pigs are slain, at which various creatures are led to slaughter.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because arahants and those who have entered the path to arahantship do not attend a violent sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "But I praise a non-violent sacrifice at which cattle, goats, rams, chickens, and pigs are not slain, where various creatures are not slaughtered, that is, a regular giving, a sacrifice offered by family custom.</p>
