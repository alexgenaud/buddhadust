<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fours, Sutta 24. The Buddha explains that his statement that he knows and understands whatsoever in the world, with its Maras, Brahmas, hosts of recluses and brahmins, devas and mankind, is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, searched into, pondered over by the mind, is to be understood as a simple statement of fact and is not a brag and that because he does know these things, to say otherwise would be a lie." />

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāketa, at Kāḷaka's Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt25" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.024.pali.bd.htm#pg25"><span class="f2">[25]</span></a> "Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind — that I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind — that I have directly known.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has been known by the Tathāgata, but the Tathāgata did not become subservient to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, 'In this world with its devas ... whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind — that I do not know,' that would be a falsehood on my part.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, 'In this world with its devas ... whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind — that I both know and do not know,' that too would be just the same.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, if I were to say, 'In this world with its devas ... whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind — that I neither know nor do not know,' that would be a fault on my part.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "So, having seen what can be seen, the Tathāgata does not misconceive the seen, does not misconceive the unseen, does not misconceive what can be seen, does not misconceive one who sees.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) Having heard what can be heard, he does not misconceive the heard, does not misconceive the unheard, does not misconceive what can be heard, does not misconceive one who hears.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) Having sensed what can be sensed, he does not misconceive the sensed, does not misconceive the unsensed, does not misconceive what can be sensed, does not misconceive one who senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) Having cognized what can be cognized, he does not misconceive the cognized, does not misconceive the uncognized, does not misconceive what can be cognized, does not misconceive one who cognizes.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, bhikkhus, being ever stable among things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, the Tathāgata is a stable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, I say, there is no stable one more excellent or sublime than that stable one."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Amidst those who are self-constrained, the Stable One<br />
							would not serve as categorically true or false<br />
							anything seen, heard, or sensed,<br />
							clung to and considered truth by others.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Since they have already seen this dart<br />
							to which people cling and adhere,<br />
							<a id="pt26" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.024.pali.bd.htm#pg26"><span class="f2">[26]</span></a> [saying] "I know, I see, it is just so,"<br />
							the Tathāgata's cling to nothing.</p>
