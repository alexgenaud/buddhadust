					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Here, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first stream of merit...</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second stream of merit...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Again, a noble disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Saŋgha thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Saŋgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals — this Saŋgha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third stream of merit...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "Again, a noble disciple possesses the virtuous behavior loved by the noble ones, unbroken, flawless, unblemished, <a id="pt57" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.052.pali.bd.htm#pg57"><span class="f2">[57]</span></a> unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth stream of merit...</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the four streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness — heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven — that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When one has faith in the Tathāgata,<br />
							unshakable and well established,<br />
							and virtuous behavior that is good,<br />
							loved by the noble ones and praised;<br />
							when one has confidence in the Saŋgha<br />
							and one's view has been straightened out,<br />
							they say that one is not poor,<br />
							that one's life is not lived in vain.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore an intelligent person,<br />
							remembering the Buddhas' teaching,<br />
							should be intent on faith and virtuous behavior,<br />
							confidence and vision of the Dhamma.</p>
