					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, we describe someone who possesses four qualities as a great man with great wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Here, someone is highly learned in the various fields of learning.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He understands the meaning of various statements, so that he can say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the meaning of this statement; this is the meaning of that one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He has a good memory; he remembers and recollects what was done and said long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) He is skillful and diligent in attending to the diverse chores of a householder; he possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.</p>

					<p class="f4">We describe someone who possesses these four qualities as a great man with great wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">If Master Gotama thinks what I say should be approved, let him approve it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he thinks what I say should be rejected, let him reject it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I neither approve of your [statement], brahmin, nor do I reject it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt36" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.035.pali.bd.htm#pg36"><span class="f2">[36]</span></a> Rather, I describe one who possesses four [other] qualities as a great man with great wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Here, he is practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; he is one who has established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He thinks whatever he wants to think and does not think what he does not want to think; he intends whatever he wants to intend and does not intend what he does not want to intend; thus he has attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I neither approve of your [statement], brahmin, nor do I reject it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I describe someone who possesses these four qualities as a great man with great wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how well this has been stated by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we consider Master Gotama as one who possesses these four qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) For he is practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; he is one who has established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He thinks whatever he wants to think and does not think what he does not want to think; he intends whatever he wants to intend and does not intend what he does not want to intend; thus he has attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, he dwells in it."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt37" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.035.pali.bd.htm#pg37"><span class="f2">[37]</span></a> "Surely, brahmin, your words are prying and intrusive.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless, I will answer you.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Indeed, I am practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; I have established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) I think what I want to think and do not think what I do not want to think; I intend what I want to intend and do not intend what I do not want to intend; thus I have attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) With the destruction of the taints, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, I dwell in it."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He who found for the sake of all beings<br />
							release from the snare of death;<br />
							who revealed the Dhamma, the method,<br />
							for the benefit of devas and humans;<br />
							he in whom many people gain confidence<br />
							when they see and listen to him;<br />
							the one skilled in the path and what is not the path,<br />
							the taintless one who accomplished his task;<br />
							the Enlightened One bearing his final body<br />
							is called "a great man of great wisdom."</p>
