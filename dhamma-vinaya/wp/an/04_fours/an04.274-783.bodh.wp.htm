					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, four things are to be developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) ... mind in mind ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) ... phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">For direct knowledge of lust, these four things are to be developed."</p>

					Four Right Strivings</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, four things are to be developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) ... for the arising of unarisen wholesome states ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) ... for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives.</p>

					<p class="f4">For direct knowledge of lust, these four things are to be developed."</p>

					Four Bases for Psychic Potency</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge of lust, four things are to be developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire and activities of striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to energy ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) ... that possesses concentration due to mind ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) ... that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. For direct knowledge of lust, these four things are to be developed."</p>
