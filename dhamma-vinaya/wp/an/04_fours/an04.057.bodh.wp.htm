					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the Koliyan daughter Suppavāsā here he sat down in the prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Koliyan daughter Suppavāsā,<a id="pt63" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.057.pali.bd.htm#pg63"><span class="f2">[63]</span></a> with her own hand, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, the Koliyan daughter Suppavāsā sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to her:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppavāsā a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">She gives life, beauty, happiness, and strength.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Having given life, she partakes of life, whether celestial or human.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) Having given beauty, she partakes of beauty, whether celestial or human.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) Having given happiness, she partakes of happiness, whether celestial or human.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) Having given strength, she partakes of strength, whether celestial or human.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppavāsā, a female noble disciple who gives food gives the recipients these four things."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When one gives well-prepared food,<br />
							pure, delicious, and flavorful,<br />
							to the upright ones who are<br />
							exalted and of excellent conduct,<br />
							that offering, which links merit with merit,<br />
							is praised as very fruitful<br />
							by the world-knowers.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Those recollecting such generosity<br />
							dwell in the world inspired by joy.<br />
							Having removed the stain of miserliness and its root,<br />
							blameless, they go to the heavenly abode.</p>
