The brahmin Doṇa was also traveling along the highway between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setavya.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahmin Doṇa then saw the thousand-spoked wheels of the Blessed One's footprints, with their rims and hubs, complete in all respects, and thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is astounding and amazing!</p>

					<p class="f4">These surely could not be the footprints of a human being!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt38" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.036.pali.bd.htm#pg38"><span class="f2">[38]</span></a> Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tracking the Blessed One's footprints, the brahmin Doṇa saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of the tree — graceful, inspiring confidence, with peaceful faculties and peaceful mind, one who had attained to the highest taming and serenity, [like] a tamed and guarded bull elephant with controlled faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then approached the Blessed One and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Could you be a deva, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will not be a deva, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Could you be a gandhabba, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will not be a gandhabba, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Could you be a yakkha, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will not be a yakkha, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "Could you be a human being, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will not be a human being, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When you are asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Could you be a deva, sir?'</p>

					<p class="f4">you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will not be a deva, brahmin.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When you are asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Could you be a gandhabba, sir?'</p>

					<p class="f4">you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will not be a gandhabba, brahmin.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When you are asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Could you be a yakkha, sir?'</p>

					<p class="f4">you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will not be a yakkha, brahmin.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When you are asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Could you be a human being, sir?'</p>

					<p class="f4">you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will not be a human being, brahmin.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What, then, could you be, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Brahmin, I have abandoned those taints because of which I might have become a deva; I have cut them off at the root, made them like palm stumps, obliterated them so that they are no longer subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) I have abandoned those taints because of which I might have become a gandhabba ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) ... might have become a yakkha ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) ... might have become a human being; I have cut them off at the root, made them like palm stumps, obliterated them so that they are no longer subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a blue, red, or white lotus flower, though born in the water and grown up in the water, rises above the water and stands <a id="pt39" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.036.pali.bd.htm#pg39"><span class="f2">[39]</span></a> unsoiled by the water, even so, though born in the world and grown up in the world, I have overcome the world and dwell unsoiled by the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Remember me, brahmin, as a Buddha.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"I have destroyed those taints by which<br />
							I might have been reborn as a deva<br />
							or as a gandhabba that travels through the sky;<br />
							by which I might have reached the state of a yakkha,<br />
							or arrived back at the human state:<br />
							I have dispelled and cut down these taints.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"As a lovely white lotus<br />
							is not soiled by the water,<br />
							I am not soiled by the world:<br />
							therefore, O brahmin, I am a Buddha."</p>
