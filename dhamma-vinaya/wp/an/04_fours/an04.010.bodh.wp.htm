					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, the bond of views, and the bond of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the bond of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one does not understand these things as they really are, then sensual lust, sensual delight, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, sensual thirst, sensual passion, sensual attachment, and sensual craving lie deep within one in regard to sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the bond of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such is the bond of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) And how is there the bond of existence?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one does not understand these things as they really are, then lust for existence, delight in existence, affection for existence, infatuation with existence, thirst for existence, passion for <a id="pg397"><span class="f2 g"><b>[397]</b></span></a> existence, attachment to existence, and craving for existence lie deep within one in regard to states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the bond of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such are the bond of sensuality and the bond of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) And how is there the bond of views?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to views.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one does not understand these things as they really are, <a id="pt11" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.010.pali.bd.htm#pg11"><span class="f2">[11]</span></a> then lust for views, delight in views, affection for views, infatuation with views, thirst for views, passion for views, attachment to views, and craving for views lie deep within one in regard to views.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the bond of views.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such are the bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, and the bond of views.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) And how is there the bond of ignorance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone does not understand as they really are the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to the six bases for contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one does not understand these things as they really are, then, ignorance and unknowing lie deep within one in regard to the six bases for contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the bond of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the bond of sensuality, the bond of existence, the bond of views, and the bond of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">"One is fettered by bad unwholesome states that are defiling, conducive to renewed existence, troublesome, ripening in suffering, leading to future birth, old age, and death; therefore one is said to be 'not secure from bondage.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, bhikkhus, these four severances of bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The severance of the bond of sensuality, the severance of the bond of existence, the severance of the bond of views, and the severance of the bond of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the severance of the bond of sensuality?</p>
