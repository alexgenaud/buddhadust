					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The person who goes along with the stream; the one who goes against the stream; the one who is inwardly firm; and the one who has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin who stands on high ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what is the person who goes along with the stream?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone indulges in sensual pleasures and performs bad deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person who goes along with the stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what is the person who goes against the stream?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, someone does not indulge in sensual pleasures or perform bad deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even with pain and dejection, weeping with a tearful face, he lives the complete and purified spiritual life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person who goes against the stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what is the person who is inwardly firm?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, some person is of spontaneous birth, due to attain final Nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person who is inwardly firm.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And what is the one who has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin who stands on high ground?</p>

					<p class="f4">[6] Here, with the destruction of the taints, some person has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person who has crossed over and gone beyond, the brahmin who stands on high ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of persons found existing in the world."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Those people who are uncontrolled in sense pleasures,<br />
							not rid of lust, enjoying sense pleasures here,<br />
							<a id="pg392"><span class="f2 g"><b>[392]</b></span></a> repeatedly coming back to birth and old age,<br />
							immersed in craving, are "the ones who go along with the stream."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore a wise person with mindfulness established,<br />
							not resorting to sense pleasures and bad deeds,<br />
							should give up sense pleasures even if it's painful:<br />
							they call this person "one who goes against the stream."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">One who has abandoned five defilements,<br />
							a fulfilled trainee, unable to retrogress,<br />
							attained to mind's mastery, his faculties composed:<br />
							this person is called "one inwardly firm."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">One who has comprehended things high and low,<br />
							burnt them up, so they're gone and exist no more:<br />
							that sage who has lived the spiritual life,<br />
							reached the world's end, is called<br />
							"one who has gone beyond."</p>
