					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was dwelling at Uruvelā, by the goatherds' banyan tree on the bank of the Neranjarā River, just after I had attained full enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, while I was alone in seclusion, a course of thought arose in my mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is painful to dwell without reverence and deference.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what ascetic or brahmin can I honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) 'If my aggregate of virtuous behavior were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in virtuous behavior than myself whom I could honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "'If my aggregate of concentration were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">However ... I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in concentration than myself....</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "'If my aggregate of wisdom were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">However ... I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in wisdom than myself....</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "'If my aggregate of liberation were incomplete, for the sake of completing it I would honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on another ascetic or brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more accomplished in liberation than myself whom I could honor, respect, and dwell in dependence on.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let me then honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on this Dhamma to which I have become fully enlightened.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Brahmā Sahampati, <a id="pt21" href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.021.pali.bd.htm#pg21"><span class="f2">[21]</span></a> having known with his own mind the reflection in my mind, disappeared from the Brahmā world and reappeared before me just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, bent down with his right knee on the ground, reverently saluted me, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So it is, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Fortunate One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, those who were the Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the past — those Blessed Ones, too, honored, respected, and dwelled in dependence only on the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who will be the Arahants, the Perfectly Enlightened Ones in the future — those Blessed Ones, too, will honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One, too, who is at present the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, honor, respect, and dwell in dependence only on the Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is what Brahmā Sahampati said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, he further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"'The perfect Buddhas of the past,<br />
							the Buddhas of the future,<br />
							and the present Buddha<br />
							who removes the sorrow of many:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">all those dwelled, now dwell,<br />
							and [in the future] will dwell<br />
							revering the good Dhamma.<br />
							This is the nature of the Buddhas.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"'Therefore one desiring the good,<br />
							aspiring for greatness,<br />
							should revere the good Dhamma,<br />
							recollecting the Buddhas' teaching."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This was what Brahmā Sahampati said.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then paid homage to me, and keeping me on his right, he disappeared right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having acknowledged Brahmā's request and what was proper for myself, I honored, respected, and dwelled in dependence only on the Dhamma to which I had become fully enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now that the Saŋghahas acquired greatness, I have respect for the  Saŋgha, too."</p>
