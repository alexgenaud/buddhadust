<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 31. Sumana, Raja Pasanadi's sister, has waited a long time to join the order as she first felt the need to take care of her grandmother. Before even she is initiated she becomes a non-returner and then an arahant. In this sutta she asks the Buddha about the results of making gifts." />

					<p class="f4">Then Princess Sumanā, accompanied by five hundred chariots and five hundred court girls, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Princess Sumanā then said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhante, there might be two disciples of the Blessed One equal in faith, virtuous behavior, and wisdom, but one is generous while the other is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the breakup of the body, <a id="pt33" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.031.pali.bd.htm#pg33"><span class="f2">[33]</span></a> after death, they would both be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they have become devas, would there be any distinction or difference between them."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There would be, Sumanā," the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The generous one, having become a deva, would surpass the other in five ways: in celestial life span, celestial beauty, celestial happiness, celestial glory, and celestial authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">The generous one, having become a deva, would surpass the other in these five ways."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhante, if these two pass away from there and again become human beings, would there still be some distinction or difference between them."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There would be, Sumanā," the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When they again become human beings, the generous one would surpass the other in five ways: in human life span, human beauty, human happiness, human fame, and human authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they again become human beings, the generous one would surpass the other in these five ways."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhante, if these two should go forth from the household life into homelessness, would there still be some distinction or difference between them."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There would be, Sumanā," the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The generous one, having gone forth, would surpass the other in five ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) He would usually use a robe that has been specifically offered to him, seldom one that had not been specifically offered to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He would usually eat almsfood that has been specifically offered to him, seldom almsfood that had not been specifically offered to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He would usually use a lodging that had been specifically offered to him, seldom one that had not been specifically offered to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) He would usually use medicinal requisites and [other] supports for the sick that had been specifically offered to him, seldom those that had not been specifically offered to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) His fellow monastics, those with whom he dwells, would usually behave toward him in agreeable ways by bodily, verbal, and mental action, seldom in disagreeable ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">They would usually present him what is agreeable, seldom <a id="pt34" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.031.pali.bd.htm#pg34"><span class="f2">[34]</span></a> what is disagreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">The generous one, having gone forth, would surpass the other in these five ways."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhante, if both attain arahantship, would there still be some distinction or difference between them after they have attained arahantship."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, Sumanā, I declare, there would be no difference between the liberation [of one] and the liberation [of the other]."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's astounding and amazing, bhante!</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly, one has good reason to give alms and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becomes a deva, [again] becomes a human being, or goes forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Sumanā!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Sumanā!</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly, one has good reason to give alms and do meritorious deeds, since they will be helpful if one becomes a deva, [again] becomes a human being, or goes forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"As the stainless moon<br />
							moving through the sphere of space<br />
							outshines with its radiance<br />
							all the stars in the world,<br />
							so one accomplished in virtuous behavior,<br />
							a person endowed with faith,<br />
							outshines by generosity<br />
							all the misers in the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"As the hundred-peaked rain cloud,<br />
							thundering, wreathed in lightning,<br />
							pours down rain upon the earth,<br />
							inundating the plains and lowlands,<br />
							so the Perfectly Enlightened One's disciple,<br />
							the wise one accomplished in vision,<br />
							surpasses the miserly person<br />
							in five specific respects:<br />
							life span and glory,<br />
							beauty and happiness.<br />
							Possessed of wealth, after death<br />
							he rejoices in heaven."</p>
