<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 7. The Buddha explains how when faith, sense of shame, fear-of-blame, energy and wisdom are not yet established as instinctive responses, a bhikkhu is one who has gone forth from faith. But when these things are established as instinctive responses, one is able to protect oneself." />

					<p class="f4">When a clansman has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, he can be described as a clansman who has gone forth out of faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual pleasures, whether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inferior sensual pleasures, middling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned simply as sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt6" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.007.pali.bd.htm#pg6"><span class="f2">[6]</span></a> "Suppose a young infant boy, ignorant, lying on his back, were to put a stick or pebble in his mouth because of his nurse's heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His nurse would quickly attend to him and try to take it out.</p>

					<p class="f4">If she could not quickly take it out, she would brace the boy's head with her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, she would take it out even if she had to draw blood.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">There would be some distress for the boy — this I don't deny — but the nurse has to do so for his good and welfare, out of compassion for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, the nurse would be unconcerned about him, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The boy can now look after himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">He won't be heedless.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in a sense of shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, and in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, I must still look after him.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when that bhikkhu is accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities ... accomplished in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, then I am unconcerned about him, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The bhikkhu can now look after himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">He won't be heedless.'"</p>
