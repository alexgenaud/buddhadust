The Buddha tells Anāthapiṇḍika, that long life, beauty, happiness, honor and rebirth in heaven hereafter is not to be got by prayers or wishing — one must walk the walk-to-walk ('patipada') to get these things." />

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, there are these five things that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Long life, householder, is wished for, desired, agreeable, and rarely gained in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beauty ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Happiness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Householder, the noble disciple who desires long life ought not to pray for long life or delight in it or [passively] yearn for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">A noble disciple who desires long life should practice the way conducive to long life. For when he practices the way conducive to long life, it leads to obtaining long life, and he gains long life either celestial or human.</p>
