<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 9. The Buddha explains how when in a disrespectful bhikkhu faith, sense of shame, fear-of-blame, energy and wisdom are lacking he is subject to falling away. But possessing these things he does not fall away." />
