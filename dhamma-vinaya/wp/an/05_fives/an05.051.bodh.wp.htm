<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 51. The Buddha likens a person mastered by wishing for sense pleasure, hate, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling, and doubt and vacillation (the Nivaranas — diversions) to a stream which has been diverted and no longer has it's original strength or free will. Then he likens a person who has mastered desire for sense pleasures, hatred, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling and doubt and vacillation to a stream whose diversions have been closed off and which has regained its strength and free will." />

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Sensual desire is an obstruction, a hindrance, an encumbrance of the mind, a state that weakens wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) Ill will ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) Dullness and drowsiness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) Restlessness and remorse ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) Doubt is an obstruction, a hindrance, an encumbrance of the mind, a state that weakens wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, without having abandoned these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom, it is impossible that a bhikkhu, with his powerless and feeble wisdom, might know his own good, the good of others, <a id="pt64" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.051.pali.bd.htm#pg64"><span class="f2">[64]</span></a> or the good of both, or realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a river was flowing down from a mountain, traveling a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on both of its banks, a man would open irrigation channels.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a case, the current in the middle of the river would be dispersed, spread out, and divided, so that the river would no longer travel a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, without having abandoned these five obstructions ... it is impossible that a bhikkhu ... might realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, bhikkhus, having abandoned these five obstructions, hindrances, encumbrances of the mind, states that weaken wisdom, it is possible that a bhikkhu, with his powerful wisdom, might know his own good, the good of others, and the good of both, and realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a river was flowing down from a mountain, traveling a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man would close up the irrigation channels on both of its banks.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a case, the current in the middle of the river would not be dispersed, spread out, and divided, so that the river could travel a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, having abandoned these five obstructions ... it is possible that a bhikkhu ... might realize a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones."</p>
