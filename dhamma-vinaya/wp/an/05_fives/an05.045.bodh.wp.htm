					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"(1) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a robe [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using almsfood [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a dwelling [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using a bed and chair [that one has given him], one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads ... to one's welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) When a bhikkhu enters and dwells in a measureless concentration of mind while using medicinal requisites and [other] supports for the sick [that one has given him], <a id="pt52" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.045.pali.bd.htm#pg52"><span class="f2">[52]</span></a> one acquires a measureless stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, a nutriment of happiness ... that leads to one's welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, nutriments of happiness — heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven — that lead to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one's welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit, streams of the wholesome, it is not easy to measure his merit thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just so much is his stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness — heavenly ... that leads to ... one's welfare and happiness'; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to measure the water in the great ocean thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many thousands of gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, when a noble disciple possesses these five streams of merit ... it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Just as the many rivers used by the hosts of people,<br />
							flowing downstream, reach the ocean,<br />
							the great mass of water, the boundless sea,<br />
							the fearsome receptacle of heaps of gems;<br />
							<a id="pt53" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.045.pali.bd.htm#pg53"><span class="f2">[53]</span></a> so the streams of merit reach the wise man<br />
							who is a giver of food, drink, and cloth;<br />
							[they reach] the donor of beds, seats, and covers<br />
							like rivers carrying their waters to the sea."</p>
