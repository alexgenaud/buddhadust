					<p class="f4">This is the second favorable occasion for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Again, food is plentiful; there has been a good harvest <a id="pt67" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.054.pali.bd.htm#pg67"><span class="f2">[67]</span></a> and almsfood is abundant, so that one can easily sustain oneself by means of gleaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third favorable occasion for striving.</p>
