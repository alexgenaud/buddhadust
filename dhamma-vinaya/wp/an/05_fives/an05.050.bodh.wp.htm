					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion King Muṇḍa's [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who had been dear and beloved to him, had died.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since her death, he did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Day and night, he remained brooding over Queen Bhaddā'sbody.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, friend Piyaka, <a id="pt58" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.050.pali.bd.htm#pg58"><span class="f2">[58]</span></a> immerse Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclose it in another iron vat so that we can see Queen Bhaddā's body still longer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire," the treasurer Piyaka replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he immersed Queen Bhaddā's body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclosed it in another iron vat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the treasurer Piyaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"King Muṇḍa's [wife] Queen Bhaddā has died, and she was dear and beloved to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since her death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ascetic or brahmin can King Muṇḍa visit, so that, having heard his Dhamma, he might abandon the dart of sorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to Piyaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Paṭaliputte, in the Cock's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, an artful speaker, eloquent, mature, and an arahant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose King Muṇḍa would visit the Venerable Nārada: perhaps if he hears the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, he would abandon the dart of sorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the treasurer Piyaka approached King Muṇḍa and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, the Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Paṭaliputte, in the Cock's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is wise ... and an arahant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Your majesty should visit the Venerable Nārada.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps, when you hear the Venerable Nārada's Dhamma, you would abandon the dart of sorrow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[The king said:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, friend Piyaka, <a id="pt59" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.050.pali.bd.htm#pg59"><span class="f2">[59]</span></a> inform the Venerable Nārada.</p>

					<p class="f4">For how can one like me think of approaching an ascetic or brahmin living in his realm without first informing him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire," Piyaka replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he went to the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, King Muṇḍa's [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who was dear and beloved to him has died.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since the queen's death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen's body.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, bhante, if the Venerable Nārada would teach the Dhamma to King Muṇḍa in such a way that he can abandon the dart of sorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let King Muṇḍa come at his own convenience."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the treasurer Piyaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Venerable Nārada, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to King Muṇḍa.</p>

					<p class="f4">He told the king:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, the Venerable Nārada has given his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may go at your own convenience."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, friend Piyaka, get the finest carriages harnessed!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire," Piyaka replied, and after he had gotten the finest carriages harnessed he told King Muṇḍa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, the finest carriages have been harnessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may go at your own convenience."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage, and along with the other carriages he set out in full royal splendor for the Cock's Park to see the Venerable Nārada.</p>

					<p class="f4">He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot.</p>

					<p class="f4">He approached the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt60" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.050.pali.bd.htm#pg60"><span class="f2">[60]</span></a> The Venerable Nārada then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, orBrahmā, or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) 'May what is subject to old age not grow old!':</p>

					<p class="f4">this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, orBrahmā, or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) 'May what is subject to illness not fall ill!':</p>

					<p class="f4">this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic ... or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) 'May what is subject to death not die!':</p>

					<p class="f4">this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic ... or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) 'May what is subject to destruction not be destroyed!':</p>

					<p class="f4">this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic ... or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) 'May what is subject to loss not be lost!':</p>

					<p class="f4">this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, orBrahmā, or by anyone in the world....</p>

					<p class="f4">[The sequel is identical to <a href="an05.048.bodh.wp.htm">5:48,</a> including the verses.] ...</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, King Muṇḍa asked the Venerable Nārada:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, what is the name of this exposition of the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, this exposition of the Dhamma is named the extraction of the dart of sorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, bhante, it is the extraction of the dart of sorrow!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, it is the extraction of the dart of sorrow, for having heard this exposition of the Dhamma, I have abandoned the dart of sorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Muṇḍa said to the treasurer Piyaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, friend Piyaka, have Queen Bhaddā's body cremated and build a memorial mound for her.</p>

					<p class="f4">From today on, I will bathe and anoint myself and eat my meals and undertake my work."</p>
