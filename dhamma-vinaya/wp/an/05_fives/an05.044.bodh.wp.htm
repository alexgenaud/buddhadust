					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat down in the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder Ugga of Vesālī approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, my sal flower porridge is agreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, my pork embellished with jujubes is agreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, my fried vegetable stalks are agreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept them from me, out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, my boiled hill rice cleared of dark grains, accompanied by various sauces and condiments, is agreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt50" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.044.pali.bd.htm#pg50"><span class="f2">[50]</span></a> "Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, my Kāsi cloths are agreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept them from me, out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The giver of what is agreeable gains what is agreeable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhante, my couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy above and red bolsters at both ends, is agreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Although I know this is not allowable for the Blessed One, this sandalwood plank of mine is worth over a thousand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept it from me, out of compassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One accepted, out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One expressed his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesālī thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable,<br />
							when he gives willingly to the upright ones<br />
							clothing, bedding, food, and drink,<br />
							and various kinds of requisites.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Having known the arahants to be like a field<br />
							for what is relinquished and offered, not held back,<br />
							the good person gives what is hard to give:<br />
							the giver of agreeable things gains what is agreeable."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, after expressing his appreciation to the householder Ugga of Vesālī, the Blessed One rose from his seat and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, some time later, the householder Ugga of Vesālī passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his death, the householder Ugga of Vesālī was reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities].</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Ugga, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire <a id="pt51" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.044.pali.bd.htm#pg51"><span class="f2">[51]</span></a> Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, Ugga, that it is as you would have wished."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, bhante, it is as I had wished."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the young deva Ugga with verses:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"The giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable;<br />
							the giver of the foremost again gains the foremost;<br />
							the giver of the excellent gains the excellent;<br />
							the giver of the best reaches the best state.</p>

							<p class="f4">"The person who gives the best,<br />
							the giver of the foremost,<br />
							the giver of the excellent,<br />
							is long-lived and famous<br />
							wherever he is reborn."</p>
