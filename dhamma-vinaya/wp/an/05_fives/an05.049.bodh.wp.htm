					Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the
					Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Now on that
					occasion Queen Mallikā had just died.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man approached King
					Pasendi and whispered in his ear:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, Queen Mallikā has just died."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, King Pasenadi was pained and saddened, and he sat
					there with slumping shoulders, facing downwards, glum, and speechless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, having known the king's condition, said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Great king, there are these five situations that are unobtainable
					by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in
					the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) 'May what is subject to old age not grow old!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, orBrahmā, or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) 'May what is subject to illness not fall ill!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic ... or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) 'May what is subject to death not die!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic ... or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) 'May what is subject to destruction not be destroyed!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic ... or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) 'May what is subject to loss not be lost!': this is a situation that is unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, orBrahmā, or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Great king, for the uninstructed worldling, what is subject to old age grows old.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens, he does not reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to old age grows old.</p>

					<p class="f4">For all beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to old age grows old.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to old age grows old, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, when what is subject to old age grows old, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called an uninstructed worldling pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow who only torments himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, for the uninstructed worldling, what is subject to illness falls ill ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) ... what is subject to death dies ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) ... what is subject to destruction is destroyed ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) ... what is subject to loss is lost.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens, he does not reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not the only one for whom what is subject to loss is lost.</p>

					<p class="f4">For all beings who come and go, who pass away and undergo rebirth, what is subject to loss is lost.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to sorrow, languish, lament, weep beating my breast, and become confused when what is subject to loss is lost, I would lose my appetite and my features would become ugly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would not be able to do my work, my enemies would be elated, and my friends would become saddened.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, when what is subject to loss is lost, he sorrows, languishes, laments, weeps beating his breast, and becomes confused.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called an uninstructed worldling pierced by the poisonous dart of sorrow who only torments himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Great king, for the instructed noble disciple, what is subject to old age grows old.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called an instructed noble disciple who has drawn out the poisonous dart of sorrow pierced by which the uninstructed worldling only torments himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sorrowless, without darts, the noble disciple realizes Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, for the instructed noble disciple, what is subject to illness falls ill ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) ... what is subject to death dies ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, Great king, are the five situations that are unobtainable by an ascetic or a brahmin, by a deva, Māra, or Brahmā, or by anyone in the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"It is not by sorrowing and lamenting<br />
							that even the least good here can be gained.<br />
							Knowing that one is sorrowful and sad,<br />
							one's enemies are elated.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"When the wise person does not shake in adversities,<br />
							knowing how to determine what is good,<br />
							his enemies are saddened, having seen<br />
							that his former facial expression does not change.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Wherever one might gain one's good,
							in whatever way — by chanting, mantras,<br />
							maxims, gifts, or tradition — there<br />
							one should exert oneself in just that way.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"But if one should understand: 'This good<br />
							cannot be obtained by me or anyone else,'<br />
							one should accept the situation without sorrowing,<br />
							thinking: 'The kamma is strong; what can I do now?"</p>
