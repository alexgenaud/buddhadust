<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 11. The Buddha claims to have discovered and mastered things that had not been heard of before. He then states that faith, sense of shame, fear-of-blame, energy and wisdom are Powers of one who has 'got it' and that it is because he possesses these Powers, of those who have 'got it', he claims the place of chief." />
