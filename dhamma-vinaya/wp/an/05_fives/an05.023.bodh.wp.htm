					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Iron, copper, tin, lead, and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five defilements of gold, defiled by which gold is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly fit for work.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when gold is freed from these five defilements, it is malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly fit for work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then whatever kind of ornament one wishes to make from it — whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland — one can achieve one's purpose.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but brittle and not properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the mind is freed from these five defilements, it becomes malleable, wieldy, <a id="pt17" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.023.pali.bd.htm#pg17"><span class="f2">[17]</span></a> and luminous, pliant and properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, there being a suitable basis, one is capable of realizing any state realizable by direct knowledge toward which one might incline the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I wield the various kinds of psychic potency:</p>

					<p class="f4">having been one, may I become many;</p>

					<p class="f4">having been many, may I become one;</p>

					<p class="f4">may I appear and vanish;</p>

					<p class="f4">may I go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space;</p>

					<p class="f4">may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were water;</p>

					<p class="f4">may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth;</p>

					<p class="f4">seated cross-legged, may I travel in space like a bird;</p>

					<p class="f4">with my hand may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty;</p>

					<p class="f4">may I exercise mastery with the body as far as the Brahmā world,'</p>

					<p class="f4">one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near,'</p>

					<p class="f4">one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with my own mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust,<br />
					and a mind without lust as a mind without lust;<br />
					<a id="pt18" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.023.pali.bd.htm#pg18"><span class="f2">[18]</span></a> a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred,<br />
					and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred;<br />

					a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted;<br />
					an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted;<br />
					a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable;<br />
					a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated;<br />
					a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated,'</p>

					<p class="f4">one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I recollect my manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span;<br />
					passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span;<br />
					passing away from there, I was reborn here." —</p>

					<p class="f4">may I thus recollect my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details,'</p>

					<p class="f4">one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt19" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.023.pali.bd.htm#pg19"><span class="f2">[19]</span></a> "If one wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their kamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell;<br />
					but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly worl." —</p>

					<p class="f4">thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, may I see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their kamma,'</p>

					<p class="f4">one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I, with the destruction of the taints, in this very life realize for myself with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, may I dwell in it,'</p>

					<p class="f4">one is capable of realizing it, there being a suitable basis."</p>
