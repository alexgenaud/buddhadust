<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 57. The Buddha urges everyone interested in their own salvation to give contemplation to aging, being subject to sickness and death, changeability and separation from the things we love, and the idea that one's deeds return to one in kind. He further explains why it is important to think of these things and the way to think of these things that will bring about escape from them." />

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect <a id="pt72" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.057.pali.bd.htm#pg72"><span class="f2">[72]</span></a> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "For the sake of what benefit, bhikkhus, should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age'?</p>

					<p class="f4">In their youth beings are intoxicated with their youth, and when they are intoxicated with their youth they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with youth is either completely abandoned or diminished.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness'?</p>

					<p class="f4">In a state of health beings are intoxicated with their health, and when they are intoxicated with their health they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with health is either completely abandoned or diminished.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death'?</p>

					<p class="f4">During their lives beings are intoxicated with life, and when they are intoxicated with life they engage in misconduct by body, speech, <a id="pt73" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.057.pali.bd.htm#pg73"><span class="f2">[73]</span></a> and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with life is either completely abandoned or diminished.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Beings have desire and lust in regard to those people and things that are dear and agreeable, and excited by this lust, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when one often reflects upon this theme, the desire and lust in regard to everyone and everything dear and agreeable is either completely abandoned or diminished.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do'?</p>

					<p class="f4">People engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, such misconduct is either completely abandoned or diminished.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Worldlings subject to illness,<br />
							old age and death, are disgusted<br />
							[by other people] who exist<br />
							in accordance with their nature.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"If I were to become disgusted<br />

							having seen security in renunciation.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Zeal then arose in me<br />
