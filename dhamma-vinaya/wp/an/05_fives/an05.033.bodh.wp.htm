					<p class="f4">Then Uggaha, Meṇḍaka's grandson, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, let the Blessed One together with three other monks consent to accept tomorrow's <a id="pt37" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.033.pali.bd.htm#pg37"><span class="f2">[37]</span></a> meal from me."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Uggaha, having understood that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night had passed, in the morning the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to Uggaha's residence, where he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with his own hands, Uggaha, Meṇḍaka's grandson, served and satisfied the Blessed One with various kinds of delicious food.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Uggaha sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, these girls of mine will be going to their husbands' families.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One exhort them and instruct them in a way that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to those girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "So then, girls, you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To whichever husband our parents give us — doing so out of a desire for our good, seeking our welfare, taking compassion on us, acting out of compassion for us — we will rise before him and retire after him, undertaking whatever needs to be done, agreeable in our conduct and pleasing in our speech.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will honor, respect, esteem, and venerate those whom our husband respects — his mother and father, ascetics and brahmins — and when they arrive we will offer them a seat and water.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will be skillful and diligent in attending to our husband's domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; we will possess sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will find out what our husband's domestic helpers — whether slaves, messengers, or <a id="pt38" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.033.pali.bd.htm#pg38"><span class="f2">[38]</span></a> workers — have done and left undone; we will find out the condition of those who are ill; and we will distribute to each an appropriate portion of food.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "And you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will guard and protect whatever income our husband brings home — whether money or grain, silver or gold — and we will not be spendthrifts, thieves, wastrels, or squanderers of his earnings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus should you train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, girls, a woman possesses these five qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied devas."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">She does not despise her husband,<br />
							the man who constantly supports her,<br />
							who ardently and eagerly<br />
							always brings her whatever she wants.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Nor does a good woman scold her husband<br />
							with speech caused by jealousy;<br />
							the wise woman shows veneration<br />
							to all those whom her husband reveres.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">She rises early, works diligently,<br />
							manages the domestic help;<br />
							she treats her husband in agreeable ways<br />
							and safeguards the wealth he earns.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The woman who fulfills her duties thus,<br />
							following her husband's will and wishes,<br />
							is reborn among the devas<br />
							called "the agreeable ones."</p>
