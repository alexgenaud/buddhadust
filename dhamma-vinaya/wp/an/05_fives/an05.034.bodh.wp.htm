					<p class="f4">Then Sīha the general approached <a id="pt39" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.034.pali.bd.htm#pg39"><span class="f2">[39]</span></a> the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it possible, bhante, to point out a directly visible fruit of giving."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, Sīha," the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "A donor, Sīha, a munificent giver, is dear and agreeable to many people.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, good persons resort to a donor, a munificent giver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Again, a donor, a munificent giver, acquires a good reputation.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "Again, whatever assembly a donor, a munificent giver, approaches — whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics — he approaches it confidently and composed. This too is a directly visible fruit of giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "Again, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a fruit of giving pertaining to future lives."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning those four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">I know them, too.</p>

					<p class="f4">For I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I am dear and agreeable to many people.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am a donor, a munificent giver, and many good persons resort to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am a donor, a munificent giver, and I have acquired a good reputation as a donor, sponsor, and supporter of the  Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">I <a id="pt40" href="../../../pali/an/05_fives/an05.034.pali.bd.htm#pg40"><span class="f2">[40]</span></a> am a donor, a munificent giver, and whatever assembly I approach — whether of khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or ascetics — I approach it confidently and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not go by faith in the Blessed One concerning these four directly visible fruits of giving declared by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">I know them, too.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the Blessed One tells me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sīha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not know this, and here I go by faith in the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Sīha, so it is!</p>

					<p class="f4">With the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a munificent giver, is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">By giving, he becomes dear and many resort to him.<br />
							He attains a good reputation and his fame increases.<br />
							The generous man is composed<br />
							and confidently enters the assembly.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore, seeking happiness,<br />
							wise persons give gifts,<br />
							having removed the stain of miserliness.<br />
							When they are settled in the triple heaven,<br />
							for a long time they delight<br />
							in companionship with the devas.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Having taken the opportunity to do wholesome deeds,<br />
							passing from here, self-luminous, they roam in Nandana,<br />
							where they delight, rejoice, and enjoy themselves,<br />
							furnished with the five objects of sensual pleasure.<br />
							Having fulfilled the word of the unattached Stable One,<br />
							the Fortunate One's disciples rejoice in heaven.</p>
