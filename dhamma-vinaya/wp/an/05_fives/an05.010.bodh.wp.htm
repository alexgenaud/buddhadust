<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Fives, Sutta 10. The Buddha explains how when in a disrespectful bhikkhu faith, sense of shame, fear-of-blame, energy and wisdom are lacking he is incapable of progress in this Dhamma. But possessing these things he is capable of progress." />
