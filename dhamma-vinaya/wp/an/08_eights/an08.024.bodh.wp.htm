The lay follower Hatthaka of Alavi describes how he has managed to gather together a great following using the Buddha's four methods for creating alliances; the Buddha then praises Hatthaka as having eight wonders associated with him." />

					<p class="f4">Then Hatthaka of Āḷavī, accompanied by five hundred lay followers, <a id="pt219" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.024.pali.bd.htm#pg219"><span class="f2">[219]</span></a> approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your retinue is large, Hatthaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">How do you sustain this large retinue."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do so, bhante, by the four means of attracting and sustaining others taught by the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This one is to be attracted and sustained by a gift,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I attract and sustain him by a gift.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This one is to be attracted and sustained by endearing speech,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I attract and sustain him by endearing speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This one is to be attracted and sustained by beneficent conduct,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I attract and sustain him by beneficent conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This one is to be attracted and sustained by impartiality,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I attract and sustain him by impartiality.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is wealth in my family, bhante.</p>

					<p class="f4">They don't think they should listen to me as if I were poor."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, Hatthaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the method by which you can attract and sustain a large retinue.</p>

					<p class="f4">For all those in the past who attracted and sustained a large retinue did so by these same four means of attracting and sustaining others.</p>

					<p class="f4">All those in the future who will attract and sustain a large retinue will do so by these same four means of attracting and sustaining others.</p>

					<p class="f4">And all those at present who attract and sustain a large retinue do so by these same four means of attracting and sustaining others."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, after the Blessed One had instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Hatthaka of Āḷavī with a Dhamma talk, Hatthaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, <a id="pt220" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.024.pali.bd.htm#pg220"><span class="f2">[220]</span></a> and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after Hatthaka of Āḷavī had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, you should remember Hatthaka of Āḷavī as one who possesses eight astounding and amazing qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) He is endowed with faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He is virtuous, and (3) has a sense of moral shame and (4) moral dread.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) He is learned, (6) generous, and (7) wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) He has few desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should remember Hatthaka of Āḷavī as one who possesses these eight astounding and amazing qualities."</p>
