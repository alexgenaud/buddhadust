<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Eights, Sutta 40. Eight things which becoming habitual lead to rebirth in Hell, as an animal, as a ghost, as a deamon and here as a human lead to short life, loss of wealth, being hated, being slandered and accused falsely, breaking-up of friendships, hearing unpleasant sounds, hearing unpleasant speech, and going mad." />
