					<p class="f4">Then the male lay follower Vāseṭṭha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vāseṭṭha, observed complete in eight factors, the <i>uposatha</i> is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive ...</p>

					<p class="f4">If all brahmins ... vessas ... suddas would observe the <i>uposatha</i> complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these great sal trees would observe the <i>uposatha</i> complete in eight factors, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of these great sal trees for a long time, [if they could choose].</p>

					<p class="f4">How much more then for a human being!" </p>
