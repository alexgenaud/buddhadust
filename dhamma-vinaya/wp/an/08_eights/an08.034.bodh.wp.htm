							the yield of grain is excellent.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Its health is excellent;<br />
							its growth [too] is excellent;<br />
							its maturation is excellent;<br />
							its fruit truly is excellent.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">So too when one gives excellent food<br />
							to those accomplished in virtuous behavior,<br />
							it arrives at several kinds of excellence,<br />
							for what one has done is excellent.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore if one desires excellence<br />
							let a person here be accomplished;<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">One accomplished in true knowledge and conduct,<br />
							having gained accomplishment of mind,<br />
							performs action that is accomplished<br />
							and accomplishes the good.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Having known the world as it is,<br />
