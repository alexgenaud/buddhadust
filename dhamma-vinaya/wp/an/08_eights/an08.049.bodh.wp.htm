					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.049.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.049.hare.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visāka Migāramātā approached the Blessed One ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to her:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Visāka, possessing four qualities, a woman is heading for victory in the present world and her life in this world succeeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman is capable at her work; she manages the domestic help; she behaves agreeably to her husband; and she safeguards his earnings.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And how, Visāka, is a woman capable at her work?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman is skillful and diligent in attending to her husband's domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; she possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman <a id="pt270" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.049.pali.bd.htm#pg270"><span class="f2">[270]</span></a> is capable at her work.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how does a woman manage the domestic help?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman finds out what her husband's domestic helpers — whether slaves, messengers, or workers — have done and left undone; she finds out the condition of those who are ill; and she distributes to each an appropriate portion of food. It is in this way that a woman manages the domestic help.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And how does a woman behave agreeably to her husband? Here, a woman would not commit any misdeed that her husband would consider disagreeable, even at the cost of her life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman behaves agreeably to her husband.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And how does a woman safeguard his earnings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman guards and protects whatever income her husband brings home — whether money or grain, silver or gold — and she is not a spendthrift, thief, wastrel, or squanderer of his earnings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman safeguards his earnings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessing these four qualities, a woman is heading for victory in the present world and her life in this world succeeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessing four [other] qualities, Visāka, a woman is heading for victory in the other world and her life in the other world succeeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman is accomplished in faith, accomplished in virtuous behavior, accomplished in generosity, and accomplished in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "And how, Visāka, is a woman accomplished in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman is endowed with faith. She places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "And how is a woman accomplished in virtuous behavior?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt271" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.049.pali.bd.htm#pg271"><span class="f2">[271]</span></a> Here, a woman abstains from the destruction of life ... from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in virtuous behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "And how is a woman accomplished in generosity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in generosity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "And how is a woman accomplished in wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a woman is wise; she possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a woman is accomplished in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessing these four qualities, Visāka, a woman is heading for victory in the other world and her life in the other world succeeds."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Capable in attending to her work,<br />
							managing the domestic help,<br />
							she treats her husband in agreeable ways<br />
							and safeguards the wealth he earns.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Rich in faith, possessed of virtue,<br />
							charitable and devoid of miserliness,<br />
							she constantly purifies the path<br />
							that leads to safety in the future life.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They call any woman<br />
							who has these eight qualities,<br />
							virtuous, firm in Dhamma,<br />
							a speaker of truth.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Accomplished in sixteen aspects,<br />
							complete in eight factors,<br />
							such a virtuous female lay follower<br />
							is reborn in an agreeable deva world.</p>
