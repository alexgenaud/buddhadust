					<p class="f4">"Yes, bhante," those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, bhikkhus, are the eight kinds of wild colts and the eight faults of a horse?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Here, when a wild colt is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, when a wild colt is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go forward!'</p>

					<p class="f4">and is being spurred and incited by its trainer, it leaps back and [thereby] damages the rail and breaks the triple rod.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Again, when a wild colt is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What right does an incompetent fool like you have to speak?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you really think you have something to say?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told:</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he attributes an offense to the reprover himself, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have committed such and such an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Make amends for it first.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third fault of a person.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he answers evasively, diverts the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displays anger, hatred, and bitterness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go forward!'</p>

					<p class="f4">and when spurred and incited by its trainer, takes a wrong path and leads the chariot off the track.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth fault of a person.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he speaks while waving his arms about in the midst of the Saṅgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say this person is similar to <a id="pt194" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.014.pali.bd.htm#pg194"><span class="f2">[194]</span></a> the wild colt that, when told:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth fault of a person.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "Again, when the bhikkhus are reproving a bhikkhu for an offense, he does not heed the Saṅgha or his reprover but sets out wherever he wishes while still bearing his offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I committed an offense,'</p>

					<p class="f4">nor does he say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not commit an offense,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but he vexes the Saṅgha by keeping silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go forward!'</p>

					<p class="f4">and when spurred and incited by its trainer, does not go forward or turn back but stands right there as still as a post.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why are you making such a fuss about me?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I'll reject the training and return to the lower life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He then rejects the training, returns to the lower life, and declares:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now you can be satisfied!'</p>

					<p class="f4">I say this person is similar to the wild colt that, when told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go forward!'</p>
