					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, (1) a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is well born on both sides, maternal and paternal; he is born in whatever area other excellent thoroughbred horses are born.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He respectfully eats whatever food they give him, whether moist or dry, without scattering it.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He is repelled by sitting down or lying down near feces or urine.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) He is mild <a id="pt189" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.013.pali.bd.htm#pg189"><span class="f2">[189]</span></a> and pleasant to live with, and he does not agitate other horses.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) He reveals his tricks, ploys, gambits, and wiles as they really are to his trainer so that his trainer can make an effort to stamp them out of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) He carries loads, determined:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether or not the other horses carry loads, I myself will carry them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) When moving, he moves only along a straight path.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) He is strong, and he shows his strength right up until the end of his life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these eight factors, a king's excellent thoroughbred horse is worthy of a king, an accessory of a king, and reckoned as a factor of kingship.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, possessing eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) He respectfully eats whatever food they give him, whether coarse or excellent, without being annoyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He is repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; he is repelled by the acquisition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) He is mild and pleasant to live with, and he does not agitate other bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) He reveals his tricks, <a id="pt190" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.013.pali.bd.htm#pg190"><span class="f2">[190]</span></a> ploys, gambits, and wiles as they really are to the Teacher or to his wise fellow monks so that they can make an effort to stamp them out of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) He is one who takes up the training, determined:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether or not other bhikkhus train, I will train.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) When moving, he moves only along a straight path.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connection, this is the straight path: right view ... right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) He has aroused energy thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing these eight qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts ... an unsurpassed field of merit for the world."</p>
