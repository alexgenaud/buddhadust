					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, a certain bhikkhu dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavī.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he arrived, he sat down on the seat that was prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Hatthaka of Āḷavī approached the bhikkhu, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The bhikkhu then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, the Blessed One declared that you possess seven astounding and amazing qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is virtuous and has a sense of moral shame and moral dread.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is learned, generous, and wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, bhante, that no white-robed layman was present."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend. No white-robed layman was present."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's good, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that bhikkhu, having received almsfood at the residence of Hatthaka of Āḷavī, rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he approached the Blessed One, <a id="pt218" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.023.pali.bd.htm#pg218"><span class="f2">[218]</span></a> paid homage to him, sat down to one side, [and reported to him all that had happened].</p>
