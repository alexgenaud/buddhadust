					      <p class="f4 in2">One should not kill living beings or take what is not given;<br />
							one should not speak falsehood or drink intoxicants;<br />
							one should refrain from sexual activity, from unchastity;<br />
							one should not eat at night or outside the prescribed time.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">One should not wear garlands or apply scents;<br />
							one should sleep on a [low] bed or a mat on the ground;<br />
							this, they say, is the eight-factored <i>uposatha</i><br />
							proclaimed by the Buddha,<br />
							who reached the end of suffering.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">As far as the sun and moon revolve,<br />
							shedding light, so beautiful to gaze upon,<br />
							dispellers of darkness, moving through the firmament,<br />
							they shine in the sky, brightening up the quarters.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt255" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.042.pali.bd.htm#pg255"><span class="f2">[255]</span></a> Whatever wealth exists within this sphere —<br />
							pearls, gems, and beryl, an excellent stone,<br />
							siŋgī gold or [natural mountain] gold,<br />
							and the gold called haṭaka —<br />
							those are not worth a sixteenth part<br />
							of an <i>uposatha</i> complete in the eight factors,<br />
							just as all the hosts of stars<br />
							[do not match] the moon's radiance.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore a virtuous woman or man,<br />
							having observed the <i>uposatha</i> complete in eight factors<br />
							and having made merit productive of happiness,<br />
							blameless goes to a heavenly state.</p>
