The Buddha praises the way Nananda, who is of a lustful nature, manages to live the spiritual life in purity by way of his practice of garding the senses, moderation in eating, wakefulness, and minding and self-awareness." />

					<p class="f4">How else could Nanda lead the complete and pure spiritual life unless (5) he guarded the doors of the sense faculties, (6) observed moderation in eating, (7) was intent on wakefulness, and (8) possessed mindfulness and clear comprehension?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, this is how Nanda guards the doors of the sense faculties:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt167" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.009.pali.bd.htm#pg167"><span class="f2">[167]</span></a> If he needs to look to the east, he does so after he has fully considered the matter and clearly comprehends it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I look to the east, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection will not flow in upon me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he needs to look to the west ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to the north ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to the south ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to look up ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to look down ...</p>

					<p class="f4">to survey the intermediate directions, he does so after he has fully considered the matter and clearly comprehends it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I look to the intermediate directions, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection will not flow in upon me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how Nanda guards the doors of the sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how Nanda observes moderation in eating:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, reflecting carefully, Nanda consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how Nanda observes moderation in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how Nanda is intent on wakefulness:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt168" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.009.pali.bd.htm#pg168"><span class="f2">[168]</span></a> During the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, Nanda purifies his mind of obstructive qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising.</p>

					<p class="f4">After rising, in the last watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how Nanda is intent on wakefulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's mindfulness and clear comprehension:</p>

					<p class="f4">Nanda knows feelings as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; he knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear; he knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain present, as they disappear.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is Nanda's mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>

					<p class="f4">"How else, bhikkhus, could Nanda lead the complete and pure spiritual life unless he guarded the doors of the sense faculties, observed moderation in eating, was intent on wakefulness, and possessed mindfulness and clear comprehension?"</p>
