					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.046.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.046.hare.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambīin Ghosita's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Venerable Anuruddha had gone off to pass the day and was in seclusion when a number of agreeable-bodied deities approached him, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante Anuruddha, we <a id="pt263" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.046.pali.bd.htm#pg263"><span class="f2">[263]</span></a> agreeable-bodied deities exert mastery and exercise control over three things.</p>

					<p class="f4">We immediately acquire whatever color we want.</p>

					<p class="f4">We immediately acquire whatever pleasure we want.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we immediately acquire whatever voice we want.</p>

					<p class="f4">We agreeable-bodied deities exert mastery and exercise control over these three things."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Anuruddha thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May all these deities become blue, of blue complexion, with blue clothes and blue ornaments."</p>

					<p class="f4">Having known the Venerable Anuruddha's thought, those deities all became blue, of blue complexion, with blue clothes and blue ornaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Anuruddha thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May all these deities become yellow ... red ... white, of white complexion, with white clothes and white ornaments."</p>

					<p class="f4">Having known the Venerable Anuruddha's thought, those deities all became white, of white complexion, with white clothes and white ornaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, when a musical quintet is well trained and its rhythm well coordinated, and it is composed of skilled musicians, its music is exquisite, tantalizing, lovely, captivating, and intoxicating, <a id="pt264" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.046.pali.bd.htm#pg264"><span class="f2">[264]</span></a> just so those deities' performance was exquisite, tantalizing, lovely, captivating, and intoxicating.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Venerable Anuruddha drew in his sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those deities, [thinking:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Anuruddha is not enjoying [this],"</p>

					<p class="f4">disappeared right on the spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the evening, the Venerable Anuruddha emerged from seclusion and approached the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhante, I had gone off to pass the day and was in seclusion ... [he reports everything that happened down to] <a id="pt265" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.046.pali.bd.htm#pg265"><span class="f2">[265]</span></a> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those deities, [thinking:] 'Master Anuruddha is not enjoying [this],'</p>

					<p class="f4">disappeared right on the spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, how many qualities should a woman possess so that, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If she possesses eight qualities, Anuruddha, a woman, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Here, Anuruddha, to whichever husband her parents give her — doing so out of a desire for her good, seeking her welfare, taking compassion on her, acting out of compassion for her — a woman rises before him and retires after him, undertaking whatever needs to be done, agreeable in her conduct and pleasing in her speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "She honors, respects, esteems, and venerates those whom her husband respects — his mother and father, ascetics and brahmins — and when they arrive she offers them a seat and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "She is skillful and diligent in attending to her husband's domestic chores, whether knitting or weaving; she possesses sound judgment about them in order to carry out and arrange them properly.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "She finds out what her husband's domestic helpers <a id="pt266" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.046.pali.bd.htm#pg266"><span class="f2">[266]</span></a> — whether slaves, messengers, or workers — have done and left undone; she finds out the condition of those who are ill; and she distributes to each an appropriate portion of food.</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "She guards and protects whatever income her husband brings home —  whether money, grain, silver or gold — and she is not a spendthrift, thief, wastrel, or squanderer of his earnings.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "She is a female lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the  Saṅgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "She is virtuous, abstaining from the destruction of life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "She is generous, one who dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessing these eight qualities, Anuruddha, a woman, with the breakup of the body, after death, is reborn in companionship with the agreeable-bodied deities."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">She does not despise her husband,<br />
							the man who constantly supports her,<br />
							who ardently and eagerly<br />
							always brings her whatever she wants.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Nor does a good woman scold her husband<br />
							with speech caused by jealousy;<br />
							the wise woman shows veneration<br />
							to all those whom her husband reveres.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">She rises early, works diligently,<br />
							manages the domestic help;<br />
							she treats her husband in agreeable ways<br />
							and safeguards the wealth he earns.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The woman who fulfills her duties thus,<br />
							following her husband's will and wishes,<br />
							is reborn among the devas<br />
							called "the agreeable ones."</p>
