					<p class="f4">Just as a great rain cloud, nurturing all the crops, appears for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, so too, when a good person is born in a family, it is for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people.</p>

							beneficial to his relatives and friends,<br />
							indeed, beneficial to all,<br />
							well established in the good Dhamma,<br />
							he has removed the stain of miserliness<br />
							and fares on to an auspicious world.</p>
