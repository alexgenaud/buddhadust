					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt180" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg180"><span class="f2">[180]</span></a> On that occasion Sīha the general, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was sitting in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">It then occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Doubtlessly, he must be a Blessed One, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a number of these well-known Licchavis have assembled in the meeting hall and are sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me go see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha went to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, I wish to go see the ascetic Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Since you are a proponent of deeds, Sīha, why go see the ascetic Gotama, a proponent of non-doing?</p>

					<p class="f4">For the ascetic Gotama is a proponent of of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha's determination to go see the Blessed One subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a second occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha ...</p>

					<p class="f4">[All as above, except this is now said to occur "on a second occasion."]</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt181" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg181"><span class="f2">[181]</span></a> ... On a second occasion, Sīha's determination to go see the Blessed One subsided.</p>

					<p class="f4">On a third occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">It then occurred to Sīha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Doubtlessly, he must be a Blessed One, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a number of these well-known Licchavis have assembled in the meeting hall and are sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">What can the Nigaṇṭhas do to me whether or not I obtain their permission?</p>

					<p class="f4">Without having obtained the permission of the Nigaṇṭhas, let me go see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with five hundred chariots, Sīha the general set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day in order to see the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then dismounted from his carriage and entered the monastery grounds on foot.</p>

					<p class="f4">He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard this, bhante:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing <a id="pt182" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg182"><span class="f2">[182]</span></a> who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Do those who speak thus state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they would not incur any reasonable criticism or ground for censure?</p>

					<p class="f4">For we do not want to misrepresent the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "There is, Sīha, a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of deeds who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of deeds and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(5) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of abolition and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of torment and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is retiring, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of retiring and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "There is a way in which one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a consoler who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And in what way, Sīha, could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing <a id="pt183" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg183"><span class="f2">[183]</span></a> who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I assert the non-doing of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I assert the non-doing of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And in what way could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of deeds who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of deeds and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I assert good bodily, verbal, and mental conduct; I assert the doing of the numerous kinds of wholesome deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And in what way could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I assert the annihilation of lust, hatred, and delusion; I assert the annihilation of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) "And in what way could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I am repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I am repelled by the acquisition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of abolition and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of lust, hatred, and delusion; <a id="pt184" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg184"><span class="f2">[184]</span></a> I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist; he teaches his Dhamma for the sake of abolition and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) "And in what way could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of tormenting and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I assert that bad unwholesome qualities — bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct — are to be burned up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say that someone is a tormentor when he has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; when he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of tormenting and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(7) "And in what way could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is retiring, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of retiring and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I say that someone is retiring when he has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; when he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is retiring, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of retiring and thereby guides his disciples.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) "And in what way could one rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a consoler, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guides his disciples'?</p>

					<p class="f4">For I <a id="pt185" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg185"><span class="f2">[185]</span></a> am a consoler with the supreme consolation; I teach the Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guide my disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that one could rightly say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama is a consoler, one who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of consolation and thereby guides his disciples.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, bhante!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, bhante!</p>

					<p class="f4">... Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Make an investigation, Sīha!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Make an investigation, Sīha!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For if the members of other sects were to gain me as their disciple, they would carry a banner all over Vesālī announcing:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sīha the general has become our disciple.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Blessed One rather tells me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So for the second time, bhante, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saŋgha of bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sīha, your family has long been a fountain of support for the Nigaṇṭhas; hence you should consider continuing to give alms to them when they approach you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sīha, your family has long been a fountain of support for the Nigaṇṭhas; hence you should consider continuing to give alms to them when they approach you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For I have heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama says thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt186" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg186"><span class="f2">[186]</span></a> "Alms should be given only to me, not to others; alms should be given only to my disciples, not to the disciples of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others; only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet the Blessed One encourages me to give to the Nigaṇṭhas, too.</p>

					<p class="f4">We'll know the right time for this.</p>

					<p class="f4">So for the third time, bhante, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saŋgha of bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One gave Sīha the general a progressive discourse, that is, talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Blessed One knew that Sīha's mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sīha the general became one who had seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and become independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, please let the Blessed One <a id="pt187" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg187"><span class="f2">[187]</span></a> together with the  Saŋgha of bhikkhus accept tomorrow's meal from me."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having understood that the Blessed One had consented, Sīha rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha addressed a man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, good man, find some meat ready for sale."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night had passed, Sīha the general had various kinds of excellent foods prepared in his own residence, after which he had the time announced to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, bhante, the meal is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, went to Sīha's residence along with the Saŋgha of bhikkhus, and sat down on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a number of Nigaṇṭhas [went] from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today Sīha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">The ascetic Gotama knowingly uses meat [obtained from an animal killed] especially for his sake, the act being done on his account."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man approached Sīha the general and whispered into his ear:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, you should know that a number of Nigaṇṭhas [are going] from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Today Sīha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">The ascetic Gotama knowingly uses meat [obtained from an animal killed] especially for his sake, <a id="pt188" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.012.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[188]</span></a> a deed done on his account.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, good man.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time those venerable ones have wanted to discredit the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">They will never stop misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is untrue, baseless, false, and contrary to fact; and we would never intentionally deprive a living being of life, even for the sake of our life."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with his own hands, Sīha the general served and satisfied the Saŋgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of excellent food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Sīha sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Sīha with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
