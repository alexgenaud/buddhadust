					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) There is a person who is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) a person who is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what kind of person, bhikkhus, is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even though one does not follow the example of such a person, a bad report still circulates about oneself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He has bad friends, bad companions, bad comrades.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a snake that has passed through feces, though it does not bite one, would smear one, so too, though one does not follow the example of such a person, a bad report still circulates about oneself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He has bad friends, bad companions, bad comrades.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore such a person is to be looked upon with disgust, not to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what kind of person is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is prone to anger and easily exasperated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if he is criticized slightly he loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a festering sore, if struck by a stick or a shard, will discharge even more matter, so too...</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a firebrand of the/ tinduka/ tree, if struck by a stick or shard, will sizzle and crackle even more, so too...</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a pit of feces, if struck by a stick or a shard, becomes even more foul-smelling, so too some person here is prone to anger and... displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">[With the thought:]</p>

					<p class="f4">'He might insult me, revile me, and do me harm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore such a person is to be looked upon with equanimity, not to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is virtuous and of good character.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even though one does not follow the example of such a person, a good report still circulates about oneself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He has good friends, good companions, good comrades.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">One who associates with an inferior person declines;<br />
							one who associates with an equal does not decline;<br />
							attending on a superior person one develops quickly;<br />
							therefore you should follow one superior to yourself.</p>
