					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) The first is the place where he was born.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) The second is the place where he was head-anointed a khattiya king.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) And the third is the place where, having triumphed in battle, he emerged victorious and settled at the head of the battlefield.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three [places] that a head-anointed khattiya king should remember all his life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, there are these three [places] that a bhikkhu should remember all his life.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) The first is the place where he shaved off his hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) The second is the place where he understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of suffering,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of suffering,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) And the third is the place where, with the destruction of the taints, he realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, dwelled in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three [places] that a bhikkhu should remember all his life."</p>
