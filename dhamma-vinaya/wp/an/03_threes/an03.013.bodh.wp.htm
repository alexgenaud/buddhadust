					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one without expectation, the one full of expectation, and the one who has overcome expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person without expectation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a person has been reborn in a low family — a family of <i>caṇḍālas,</i> bamboo workers, hunters, cart makers, or flower scavengers — one that is poor, with little food and drink, that subsists with difficulty, where food and clothing are obtained with difficulty; and he is ugly, unsightly, dwarfish, with much illness: blind, crippled, lame, or paralyzed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not obtain food, drink, clothing, and vehicles; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, housing, and lighting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The khattiyas have anointed such and such a khattiya.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When will the khattiyas anoint me too?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person without expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what is the person full of expectation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, the eldest son of a head-anointed khattiya king, one due to be anointed but not yet anointed, has attained the unshaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The khattiyas have anointed such and such a khattiya.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When will the khattiyas anoint me too?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person full of expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what is the person who has overcome expectation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a head-anointed khattiya king hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a khattiya has been anointed by the khattiyas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When will the khattiyas anoint me too?'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because his past expectation of anointment subsided when he was anointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person who has overcome expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, there are three kinds of persons found existing among the bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one without expectation, the one full of expectation, and the one who has overcome expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person without expectation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is immoral, of bad character, of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, dwell in it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person without expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what is the person full of expectation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous, of good character.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, dwell in it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person full of expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what is the person who has overcome expectation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such bhikkhu, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When will I, too, with the destruction of the taints, realize for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom; and having entered upon it, dwell in it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because his past expectation of liberation subsided when he was liberated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person who has overcome expectation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing among the bhikkhus."</p>
