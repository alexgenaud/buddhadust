<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Threes, Sutta 32. Ānanda asks the Buddha whether or not there is a state of samadhi in which there is no I-making or My-Making and yet there is liberation of the heart by wisdom. The Buddha replies that this state is attained thinking: 'This is sanity, this is the pinnacle, that is, the calming of all own-making, the forsaking of upkeep, the destruction of thirst, dispassion, ending, Nibbana." />

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) he would enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He could, Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Ānanda, a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; he would have no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and he would enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Puṇṇaka:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Having comprehended the highs and lows in the world,<br />
							he is not perturbed by anything in the world.<br />
							Peaceful, fumeless, untroubled, wishless,<br />
							he has, I say, crossed over birth and old age."</p>
