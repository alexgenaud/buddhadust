					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Here, bhikkhus, some person generates afflictive bodily activities, afflictive verbal activities, and afflictive mental activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence, he is reborn in an afflictive world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is reborn in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts touch him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being touched by afflictive contacts, he feels afflictive feelings, exclusively painful, as in the case of hell-beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Someone else generates an unafflictive bodily activities, unafflictive verbal activities, and unafflictive mental activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence, he is reborn in an unafflictive world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is reborn in an unafflictive world, unafflictive contacts touch him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being touched by unafflictive contacts, he feels unafflictive feelings, exclusively pleasant, as in the case of the devas of refulgent glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Still another generates bodily activities that are both afflictive and unafflictive, verbal activities that are both afflictive and unafflictive, and mental activities that are both afflictive and unafflictive.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence, he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is reborn in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive, both afflictive and unafflictive contacts touch him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being touched by both afflictive and unafflictive contacts, he feels both afflictive and unafflictive feelings, mingled pleasure and pain, as in the case of human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."</p>
