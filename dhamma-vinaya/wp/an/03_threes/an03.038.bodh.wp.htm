(Wisdom Publications #38). The Buddha shows how Sakka's pointing to himself as an example of a fitting reward for observing uposatha and behavior in accordance with the precepts is not suitable." />

					<p class="f4">"This verse, bhikkhus, was badly recited by Sakka, ruler of the devas, not well recited. It was badly stated, not well stated.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because Sakka, ruler of the devas, is not free from birth, old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; he is not free from suffering, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in the case of a bhikkhu who is an arahant — one whose taints are destroyed ... one completely liberated through final knowledge — it is fitting for him to say:</p>
