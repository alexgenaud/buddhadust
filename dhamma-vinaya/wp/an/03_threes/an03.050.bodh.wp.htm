					<p class="f4">Here, a master thief depends on the uneven, on thickets, and on powerful people.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And how does a master thief depend on the uneven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a master thief depends on rivers that are hard to cross and rugged mountains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a master thief depends on the uneven.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how does a master thief depend on thickets?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a master thief depends on a a thicket of cane, a thicket of trees, a coppice, or a large dense jungle.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is by possessing these three factors that a master thief breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits banditry, and ambushes highways.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, an evil bhikkhu maintains himself in a maimed and injured condition, is blameworthy and subject to reproach by the wise, and generates much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, an evil bhikkhu depends on the uneven, on thickets, and on powerful people.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on the uneven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, an evil bhikkhu engages in unrighteous bodily, verbal, and mental action.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how does an evil bhikkhu depend on thickets?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, an evil bhikkhu holds wrong view, adopts an extremist view.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that an evil bhikkhu depends on thickets.</p>
