					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a shopkeeper has keen eyes, is responsible, and has benefactors.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a shopkeeper have keen eyes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a shopkeeper knows of an item:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If this item is bought at such a price and sold at such a price, it will require this much capital and bring this much profit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a shopkeeper has keen eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how is a shopkeeper responsible?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a shopkeeper is skilled in buying and selling goods.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a shopkeeper is responsible.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And how does a shopkeeper have benefactors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, rich, wealthy, affluent householders and householders' sons know him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This good shopkeeper has keen eyes and is responsible; he is able to support his wife and children and pay us back from time to time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they deposit wealth with him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having earned wealth with this, friend shopkeeper, support your wife and children and pay us back from time to time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a shopkeeper has benefactors.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessing these three factors, a shopkeeper soon attains vast and abundant wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, bhikkhus, possessing three qualities, a bhikkhu soon attains vast and abundant wholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has keen eyes, is responsible, and has benefactors.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu have keen eyes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu understands as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is suffering' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has keen eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And how is a bhikkhu responsible?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu is responsible.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And how does a bhikkhu have benefactors?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, from time to time a bhikkhu approaches those bhikkhus who are learned, heirs to the heritage, experts on the Dhamma, experts on the discipline, experts on the outlines, and inquires:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is this, bhante?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the meaning of this?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those venerable ones then disclose to him what has not been disclosed, clear up what is obscure, and dispel his perplexity about numerous perplexing points.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that a bhikkhu has benefactors.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessing these three qualities, a bhikkhu soon attains great and vast achievements in wholesome qualities."</p>
