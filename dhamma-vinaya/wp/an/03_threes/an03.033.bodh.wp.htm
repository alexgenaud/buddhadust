					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is those who can understand that are rare."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the time for this, Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the time for this, Fortunate One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One should teach the Dhamma briefly; he should teach the Dhamma in detail; he should teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be those who can understand the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Sāriputta you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) 'There will be no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) there will be no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) we will enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, Sāriputta that you should train yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, Sāriputta a bhikkhu has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; when he has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and when he enters and dwells in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in 'The Questions of Udaya':</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The abandoning of both<br />
							sensual perceptions and dejection;<br />
							the dispelling of dullness,<br />
							the warding off of remorse;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">with equanimity and mindfulness purified,<br />
							preceded by reflection on the Dhamma:<br />
							this, I say, is emancipation by final knowledge,<br />
							the breaking up of ignorance."</p>
