					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, I have heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Alms should be given only to me, <a id="pt161" href="../../../pali/an/03_threes/an03.057.pali.bd.htm#pg161"><span class="f2">[161]</span></a> not to others; alms should be given only to my disciples, not to the disciples of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others; only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Do those who speak thus state what has been said by Master Gotama and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they would not incur <a id="pg255"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span></a> any reasonable criticism or ground for censure?</p>

					<p class="f4">For we do not want to misrepresent Master Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those, Vaccha, who say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ascetic Gotama says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Alms should be given only to me ... only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others,"'</p>

					<p class="f4">do not state what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who prevents another from giving alms creates an obstruction and stumbling block for three people.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He creates an obstruction to the donor's acquiring merit, to the recipients' gaining a gift, and already he has maimed and injured himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who prevents another from giving alms creates an obstruction and stumbling block for these three people.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Vaccha, I say that one acquires merit even if one throws away dishwashing water in a refuse dump or cesspit with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the living beings here sustain themselves with this!'</p>

					<p class="f4">How much more, then, [does one acquire merit] when one gives to human beings!</p>

					<p class="f4">However, I say that what is given to one of virtuous behavior is more fruitful than [what is given] to an immoral person.</p>

					<p class="f4">And [the most worthy recipient] is one who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What five factors has he abandoned?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual desire, ill will, dullness <a id="pt162" href="../../../pali/an/03_threes/an03.057.pali.bd.htm#pg162"><span class="f2">[162]</span></a> and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five factors that he has abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what five factors does he possess?</p>

					<p class="f4">The virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge and vision of liberation of one beyond training.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five factors that he possesses.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in such a way, I say, that what is given to one who has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Among cattle of any sort,<br />
							whether black, white, red, or golden,<br />
							mottled, uniform, or pigeon-colored,<br />
							the tamed bull is born,<br />
							the one that can bear the load,<br />
							possessing strength, advancing with good speed.<br />
							They yoke the burden just to him;<br />
							they are not concerned about his color.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"> <a id="pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> So too, among human beings<br />
							it is in any kind of birth —<br />
							among khattiyas, brahmins, vessas,<br />
							suddas, /caṇḍālas/, or scavengers —<br />
							among people of any sort<br />
							that the tamed person of good manners is born:<br />
							one firm in Dhamma, virtuous in conduct,<br />
							truthful in speech, endowed with moral shame;<br />
							one who has abandoned birth and death,<br />
							consummate in the spiritual life,<br />
							with the burden dropped, detached,<br />
							who has done his task, free of taints;<br />
							who has gone beyond all things [of the world]<br />
							and by non-clinging has reached Nibbānā:<br />
							an offering is truly vast<br />
							when planted in that spotless field.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Fools devoid of understanding,<br />
							dull-witted, unlearned,<br />
							do not attend on the holy ones<br />
							but give their gifts to those outside.<br />
							Those, however, who attend on the holy ones,<br />
							on the wise ones esteemed as sagely,<br />
							and those whose faith in the Fortunate One<br />
							is deeply rooted and well established,<br />
							go to the world of the devas<br />
							or are born here in a good family.<br />
							Advancing in successive steps,<br />
							those wise ones attain Nibbānā.</p>
