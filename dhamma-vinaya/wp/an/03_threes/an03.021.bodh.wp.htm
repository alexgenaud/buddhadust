					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Saviṭṭha and the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Sāriputta then said to the Venerable Saviṭṭha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Saviṭṭha, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The body witness, the one attained to view, and the one liberated by faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the one liberated by faith to be the most excellent and sublime.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this person's faculty of faith is predominant."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Koṭṭhita, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world....</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the body witness to be the most excellent and sublime.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this person's faculty of concentration is predominant."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world....</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of these three kinds of persons do you consider the most excellent and sublime?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Koṭṭhita, of those three kinds of persons, I consider the one attained to view to be the most excellent and sublime.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this person's faculty of wisdom is predominant."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Saviṭṭha and the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, we have each explained according to our own ideal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let's approach the Blessed One and report this matter to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will retain it in mind as he explains it to us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the Venerable Saviṭṭha and the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Venerable Sāriputta, the Venerable Saviṭṭha, and the Venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Venerable Sāriputta then reported to him the entire conversation that had taken place.</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Blessed One said:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "For it is possible that a person liberated by faith is practicing for arahantship, while a body witness and one attained to view are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "It is possible that a person who is a body witness is practicing for arahantship, while one liberated by faith and one attained to view are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "It is possible that a person attained to view is practicing for arahantship, while one liberated by faith and a body witness are once-returners or non-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">It isn't easy, Sāriputta, to make a definitive declaration about this matter and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of these three kinds of persons, this one is the most excellent and sublime."</p>
