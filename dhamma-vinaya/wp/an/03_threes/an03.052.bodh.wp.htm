					<p class="f4">"We are brahmins, Master Gotama, old, aged ... a hundred and twenty years of age.</p>

					<p class="f4">But we have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have we made a shelter for ourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let Master Gotama exhort us and instruct us in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness for a long time!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, brahmins, you are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, a hundred and twenty years of age, but you have not done anything good and wholesome, nor have you made a shelter for yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, this world is burning with old age, illness, and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">But though the world is burning with old age, illness, and death, when one has departed, bodily, verbal, and mental self-control will provide a shelter, a harbor, an island, a refuge, and a support."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When one's house is ablaze<br />
							the vessel taken out<br />
							is the one that will be useful to you,<br />
							not the one that is burnt inside.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">So since the world is ablaze<br />
							with old age and death,<br />
							one should take out by giving:<br />
							what is given is well taken out.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When one departs [this life],<br />
							self-control over body, speech, and mind,<br />
							and the deeds of merit one did while alive,<br />
							lead to one's happiness.</p>
