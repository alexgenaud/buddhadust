					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, whatever perils arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever calamities arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever misfortunes arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a fire that starts in a house made of reeds or grass burns down even a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed; so too, whatever perils arise ... all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) Thus, bhikkhus, the fool brings peril, the wise person brings no peril;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) the fool brings calamity, the wise person brings no calamity;</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) the fool brings misfortune, the wise person brings no misfortune.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no peril from the wise person; there is no calamity from the wise person; there is no misfortune from the wise person.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and practice those three qualities possessing which one is known as a wise person.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way that you should train yourselves."</p>
