					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) There is a person who is not to be associated with, followed, and served;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) a person who is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what kind of person, bhikkhus, is not to be associated with, followed, and served?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is inferior [to oneself] in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is not to be associated with, followed, and served except out of sympathy and compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is similar [to oneself] in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom. Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">[Because one considers:]</p>

					<p class="f4">'Since we are similar with regard to virtuous behavior, we will have a discussion on virtuous behavior, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since we are similar with regard to concentration, we will have a discussion on concentration, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since we are similar with regard to wisdom, we will have a discussion on wisdom, and it will flow on smoothly between us, and we will feel at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person is superior [to oneself] in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">[Because one considers:]</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such a way I will fulfill the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of virtuous behavior that I have fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will fulfill the aggregate of concentration that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of concentration that I have fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will fulfill the aggregate of wisdom that I have not yet fulfilled or assist with wisdom in various respects the aggregate of wisdom that I have fulfilled.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore such a person is to be associated with, followed, and served with honor and respect.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">One who associates with an inferior person declines;<br />
							one who associates with an equal does not decline;<br />
							attending on a superior person one develops quickly;<br />
							therefore you should follow one superior to yourself.</p>
