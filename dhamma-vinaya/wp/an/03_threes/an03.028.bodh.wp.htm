<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Threes, Sutta 28. The Buddha characterizes three sorts of speech: The one who gives false testimony is like dung; the one who gives true testimony is like flowers; the one who having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech, speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many is like honey." />

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is the person whose speech is like dung?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, if he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So, good man, tell what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then, not knowing, this person says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or knowing, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know';</p>

					<p class="f4">not seeing, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I see,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or seeing, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he consciously speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person whose speech is like dung.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what is the person whose speech is like flowers?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, if he is summoned to a council, to an assembly, to his relatives' presence, to his guild, or to the court, and questioned as a witness thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So, good man, tell what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then, not knowing, this person says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he does not consciously speak falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the person whose speech is like flowers.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what is the person whose speech is like honey?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, some person, having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the person whose speech is like honey.</p>
