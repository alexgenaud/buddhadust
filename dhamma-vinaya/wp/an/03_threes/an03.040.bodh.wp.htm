<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Threes, Sutta 40. The bhikkhu who has given up the household life to seek an end to pain who then indulges a variety of low thoughts is encouraged to put his better self in charge or to make himself aware that there are those in the world who can read his thoughts and by that put the world in charge, or to remind himself that the Dhamma, was well taught by Gotama for just this purpose and to put the Dhamma in charge, and by one or another of these means overcome his misguided ways." />

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Oneself as
					one's authority; the world as one's authority; and the Dhamma as one's
					authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "And what, bhikkhus, is oneself as one's authority?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, having
					gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a bhikkhu
					reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not go forth from the household life into
					homelessness for the sake of a robe, almsfood, or lodging, or for the
					sake of becoming this or that, but rather [with the thought]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am
					immersed in birth, old age, and death; in sorrow, lamentation, pain,
					dejection, and anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by
					suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be
					discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">s one who has gone forth from the household life into
					homelessness, it would not be proper for me to seek out sensual
					pleasures similar to or worse than those that I have discarded.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He then
					reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Energy will be aroused in me without slackening;
					mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be
					tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and
					one-pointed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken himself as his authority, he abandons the
					unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy
					and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is
					called oneself as one's authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "And what, bhikkhus, is the world as one's authority?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here,
					having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a
					bhikkhu reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not go forth from the household life into
					homelessness for the sake of a robe ... but rather [with the thought]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I
					am immersed in birth, old age, and death ... Perhaps an ending of this
					entire mass of suffering can be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">As one who has gone forth
					from the household life into homelessness, I might think sensual
					thoughts, thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of harming.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the abode of
					the world is vast.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the vast abode of the world there are ascetics and
					brahmins with psychic potency and the divine eye who know the minds of
					others.</p>

					<p class="f4">They see things from a distance but they are not themselves seen
					even when they're close; they know the minds [of others] with their own
					mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">They would know me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Look at this clansman: though he has
					gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, he is
					tarnished by bad unwholesome states."</p>

					<p class="f4">There are deities, too, with
					psychic potency and the divine eye who know the minds of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">They
					see even from a distance but are not seen themselves even when close;
					they too know the minds [of others] with their own mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">They too would
					know me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Look at this clansman: though he has gone forth from the
					household life into homelessness out of faith, he is tarnished by bad
					unwholesome states."'</p>

					<p class="f4">He then reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Energy will be aroused in
					me without slackening; mindfulness will be established without
					confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be
					concentrated and one-pointed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken the world as his authority,
					he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what
					is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in
					purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the world as one's authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma as one's authority?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here,
					having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a
					bhikkhu reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not go forth from the household life into
					homelessness for the sake of a robe ... but rather [with the thought]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I
					am immersed in birth, old age, and death ... Perhaps an ending of this
					entire mass of suffering can be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Dhamma is well expounded
					by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come
					and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are
					fellow monks of mine who know and see.</p>

					<p class="f4">As one who has gone forth from
					the household life into homelessness in this well-expounded Dhamma and
					discipline, it would be improper for me to be lazy and heedless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He
					then reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Energy will be aroused in me without slackening;
					mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be
					tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and
					one-pointed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken the Dhamma as his authority, he abandons the
					unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy
					and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is
					called the Dhamma as one's authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the three authorities."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">For one performing an evil deed<br />
							there is no place in the world called "hidden."<br />
							The self within you knows, O person,<br />
							whether it is true or false.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Indeed, sir, you the witness<br />
							despise your good self;<br />
							you conceal the evil self<br />
							existing within yourself.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The devas and <br />Tathāgatas see the fool<br />
							acting unrighteously in the world.<br />
							Therefore one should fare mindfully,<br />
							taking oneself as authority;<br />
							alert and meditative, taking the world as authority;<br />
							and fare in accordance with the Dhamma,<br />
							taking the Dhamma as authority.<br />
							Truly exerting himself, a sage does not decline.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Having vanquished Māra<br />
							and overcome the end-maker,<br />
							the striver has finished with birth.<br />
							Such a sage, wise, a world-knower,<br />
							identifies with nothing at all."</p>
