					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) they grow in bark and shoots; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) they grow in softwood and heartwood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these three ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So too, when the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in three ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) They grow in faith;</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) they grow in virtuous behavior; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) they grow in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the head of a family has faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these three ways."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Just as the trees that grow<br />
							in dependence on a rocky mountain<br />
							in a vast forest wilderness<br />
							might become great 'woodland lords,'<br />
							so, when the head of a family here<br />
							possesses faith and virtue,<br />
							his wife, children, and relatives<br />
							all grow in dependence upon him;<br />
							so too his friends, his family circle,<br />
							and those dependent on him.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Those possessed of discernment,<br />
							seeing that virtuous man's good conduct,<br />
							his generosity and good deeds,<br />
							emulate his example.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Having lived here in accord with Dhamma,<br />
							the path leading to a good destination,<br />
							those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice,<br />
							delighting in the deva world."</p>
