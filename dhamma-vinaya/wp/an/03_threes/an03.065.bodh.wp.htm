					<p class="f4">The Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened ... [as at <a href="an03.063.bodh.wp.htm">3:63</a>] ... [and] reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is good to see such arahants."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Kālāmas of Kesaputta approached the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one <a id="pg280"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span></a> side ... [as at <a href="an03.063.bodh.wp.htm">3:63</a>] ... some kept silent and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sitting to one side, the Kālāmas said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">They explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesaputta, <a id="pt189" href="../../../pali/an/03_threes/an03.065.pali.bd.htm#pg189"><span class="f2">[189]</span></a> and they too explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">We are perplexed and in doubt, bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Kālāmas, it is fitting for you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Kālāmas, you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then you should abandon them.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For his harm, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kālāmas, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another's wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When hatred arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For his harm, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kālāmas, a person who is full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life ... and he encourages others to do likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a> (3) "What do you think, Kālāmas? When delusion arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Unwholesome, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blameworthy or blameless?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blameworthy, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Censured or praised by the wise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Censured by the wise, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, or how do you take it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to harm and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">So we take it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Kālāmas, when we said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition ... But when you know for yourselves: "These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering," then you should abandon them,'</p>

					<p class="f4">it is because of this that this was said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: 'The ascetic is our guru.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness,' then you should live in accordance with them.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When non-greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For his welfare, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kālāmas, a person without greed, not overcome by greed, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life, take what is not given, transgress with another's wife, or speak falsehood; nor does he encourage others to do likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wholesome, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blameworthy or blameless?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Blameless, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Censured or praised by the wise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Praised by the wise, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to welfare and happiness or not, or how do you take it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So we take it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Kālāmas, when we said:</p>

					<p class="f4">it is because of this that this was said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Kālāmas, that noble disciple, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness ... with a mind imbued with compassion ... with a mind imbued with altruistic joy ... with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> "This noble disciple, Kālāmas, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won four assurances in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The first assurance he has won is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If there is another world, and if there is the fruit and result of good and bad deeds, it is possible that with the breakup of the body, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"The second assurance he has won is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If there is no other world, and there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds, still right here, in this very life, I maintain myself in happiness, without enmity and ill will, free of trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The third assurance he has won is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose evil comes to one who does evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when I have no evil intentions towards anyone, how can suffering afflict me, since I do no evil deed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"The fourth assurance he has won is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose evil does not come to one who does evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then right here I see myself purified in both respects.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This noble disciple, Kālāmas, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won these four assurances in this very life."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Fortunate One!</p>

					<p class="f4">This noble disciple whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, <a id="pt193" href="../../../pali/an/03_threes/an03.065.pali.bd.htm#pg193"><span class="f2">[193]</span></a> has won four assurances in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, bhante!...</p>

					<p class="f4">We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saŋghaof bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One consider us lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life."</p>
