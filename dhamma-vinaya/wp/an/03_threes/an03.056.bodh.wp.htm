<meta name="description" content="Selections from the Bhikkhus Bodhi translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, The Book of the Threes, Sutta 56. A wealthy brahmin has heard the story told by the ancients of a time when this world was densely populated and villages and towns and cities grew up right next to each other. He asks Gotama why it is that this is no longer the case and is told that it is because at this time the people are obsessed with lusts, depravities and wrong views resulting in a number of calamaties that depopulate the earth." />

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, I have heard older brahmins who are aged, burdened with years, teachers of teachers, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the past this world was so thickly populated one would think there was no space between people.</p>

					<p class="f4">The villages, towns, and capital cities were so close that cocks could fly between them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is it, Master Gotama, that at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, <a id="pt160" href="../../../pali/an/03_threes/an03.056.pali.bd.htm#pg160"><span class="f2">[160]</span></a> towns, cities, and districts have been forsaken?"</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "At present, brahmin, people are excited by illicit lust, overcome by unrighteous greed, afflicted by wrong Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result, they take up weapons and slay one another.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence many people die.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a reason why at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, towns, cities, and districts have been forsaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Again, at present people are excited by illicit lust, overcome by unrighteous greed, afflicted by wrong Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens, sufficient rain does not fall.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result, there is a famine, a scarcity of grain; the crops become blighted and turn to straw.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence many people die.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is another reason why at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, towns, cities, and districts have been forsaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Again, at present people are excited by illicit lust, overcome by unrighteous greed, afflicted by wrong Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens, the <i>yakkhas</i> release wild spirits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence many people die.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is yet another reason why at present the number of people has declined, depopulation is seen, and villages, towns, cities, and districts have been forsaken."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">... Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>
