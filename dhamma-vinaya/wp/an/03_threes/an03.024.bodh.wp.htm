					<p class="f4">This person is helpful to the other person.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These three persons are helpful to another person.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say, bhikkhus, that there is no one more helpful to another person than these three persons.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say, too, that it is not easy to repay these three persons by paying homage to them, by rising up for them, by reverential salutation, by proper conduct, and by presenting them with robes, almsfood, lodging, and medicines and provisions for the sick."</p>
