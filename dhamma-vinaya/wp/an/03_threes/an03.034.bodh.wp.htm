					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Any kamma, bhikkhus, fashioned through greed, born of greed, caused by greed, originated by greed, ripens wherever the individual is reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Any kamma fashioned through hatred, born of hatred, caused by hatred, originated by hatred, ripens wherever the individual is reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Any kamma fashioned through delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originated by delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun's heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited in well-prepared ground in a good field and receive proper rainfall: in this way, those seeds would grow, increase, and mature.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, any kamma that is fashioned through greed ... hatred ... delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originated by delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the three causes for the origination of kamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, there are these three [other] causes for the origination of kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Non-greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Any kamma, bhikkhus, fashioned through non-greed, born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, originated by non-greed, is abandoned when greed has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2) "Any kamma fashioned through non-hatred, born of non-hatred, caused by non-hatred, originated by non-hatred, is abandoned when hatred has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) "Any kamma fashioned through non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originated by non-delusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, bhikkhus, there are seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun's heat, fecund, well preserved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man would burn them in a fire, reduce them to ashes, and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, those seeds would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, any kamma that is fashioned through non-greed ... non-hatred ... non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originated by non-delusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, bhikkhus, are the three causes for the origination of kamma."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whatever kamma a wise person [had done]<br />
							born of greed, hatred, and delusion,<br />
							whether what was fashioned by him be little or much,<br />
							it is to be experienced right here:<br />
							there exists no other site [for it].</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Therefore a wise person should abandon<br />
							[any deed] born of greed, hatred, and delusion.<br />
							A bhikkhu, giving rise to knowledge,<br />
							should abandon all bad destinations.</p>
