					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1114" href="#fn1114">1114</a>]</sup> RD has 'like a load of soaked beans', following DA, but the sense of 'pregnant' seems well established. Perhaps a case of prudishness on Buddhaghosa's part, echoed by Mrs Rhys Davids.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1115" href="#fn1115">1115</a>]</sup> In practising (not 'studying': RD) for calm and insight. Giving (RD has 'forgiving' - a misprint for 'for giving'!) softens the heart in both donor and recipient. DA quotes the verse also found at VM 9.39:</p>

					<p class="in4">A gift for taming the untamed,<br />
					A gift for every kind of good;<br />
					Through giving gifts they do unbend<br />
					And condescend to kindly speech.</p>

					<p class="in6 f2">— (Ñāṇamoli's translation).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1116" href="#fn1116">1116</a>]</sup> 'Expands' (RD). But this is the usual verb for'developing' in meditation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1117" href="#fn1117">1117</a>]</sup> 'I.e. its being unmixed, single-minded' (RD). DA has no comment, but the idea of the power of such a 'pureminded' aspiration is very similar to that regarding the efficacy of a 'declaration of truth'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1118" href="#fn1118">1118</a>]</sup> Brahmā to the Buddha is not immortal and is not a creator-god: His wisdom, though considerable, is limited, and he can be boastful (see DN 11!), but he is free from sensual passions, and so must those be who are reborn in his realm (though the passions may have only been suppressed by <i>jhāna</i> - which is <i>cetovimutti</i> 'liberation of the heart' - and not necessarily by insight, which is <i>paññāvimutti</i> 'liberation by wisdom': cf. nn.355, 868). But those who are reborn there have not, says the Sub-Commentary, got rid of the desire for continued existence (<i>bhavataṇhā:</i> n.1032).</p>
