<meta name="description" content="The M. Walshe translation of DN 22: Dīgha Nikāya, Sutta 22: Mahā Sati-Paṭṭhāna Suttantaɱ: The Setting Up of Mindfulness. The long version of the famous sutta in which the Buddha describes the setting up of the mind by way of understanding the origin, sustainance and ending of body, sense experience, mental states and the Dhamma. Possibly the most famous, certainly one of the most important of all the Buddhas Suttas. It is this sutta which is the basis for the wide-spread 'mindfulness' business which makes use of but the first of its instructions." />

Here, a monk, detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself the joy of which the Noble Ones say: "Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness", he enters the third jhāna. And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, which is beyond pleasure amd pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness. This is called Right Concentration. And that, monks, is called the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(INSIGHT)</p>

					<p class="f4">'So he abides conternplating mind-objects as mind-objects internally, <b>[<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.22.pali.bd.htm#p314">314</a>]</b> contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects externally, contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects both internally and externally. He abides contemplating arising phenomena in mind-objects, he abides contemplating vanishing-phenomena in mind-objects, he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in mind-objects. Or else, mindfulness that "there are mind-objects" is present just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness. And he abides detached, not grasping at anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in respect of the Four Noble Truths.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n624" href="#fn624">624</a>]</sup> This is generally regarded as the most important Sutta in the entire Pali Canon. It recurs verbatim at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">MN 10</a> as the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, with the omission of verses 18-21. The text (or that of MN 10) has been separately translated a number of times, notably by Soma Thera as <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.010.soma.ati.htm">The Way of Mindfulness</a> (2nd ed. Colombo 1949, 3rd ed. BPS 1967). The important book The Heart of Buddhist Meditation by Nyāṇaponika Mahāthera (Colombo 1954, London 1973 and later) is essentially based on this Sutta and contains a translation, not only of this but of other relevant texts from the Pali Canon and from Mahayana sources (especially Sāntideva's Siksāsamuccaya). The author's remark in the Introduction (p. 14) should also be noted: 'Among the Mahayana schools of the Far East, it is chiefly the Chinese Ch'an and Japanese Zen that are closest to the spirit of Satipaṭṭhāna. Notwithstanding the differences in method, aim and basic philosophical conceptions, the connecting links with Satipaṭṭhāna are close and strong, and it is regrettable that they have hardly been stressed or noticed.' It should however be mentioned that since those words were written, the realisation has begun to dawn that Zen has much in common with Theravada in general, and the Satipaṭṭhāna method in particular — somewhat to the surprise of some who have overstressed the 'uniqueness' of Zen. The cross-headings in this Sutta correspond closely to those used by the Ven. Ñāṇamoli for MN 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n625" href="#fn625">625</a>]</sup> Or Kammāsadhamma. For explanation of the construction, see DN 15, n.319.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n626" href="#fn626">626</a>]</sup> Ekāyano maggo. Sometimes translated 'the only way' or 'the one and only way' with, on occasion, a slightly triumphalist connotation. DA in fact offers a number of possibilities, thus showing that the old commentators were not entirely sure of the exact meaning. Ekāyana can be literally rendered 'one-going', which is ambiguous. Ñāṇamoli has 'a path that goes one way only'. In any case it should not be confused with the term sometimes found in Buddhist Sanskrit ekayāna 'one vehicle' or 'career'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n627" href="#fn627">627</a>]</sup> Domanassa: in this context usually translated 'grief', but cf. DN 21, n.609.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n628" href="#fn628">628</a>]</sup> Ñāya: 'leading, guiding' (sometimes = 'logic'). Here = 'the right path'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n629" href="#fn629">629</a>]</sup> Satipaṭṭhānā. It is probably a compound of sati + upaṭṭhāna (lit. 'placing near'), as in the old Sanskrit version , Sm<i>r</i>ty-upasthāna Sūtra). 'Foundations', though used by Nyāṇaponika and others, is really a makeshift translation. In any case, whatever the etymology, the meaning emerges clearly enough from the instructions that follow.<br />
					Sati (Skt. sm<i>r</i>ti) originally meant 'memory' (and still, rarely, does in Pali). The rendering 'mindfulness' by RD was a brilliant one which is almost universally used (though 'recollection' or 'recollectedness' is occasionally found). The use of 'self-possession' by A.K. Warder in his otherwise excellent Indian Buddhism is regrettable. It should perhaps be mentioned that Buddhist Sanskrit sm<i>r</i>ti is clearly used in a different sense from the Hindu sm<i>r</i>ti 'oral tradition'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n630" href="#fn630">630</a>]</sup> Bhikkhu: but here used, according to DA, for anyone who does this practice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n631" href="#fn631">631</a>]</sup> Kāye kāyānupassī viharati: lit. 'contemplating the body in the body', and with similar repetitive formulations for the other three 'foundations'. 'Why is the word "body" used twice in the phrase: "Contemplating the body in the body"? For determining the object and isolating it.' (DA). Ñāṇamoli paraphrases: 'This means not confusing, during meditation, body with feeling, mind, etc. The body is contemplated just as body, feelings just as feelings, etc.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n632" href="#fn632">632</a>]</sup> I have tried to get away from the usual rendering 'coveting and grief' in order to bring out the true meaning. The theme is fully developed in verse 19.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n633" href="#fn633">633</a>]</sup> Vedanā is feeling (physical or mental) in its most basic sense of 'sensation', pleasant, painful or neutral. It is regrettable that Warder (as n.629) has chosen 'emotion' for this word, which is precisely what it does not mean!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n634" href="#fn634">634</a>]</sup> Citta: 'mind' or, metaphorically, 'heart'. See verse 12. </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n635" href="#fn635">635</a>]</sup> Dhammā (plural): one of the standard meanings of this term (see BDic).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n636" href="#fn636">636</a>]</sup> Or 'an empty room'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n637" href="#fn637">637</a>]</sup> I.e. on the breath in front of him, as DA. Nyāṇaponika paraphrases 'keeping ... his mindfulness alert'. Readers of F.L. Woodward's somewhat dated Some Sayings of the Buddha should note that there is no basis for his footnote 'Concentrating between the eyebrows'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n638" href="#fn638">638</a>]</sup> This is the probable meaning of assasati, passasati, though it is just possible that the terms should be reversed. Ñāṇamoli's footnote: 'The exercise described is one in mental observation not in bodily development or breath control as in Hatha-yoga' may be a necessary reminder to some.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n639" href="#fn639">639</a>]</sup> Lit. 'He knows: "I breathe in a long breath"', etc. Pali regularly uses direct speech in such cases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n640" href="#fn640">640</a>]</sup> This is taken to mean 'the whole body of breath' (cf. n.337). '"Making known, making clear to myself the beginning, middle and end of the whole body of breathings in ...'", (DA, transl. Soma Thera).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n641" href="#fn641">641</a>]</sup> Kāya-saṅkhāra. This calming process may lead to the development of jhāna, but this is not the primary object here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n642" href="#fn642">642</a>]</sup> Internally means 'one's own body' and externally means 'someone else's body'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n643" href="#fn643">643</a>]</sup> Samudaya-dhammā. Samudaya is, perhaps significantly, the word used for the 'origin' of suffering in the Second Noble Truth. Awareness of how phenomena (body, etc.) come to be is meant. Ñāṇamoli has 'contemplating the body in its arising factors'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n644" href="#fn644">644</a>]</sup> Vaya-dhammā: cf. n.457. Ñāṇamoli has 'contemplating the body in its vanishing factors'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n645" href="#fn645">645</a>]</sup> Just holding the thought in mind without speculating, mind-wandering, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n646" href="#fn646">646</a>]</sup> Sampajāna-kārī hoti: 'Is acting in a clearly conscious way' (Horner). RD's rendering of 'self-possession' for sampajañña (adopted, even more ridiculously, for sati by Warder (n.629)) breaks down here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n647" href="#fn647">647</a>]</sup> Paccavekkhati. The same verb-stem is used in paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa 'reviewing-knowledge': see n.213.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n648" href="#fn648">648</a>]</sup> These first five are given as a standard meditation for novices.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n649" href="#fn649">649</a>]</sup> With the addition of 'brain' these 32 parts of the body are included as a meditation-subject: cf. VM 8.42ff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n650" href="#fn650">650</a>]</sup> Phaseolus mungo: sometimes sold in the West as 'mung beans' .</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n651" href="#fn651">651</a>]</sup> Cf. n.70.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n652" href="#fn652">652</a>]</sup> An unpleasant image, heightened for the modem reader when the hygienic aspect is considered! It shows that there were no 'sacred cows' in the Buddha's day.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n653" href="#fn653">653</a>]</sup> 'Cemetery', favoured by some translators, conveys a totally false impression: it is a place of rotting corpses just thrown down — splendid for this kind of meditation!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n654" href="#fn654">654</a>]</sup> Cf. n.633, also, for repetition, n.631.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n655" href="#fn655">655</a>]</sup> Sukhaɱ vedanaɱ: this can be bodily or mental.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n656" href="#fn656">656</a>]</sup> Dukkhaɱ vedanaɱ: this too can be bodily or mental.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n657" href="#fn657">657</a>]</sup> Adukkhamasukhaɱ vedanaɱ: this is mental only. In all cases one is simply aware that a feeling is present.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n658" href="#fn658">658</a>]</sup> Sāmisaɱ sukhaɱ vedanaɱ. Sāmisa = sa-āmisa: lit. 'with flesh', thus approximating to the sense of 'carnal'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n659" href="#fn659">659</a>]</sup> Nirāmisaɱ sukhaɱ vedanaɱ: 'non-carnal' or 'spiritual' (a word Buddhists tend to avoid owing to possibly misleading connotations). In MN 137 sāmisa and nirāmisa are referred to the 'household' life and to that of renunciation respectively.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n660" href="#fn660">660</a>]</sup> He infers, or knows telepathically, the feelings of others, and then contemplates his own feelings and those of others alternately.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n661" href="#fn661">661</a>]</sup> Citta: also rendered 'thought' or 'consciousness'. From what follows it is clear that various states of mind are meant. As with feelings, one is at this stage simply aware that certain states of mind are, or are not, present.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n662" href="#fn662">662</a>]</sup> Sankhittaɱ cittaɱ (from the verb sankhipati: cf. sankhittena 'in brief'): a mind that is 'contracted' or 'shrunken' by sloth-and-torpor (verse 13) and the like.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n663" href="#fn663">663</a>]</sup> Vikhittaɱ cittaɱ: a mind distracted by worry-and-flurry (verse 13).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n664" href="#fn664">664</a>]</sup> Mahaggataɱ: 'grown great' through the lower or higher jhānas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n665" href="#fn665">665</a>]</sup> 'Not grown great', not developed by the jhānas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n666" href="#fn666">666</a>]</sup> Sa-uttaraɱ: 'having (other mental states) surpassing it', is synonymous with the 'undeveloped' mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n667" href="#fn667">667</a>]</sup> An-uttaraɱ: 'having no other states surpassing it', might seem to refer to transcendental consciousness, but is referred by DA to mundane states, therefore in effect synonymous with the 'developed' mind. In view of the tautology involved in the last two cases, one might wonder whether the commentarial explanation is correct. But see n.670.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n668" href="#fn668">668</a>]</sup> Samāhitaɱ: having attained samādhi, i.e. jhānic absorption.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n669" href="#fn669">669</a>]</sup> Not having attained such absorption, thus as in nn.665-6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n670" href="#fn670">670</a>]</sup> Vimuttaɱ. This is stated by DA to mean the mind that is temporarily 'freed' either by insight or by jhāna, which suppresses the defilements. Neither is, of course, true and permanent liberation. 'There is no occasion here for the liberations by cutting-off, final stilling (paṭipassaddhi) and final escape (nissaraṇa)': in other words, we are here dealing purely with the mundane world of the beginner in meditation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n671" href="#fn671">671</a>]</sup> As in n.660.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n672" href="#fn672">672</a>]</sup> Dhammā (cf. n.635). The question is sometimes asked concerning the relation of the four foundations of mindfulness to the schema of the five aggregates (khandhas). The point is explained here by DA as follows: contemplation of body is concerned with the aggregate of materiality or form (rūpakkhandha); contemplation of feelings is concerned with the aggregate of feeling (vedanākkhandha); contemplation of mind is concerned with the aggregate of consciousness (viññāṇa-kkhandha); and contemplation of mind-objects concerns itself with the aggregates of perception and mental formations (saññā-, saṅkhāra-kkhandha).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n673" href="#fn673">673</a>]</sup> Kāma-cchanda. The terminology is different from the first statement in verse 12, which refers to a lustful mind (sarāgaɱ cittaɱ), but there is little difference in meaning. Both refer to sensual desire in general, including but by no means confined to sexual desire. It arises, according to DA, from wrong reflection on an object that is agreeable to the senses. In verse 12 the exercise, was simply to note the presence of such a state of mind, if it it was present. Here one goes further, and investigates how such a state arises, and how it can be got rid of, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n674" href="#fn674">674</a>]</sup> DA lists six methods for getting rid of sensuality: (1) 'Right reflection' on an unpleasing (asubha) object; (2) Developing jhāna, whereby the hindrance is suppressed; (3) Guarding the senses; (4) Moderation in eating; (5) The support of 'good friends' (kalyāṇa-mittatā); (6) Helpful conversation (sappāyakathā).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n675" href="#fn675">675</a>]</sup> Vyāpāda.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n676" href="#fn676">676</a>]</sup> Thīna-midha. The principal cure for this is the 'perception of light'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n677" href="#fn677">677</a>]</sup> Uddhacca-kukkucca.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n678" href="#fn678">678</a>]</sup> Vicikicchā. This includes doubt of the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, and also inability to distinguish that which is good from that which is not, etc. (cf. DN 1.2.24), i.e. both scepsis and vacillation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n679" href="#fn679">679</a>]</sup> The factors productive of the hindrances and of their disappearance. On these hindrances, see Nyāṇaponika Thera, The Five Mental Hindrances, Wheel Publ., BPS 1961.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n680" href="#fn680">680</a>]</sup> Pañc'upādāna-kkhandhā: 'The 5 aspects in which the Buddha has summed up all the physical and mental phenomena of existence, and which appear to the ignorant man as his Ego, or personality, to wit: (1) the Corporeality group (rūpa-kkhandha) [here called 'Form'] (2) the Feeling (vedanāḥ), (3) the Perceptionḥ (saññāḥ), (4) the Mental-Formationḥ (saṅkhāraḥ), (5) the Consciousness-group (viññāṇa-kkhandha)' (BDic).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n681" href="#fn681">681</a>]</sup> Rūpa: cf. n.337. Briefly defined in SN 22.56 as 'The four Great Elements [cf. n.70] and corporeality depending on them.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n682" href="#fn682">682</a>]</sup> Sanna. Defined at SN 22.79 as 'distinguishing a thing by its marks'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n683" href="#fn683">683</a>]</sup> Saṅkhāra-kkhandha. The term saṅkhāra has various meanings and as many translations (cf. n.52g). Here, it applies to the group of mental formations. Conventionally fifty in number, they embrace various factors including what we term the emotions (i.e. karmic reactions, wholesome or otherwise). The most important one is volition (cetarā), the basis of kamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n684" href="#fn684">684</a>]</sup> Viññāṇa: which is subdivided according to the six senses, mind being the sixth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n685" href="#fn685">685</a>]</sup> For fuller details see BDic under āyatana. They consist, as appears from the following, of sense-base (e.g. eye, mind) and its object (sight-objects, mind-objects).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n686" href="#fn686">686</a>]</sup> Rūpe (acc. pl. of rūpa in this specific sense): 'visible forms, sight-objects'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n687" href="#fn687">687</a>]</sup> Ten fetters are listed, which differ slightly from those given in connection with attaining to Stream-Entry, etc., being found in the Abhidhamma. They are: Sensuality, resentment (paṭigha), pride (māna), (wrong) views (diṭṭhi), doubt (vicikicchā), desire for becoming (bhavarāga), attachment to rites and rituals (sīlabbata-parāmāsa), jealousy (issa), avarice (macchariya) and ignorance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n688" href="#fn688">688</a>]</sup> Here 'body' is kāya in the specific sense of 'body-organ', i.e. the base of tactile contact. See BDic for further details.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n689" href="#fn689">689</a>]</sup> Described in detail at, e.g. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118">MN 118</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n690" href="#fn690">690</a>]</sup> Dhamma-vicaya: sometimes taken to mean 'investigation of the Doctrine', but the meaning is rather 'investigation of bodily and mental phenomena'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n691" href="#fn691">691</a>]</sup> Viriya. This corresponds to Right Effort in the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n696" href="#fn696">696</a>]</sup> Ayatanānaɱ paṭilābho. According to the formula of dependent origination, these six sense-bases arise dependent on mind-and-body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n698" href="#fn698">698</a>]</sup> Upāyāsa: usually translated 'despair', which does not at all agree with the definition given here or in PED. 'Despair' means giving up hope, which is not stated here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n699" href="#fn699">699</a>]</sup> Vyādhi: omitted in most MSS from the definition at the beginning of this verse, though as disease is such an obvious cause of suffering and occurs in other contexts, the omission is probably accidental, perhaps reflecting a lapse in the tradition of the Digha reciters (bhaāṇakas), such as is doubtless responsible for the omission of the six sense-bases in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15</a>.

Vibhava means (1) 'power, success, wealth', and some translators have wrongly taken this meaning here; (2) 'ceasing to become', i.e. extinction. This is undoubtedly the meaning here. But the vibhava meant in this sense is not the higher 'cessation' of Nibbāna, but the materialists' 'extinction' at death (cf. the Freudian 'death-wish').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n708" href="#fn708">708</a>]</sup> Sammā-diṭṭhi. This, or 'Right Seeing' is the literal rendering ('Right Vision' would be an unwise rendering, because liable to be misleading!). Diṭṭhi here is a singular, and denotes 'seeing things as they really are', whereas 'views' in the plural are always wrong. It should be noted that when not prefixed with the word sammā, diṭṭhi means 'speculative opinions', and the like, which are not based on 'seeing things as they really are'. The formal opposite of sammā, diṭṭhi is micchā-diṭṭhi, a term generally reserved for especially pernicious views (cf. n.245)ɱ Sammā, diṭṭhi and the rest are sometimes rendered 'Perfect View', and so on, but this only refers to the supramundane path as described in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p117">MN 117</a>ɱ</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n709" href="#fn709">709</a>]</sup> Sammā-sankappa: variously rendered as 'right aspiration, right motive', etc.</p>
