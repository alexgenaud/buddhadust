					Here, he has got rid of sensuality, ill-will, sloth-and-torpor, worry-and-flurry, and doubt;<br />
					(b) what six factors does he possess?<br />
					On seeing an object with the eye, hearing a sound ..., smelling a smell ..., tasting a flavour ..., touching a tangible object ..., or cognising a mental object with the mind, he is neither pleased nor displeased, but remains equable, mindful and clearly aware;<br />
					(c) how has he established the one guard?<br />
					By guarding his mind with mindfulness;<br />
					(d) what are the four supports?<br />
					He judges that one thing is to be pursued, one thing endured, one thing avoided, one thing suppressed (<i>as verse 1.11 (8)</i>);<br />
					(e) how has he got rid of individual beliefs (<i>panunna-pacceka-sacco</i>)?<br />
					Whatever individual beliefs are held by the majority of ascetics and Brahmins he has dismissed, abandoned, rejected, let go;<br />
					(f) how is he one who has quite abandoned quests?<br />
					He has abandoned the quest for sense-desires, for rebirth, for the holy life;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1131" href="#n1131">1131</a>]</sup></span><br />
					(g) how is he pure of motive?<br />
					He has abandoned thoughts of sensuality, ill-will, cruelty;<br />
					(h) how is he one who has tranquillised his emotions (<i>passaddha-kāya-sankhāro hoti</i>)?<br />
					Because, having given up pleasure and pain with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain which is purified by equanimity, and this is the fourth jhāna;<br />
					(i) how is he well emancipated in heart?<br />
					He is liberated from the thought of greed, hatred and delusion;<br />
					(j) how is he well liberated by wisdom? He understands: "For me greed, hatred and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, like a palm-tree stump, destroyed and incapable of growing again." <span class="f3"><b>[271]</b></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1124" href="#fn1124">1124</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammā</i> here clearly means 'things, factors', not 'doctrines' (RD).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1125" href="#fn1125">1125</a>]</sup> DA is doubtful whether <i>abhidhamma</i> here means 'the seven Pakararyas', i.e. the Abhidhamma Piṭaka as we know it, or not. The short answer is that if this text goes back to the Buddha's time (which is possible but far from certain), the word <i>abhidhamma</i> can only have the more general sense of 'higher teaching' or the like. Similar considerations apply to <i>abhivinaya</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1126" href="#fn1126">1126</a>]</sup> Cf. n.1074.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1127" href="#fn1127">1127</a>]</sup> Not 'objects for self-hypnosis' (RD). The <i>jhānas</i> differ from hypnotic trance in that one has full control and is not suggestible. I am indebted to Dr Nick Ribush for this valuable clarification (cf. n.211).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1128" href="#fn1128">1128</a>]</sup> There is some confusion about the last two members of this list. Elsewhere we find <i>āloka</i> 'light' instead of consciousness (the latter is difficult to envisage as a <i>kasiṇa</i>). See VM 5.26 and n.5 there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1129" href="#fn1129">1129</a>]</sup> Or 'sectarian opinions' (RD). Private aberrations of view.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1130" href="#fn1130">1130</a>]</sup> <i>Passaddha-kāya-sankhāro,</i> where <i>kāya</i> means the mental body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1131" href="#fn1131">1131</a>]</sup> Cf. 1.10 (22). Getting involved in problems about 'self', etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1132" href="#fn1132">1132</a>]</sup> Cf. n.542.</p>
