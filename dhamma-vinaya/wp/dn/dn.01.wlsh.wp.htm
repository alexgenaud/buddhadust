					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> 'At improper times' means between midday and the following dawn.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Verses 8-9 embrace the first four precepts undertaken by novices (<i>sāmaṇeras</i>). The elaboration of the different forms of wrong speech here (and elsewhere) reflects the importance of controlling the tongue. Curiously, there is no mention of abstaining from intoxicants, but instead a reference to 'damaging seeds and crops'. The next five items correspond to the novices' precepts 6-10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The Buddha did, however, accept land from Anathapiṇḍika and others for the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>Caṇḍālaɱ vaɱsaɱ dhopanaɱ:</i> rather obscure. The performers were presumably low-caste. DA thinks of an iron ball (used for juggling?).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Chess, with a board of 64 or 100 squares, originated in India. Though previously not unknown, it was popularised in Europe by the Crusaders.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>Tiracchāna-kathā:</i> lit. 'animal-talk'. As animals walk parallel to the earth, so this kind of talk does not lead upward (DA). See also <i>n.</i> 244.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> <i>Kaṇṇika-lakkhaṇaɱ:</i> from <i>kaṇṇa</i> 'ear'. <i>DA</i> thinks it means either ear-rings or house-gables, both of which are incongruous here. I follow the Thai translation which, probably following an old tradition, has <i>tun</i> 'bamboo-rat' (see McFarland, <i>Thai-English Dictionary,</i> p. 371).

					They are devas. In another sense, all <i>dhammas</i> are said to be mind-made (<i>Dhp.</i> 1-2).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Not requiring material food, but nourished by the <i>jhāna</i> factor <i>pīti</i> 'delight' (<i>n.</i> 81).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> Brahmā is allotted a relatively humble position, and his creator-role explained away, in Buddhism. See also <i>MN</i> 49.8 (= <i>MLS</i> i, 391).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> The life-span of beings is fixed in some realms, and variable in others. Merit (<i>puñña</i>) is karmically wholesome action, leading to a favourable rebirth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> Khiḍḍapadosikā: these devas and the next group are mentioned only here and in Suttas 20, 24. They illustrate the consequences of desire and aversion even in the (relatively) 'higher' worlds. Moral progress is virtually impossible outside the human state, so that they are actually fortunate to fall back to that state. Mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) is all-important. <i>DA</i> says the bodies of these devas are so delicate that if by forgetfulness they miss a single meal they will pass away from that place. Even if they eat immediately afterwards, it is too late!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> <i>Manopadosikā. DA</i> says these dwell on the plane of the Four Great Kings (i.e. only just above the human realm). Interestingly, if only one of the devas gets angry while the other remains calm, this prevents the first from passing away, which would seem to illustrate the sentiment of <i>Dhp.</i> 5, 6. These devas are not essentially different from those mentioned in verses 1-2, though on a lower level.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> <i>Citta:</i> more or less synonymous with mano 'mind', but often used much like 'heart' in English ('to know in one's heart', etc.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> <i>Antānantikā:</i> or 'Extensionists' (<i>RD</i>)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> <i>DA</i> associates these various views with the higher jhānas (see Introduction, p. 42), obtained with the aid of the <i>kasiṇas</i> (coloured discs, etc., <i>cf. VM</i> chs. 4, 5). <i>DA</i> says: '(1) Without having extended the counterpart sign to the boundaries of the world-sphere, he abides perceiving the world as finite. (2) But he who has extended the <i>kasiṇa</i>-image to the boundaries of the world-sphere perceives the world to be infinite. (3) Not extending the sign in the upward and downward directions, but extending it across, he perceives the world as finite in the upward and downward directions, and infinite across. (4) The rationalist doctrine should be understood by the method stated.' [This is unexplained, though the SubCommentary attempts an explanation: 'If the self were finite, its rebirth in distant places could not be recollected. And if it were infinite, one living in this world would be able to experience the happiness of the heavenly worlds and the suffering of the hells, etc. If one holds it to be both finite and infinite, one would incur the errors of both the previous positions. Therefore the self cannot be declared to be either finite or infinite.'] (Translated by BB, pp. 172, 171).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> <i>Amarā-vikheppikā</i> can be interpreted as either 'eel-wriggling' (RD) or 'endless equivocation' (BB): <i>amarā</i> (lit. 'deathless') is the name of a slippery fish, perhaps an eel, which escapes capture by wriggling (<i>DA</i>). A deliberate pun may well be intended.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Either for the higher training or for a heavenly rebirth (<i>DA</i>). <i>Cf.</i> verse 1.5, where the former is certainly meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Due to moral shame and moral dread (<i>hiri-ottappa</i>) (<i>DA</i>), <i>i.e.</i> shame at doing what is wrong, and dread of it. These two qualities are called 'guardians of the world' (cf. Ñyāṇaponika Thera, <i>Abhidhamma Studies,</i> 2nd. ed., Colombo 1965, p. 80). Thus it is recognised that the first three classes of 'eel-wrigglers' have a moral conscience. Their equivocation stems from lack of understanding, not of scruple.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> The following views are attributed in <i>DN</i> 2.31 <i>f.</i> to <i>Sañjaya</i> (see <i>n.</i> 13).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> The four 'alternatives' of Indian logic: a thing <i>(a)</i> is, <i>(b)</i> is not, <i>(c)</i> both is and is not, <i>(d)</i> neither is nor is not.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> Having attained a high absorption, and fearing the perils of conscious existence, they have wished for, and gained, an unconscious state. With the first stirring of perception, however, they fall away from that realm (<i>DA</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> The view of the Ājīvikas (<i>DA</i>): see <i>DN</i> 2.19-20 and <i>nn.</i> l02-109 there. <i>Cf.</i> A.L. Basham, <i>History and Doctrine of the Ājīvikas,</i> (London 1951).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> This is the view of the Jains. <i>DA</i> says the other views mentioned are based on various meditational experiences.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> The Sub-Commentary (see BB, p. 190) is helpful here: (1) is based on experience of the unconscious realm (see <i>n.</i> 65), (2) takes perception to be the self, (3) takes the material, or material and immaterial <i>dhammas</i> + perception to be the self, (4) is based on reasoning, (5-8) are to be understood as at <i>n.</i> 57.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> (1) is based on a subtle perception incapable of performing this function at death and rebirth-linking (see <i>n.</i> 125). The rest as in <i>n.</i> 68.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> 'Earth' (<i>pathavī</i>) or extension, 'water' (<i>āpo</i>) or cohesion, 'fire' (<i>tejo</i>) or temperature, 'air' (<i>vāyo</i>) or motion: the traditional names for the four qualities present, in varying proportions, in all matter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> In the Buddhist view, there is additionally required the presence of the <i>gandhabba</i> or 'being-to-be-born', <i>i.e.</i> the arising of a new 'continuity of consciousness' dependent on that of some being just deceased. <i>Cf. MN</i> 38.1-7. See p. 45.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> <i>Dibba</i> (Skt. <i>divya</i>): derived from the same stem as <i>deva: cf.</i> Latin <i>divus</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> Kāmâvacara: belonging to the sensuous sphere (<i>kāmaloka</i>), the lowest of the three worlds.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> <i>Kabalinkārâhāra</i> generally means 'material food'. Here it denotes the kind of nutriment on which the lower devas subsist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> DA says this one takes the divine form (<i>dibb'atthabhāva</i>), <i>i.e.</i> the form of the devas of the sensuous sphere, for the self. The assumption is that this survives the break-up of the physical body for a period of time (of unspecified duration), 'annihilation' occurring at its cessation, and similarly with the remaining 'selves'. As BB points out (p. 32), 'Only the first form of annihilationism is materialistic; six admit that the doctrine can take on a spiritual garb.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> 'Produced by the <i>jhāna</i>-mind' (OA).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> The next four correspond to the 4th-7th 'liberations' (<i>DN</i> 15.35) or the four higher, 'formless' jhānas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> This is not, of course, the real Nibbāna of Buddhism (see Introduction, p. 27). <i>DA</i> says it means the subsiding of suffering (<i>dukkhavūpasama</i>) in this very individual form (subsiding being something far short of cessation). The New Sub-Commentary (quoted by BB, p. 197) adds: 'It is not the supreme fruit and not the unconditioned element (<i>asankhata-dhātu = Nibbāna</i>), for these are beyond the domain of these theorists.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> The various jhānas are mistaken for Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> <i>Vitakka-vicāra:</i> otherwise rendered 'initial and sustained thought', and the like. I am indebted to L.S. Cousins for the suggestion that I should adopt the Ven. ñāṇamoli's original rendering 'thinking and pondering' (altered by the editor) in his <i>MN</i> translation (forthcoming). <i>Cf. n.</i> 61l.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> <i>Pīti:</i> a difficult word to translate. Renderings vary from 'interest' through 'zest' to 'rapture'. It is classified not as a feeling (<i>vedanā</i>) but as part of the group of mental formations (<i>sankhārā</i>), <i>i.e.</i> as a mental reaction. <i>BDic</i> says: 'It may be described psychologically as "joyful interest'" — for which the simplest term would seem to be 'delight'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> <i>Sukha:</i> pleasant feeling, physical or mental (though for the latter the word <i>somanassa</i> exists). The difference between this and <i>pīti</i> may seem subtle but is important.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> <i>Samādhi</i> here has its basic meaning of 'concentration'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> <i>Upekkhaka.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> <i>Sampajāna:</i> not 'self-possessed' as so many translators have repeated after RD.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> <i>Phassa</i> is the 'contact' between sense-base and its object, e.g. eye and visible object. Such contact is the basis of feeling (<i>vedanā</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body as base of the tactile sense, and mind (which is always the sixth sense in Buddhism).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> This is the first, partial, exposition of dependent origination (<i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i>) in the Canon. See Introduction, p. 34, and Suttas 14, 15.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> All that formerly bound him to the cycle of rebirth.</p>
