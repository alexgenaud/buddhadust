					<h1>III<br />
					Tevigga-Suttanta<br />
					On Knowledge of the Vedas</h1>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_159">159</a>]</p>

					<h3 class="ctr c"><a id="intro">Introduction</a><br />
					to the<br />
					Tevijja Sutta</h3>

					<p>This is the twelfth and last Sutta in the first division of the Dīgha Nikāya,<sup>[<a id="edfnIII.1" href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/rhyt.bs_-mo_notes.htm#ednIII.1">edfnIII.1</a>]</sup> which is called the Sīlakkhandha Vaggo, because the whole of its twelve Dialogues deal, from one point of view or another, with Sīla, or Right Conduct.</p>

					<p>There is another Sutta sometimes called by the same name, No. 21 in the Middle Fifty of the Majjhima Nikāya: but it has nothing, except the name, in common with the present. It is called Tevijja Sutta merely because Gotama is there described by the complimentary title of Tevijja, 'Wise in the Vedas;' and its full name is the Tevijja-vakkhagotta-sutta<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>I have made the present translation from a text constituted from three MSS., — my own MS. of the Dīgha Nikāya, referred to as D; the Turnour MS. of the same in the Indian Office, referred to as T; both in Sinhalese characters: and the Phayre MS. in the same place, in Burmese characters, referred to as P.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In this book we have Right Conduct used as a sort of argumentum ad hominem for the conversion of two earnest young <span class="mozp">Brāhmans</span>.</p>

					<p>They ask which is the true path to a state of union (in the next birth) with God. After arguing, in a kind of Socratic dialogue, that on their own showing, on the [<a id="page_160">160</a>] basis of facts they themselves admitted, the <span class="mozp">Brāhmans</span> could have no real knowledge of their God, Gotama maintains that union with a God whom they admitted to be pure and holy must be unattainable by men impure and sinful and self-righteous, however great their knowledge of the Vedas. And he then lays down, not without occasional beauty of language, that system of Right Conduct, which must be the only direct way to a real union with God.</p>

					<p>One would think perhaps that such a Sutta might be adapted, without very great difficulty, for use as a missionary tract, so closely does it remind us of the argument of many a sermon on the text, 'Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven!' And it is true that the Tevijjā — the men of special knowledge in the three Vedas — correspond exactly in most essential particulars with the Scribes and Pharisees of the New Testament. They were the official preservers by repeating, as the Scribes were by copying, the sacred books; and they were the recognised interpreters, and the sole custodians of the traditional interpretation — which too often explained away the real meaning — of those books. It follows that as the law in both cases was included in the sacred books, it was they who, in both cases, were the real lawgivers, and practically the only lawyers. And as almost all learning was confined to, or in close connection with the sacred books, the Tevijjā were the chief Paṇḍits, as the Scribes were the 'Doctors of the Law.' Like the Pharisees, too, the <span class="mozp">Brāhmans</span> laid claim to peculiar sanctity; and many of them in the pride of their education, their birth, and their wealth, looked down with self-righteous scorn on the masses of the people. And while, on the other hand, the <span class="mozp">Brāhmans</span> further resembled the Scribes and Pharisees in that many of them were justly deserving of the respect in which they were held; it is only the undeserving who, in both cases, are intended to be condemned.</p>

					<p>But whatever interpretation of the 'kingdom of heaven' [<a id="page_161">161</a>] the reader may adopt, it must be very different from anything the Sutta can mean by 'a state of union with Brahmā.' It is not easy to say what opinion is really imputed to the young <span class="mozp">Brāhmans</span> before their conversion. It is probably meant that they were seeking a way by which their Self should become identified, after death, with Brāhman; a way by which they could escape from the immortality of transmigration, from existence altogether as separate individuals<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup>. And in holding out a hope of union with Brahmā as a result of the practice of universal love<sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup>, the Buddha is most probably intended to mean 'a union with Brahmā' in the Buddhist sense — that is to say, a temporary companionship as a separate being with the Buddhist Brahmā, to be enjoyed by a new individual not consciously identical with its predecessor. It is just possible that the argumentum ad hominem should be extended to this part of the Sutta; and that the statement in III, 1 should be taken to mean, 'This (universal love) is the only way to that kind of union with your own Brahmā which you desire.' But such a yielding to heretical opinion at the close of his own exposition of the truth would scarcely be imputed to a Buddha.</p>

					<p>Just as during the time of the early Christians, in the way which Archbishop Trench has so instructively pointed out, it was not men only who received a new birth and a new baptism, but old words and terms of common use were also infused with a new spirit; so the Indian reformer, while clothing his new system in the current phraseology, infused a different and in many cases a higher meaning into the old expressions.</p>

					<p>Thus, for instance, Tevijja (Sanskrit Traividya) meant either knowledge of the Three Vedas, or as an adjective, a Brāhman possessed of that knowledge; and then, as a noun of multitude, such an assembly of those <span class="mozp">Brāhmans</span> [<a id="page_162">162</a>] as is described in the first sections of our Sutta. As there were many Brahmā who had not that knowledge, the word naturally came to imply a person worthy of the respect due to special learning, and was used as a complimentary title, not very different from our Doctor. It is preserved as an epithet of Arahats in the Buddhist writings, but as meaning one possessed of the knowledge of a fundamental threefold doctrine of Buddhism, the doctrine of the impermanency, the inherent pain, and the absence of any abiding principle (any Self) in the confections or component things<sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup>. That is to say, the knowledge of the Vedas was replaced by a knowledge of the real character of the deceptive and evanescent phenomena by which we are encircled, and of which we form a part.</p>

					<p>So also with regard to Brahmā. The name was retained, but the idea was entirely changed. The course of religious belief had passed among the Indian section of the Aryan tribes through the usual stages of animism and polytheism to a kind of pantheism peculiar to India, in which Brahman was held to be a first cause, the highest self, emotionless, infinite, absolute. As the Buddhist system was constructed without any use of the previous idea of a separate soul, or self, or ghost, or spirit, supposed to exist inside the human body, this woven chain of previous speculation had as little importance for it as theological discussions have for positivism. But Buddhism fell into what to the positivist would be the unpardonable sin — perhaps inevitable at the time and place of its youth — of continuing to express a belief in the external spirits, big and little, of the then Hindu pantheon.</p>

					<p>They were preserved very much in the previous order of precedence, and were all — except Māra, the Evil One, and his personal following, and a few others — supposed to be passably good Buddhists. They were not feared any more; they were patronized as a kind of fairies, usually beneficent, [<a id="page_163">163</a>] though always more or less foolish and ignorant. They were of course not worshipped any more, for they were much less worthy of reverence than any wise and good man. And they were not eternal, — all of them, even the very best or highest, being liable, like all things and all other creatures, to dissolution. If they had behaved well they were then reborn under happy outward conditions, and might even look forward to being some day born as men, so that they could attain to the supreme goal of the Buddhist faith, to that bliss which passeth not away, — the Nirvāṇa of a perfect life in Arahatship.</p>

					<p>The duty of a Buddhist who had entered the Noble Path towards these light and airy shapes — for to such vain things had the great gods fallen — was the same as his duty towards every fellow creature; pity for his ignorance, sympathy with his weakness, equanimity (the absence of fear or malice, or the sense of any differing or opposing interest), and the constant feeling of a deep and lasting love, all pervading, grown great, and beyond measure.</p>

					<p>No exception was made in the case of Brahmā. He, like every other creature that had life, was evanescent, was bound by the chain of existence, the result of ignorance, and could only find salvation by walking along the Noble Eightfold Path. It must be remembered that the Brahmā of modern times, the God of the ardent theism of some of the best of the later Hindus, had not then come into existence: that conception was one effect of the influence of Mohammadan and Christian thought upon Hindu minds. And it would be useless to conjecture how the Buddhist theory might have been modified by contact with that ideal.</p>

					<p>While regarded however as essentially of the same class as all other external spirits, Brahmā was still regarded as a superior spirit, as a very devout Buddhist, and as a kind of king among the angels. The Brahmā of this world system, who was living in Gotama's time, and who is living now, acquired his present exalted position from his virtue in a previous birth as a Bhikkhu named Sahaka [<a id="page_164">164</a>] in the time when Kassapa Buddha's religion flourished upon earth<sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup>. According to the author of the Jātaka commentary, he assisted at the future Buddha's birth<sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup>; and twice afterwards he rendered service to the Bodisat just before the great conflict with Māra<sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup>. And when after the victory the Blessed One hesitated whether it would be of any use to tell to others the truth he had found, it was Brahmā who appeared and besought him to proclaim the truth<sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup>. Brahmā Sahampati was the first to give utterance to the universal sorrow which followed on the death of the Buddha<sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup>; and at a critical period in the later history of the Buddhist church he is represented to have descended from heaven, and to have appeared to the Thera Sā'ha, to confirm his wavering faith<sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>These instances will show the high character ascribed to the Brahmā of the world system in which we live; and in each of the infinite world systems which are scattered through space there is supposed to be a like finite, temporary, virtuous Brahmā sitting as king over the most exalted of the angel hosts.</p>

					<p>It must be evident that it follows, without the possibility of question, that the early Buddhists cannot with any accuracy be described as 'monotheists,' and it is much to be regretted that even cultured and scholarly writers still speak of them as such, and can suggest that the independent monotheism of the later Jews can be paralleled by a supposed monotheism among the Buddhists<sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>And even if the idea of Brahmā were at all the same as the idea of God, a union with this Brahmā would mean a merely temporary life as an angel in the Brahmā heaven — such a life as is represented below to have been the result [<a id="page_165">165</a>] of the noble life and noble thoughts of the Great King of Glory. But this was not the supreme goal of the Buddhist faith; and the angel, though the same person as the king, from the Buddhist point of view (as resulting from, and carrying on, the same Karma), would be a different person from the king, according to the Christian point of view; for there is no mention of the passage of a soul from the earth to heaven, no conscious identity, no continuing memory.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>We may draw, from the above, two conclusions. Firstly, that the use of a word in Sanskrit authors is but very little guide to the meaning of the corresponding word in the Pāli Buddhist scriptures whenever the word has reference to an idea of a religious character.</p>

					<p>And, secondly, that very little reliance can be placed, without careful investigation, on a resemblance — however close at first sight-between a passage in the Pāli Piṭakas and a passage in the New Testament.</p>

					<p>It is true that many passages in these two literatures can be easily shown to have a similar tendency. But when some writers on the basis of such similarities proceed to argue that there must have been some historical connection between the two, and that the New Testament, as the later, must be the borrower, I venture to think that they are wrong. There does not seem to me to be the slightest evidence of any historical connection between them; and whenever the resemblance is a real one — and it often turns out to be really least when it first seems to be greatest, and really greatest when it first seems least — it is due, not to any borrowing on the one side or on the other, but solely to the similarity of the conditions under which the two movements grew.</p>

					<p>This does not of course apply to the later literature of the two religions; and it ought not to detract from the very great value and interest of the parallels which may be adduced from the earlier books. If we wish to understand what it was that gave such life and force to the stupendous movement which is called Buddhism, we [<a id="page_166">166</a>] cannot refrain from comparing it — not only in the points in which it agrees with it, but also in the points in which it differs from it — with our own faith. I trust I have not been wrong in making use occasionally of this method, though the absence of any historical connection between the New Testament and the Pāli Piṭakas has always seemed to me so clear, that it would be unnecessary to mention it. But when a reviewer who has been kind enough to appreciate, I am afraid too highly, what he calls my 'service in giving, for the first time, a thoroughly human, acceptable, and coherent' account of the 'life of Buddha,' and of the 'simple groundwork of his religion' has gone on to conclude that the parallels I had thus adduced are 'an unanswerable indication of the obligations of the New Testament to Buddhism,' I must ask to be allowed to enter a protest against an inference which seems to me to be against the rules of sound historical criticism.<sup>[<a id="edfnIII.2" href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/rhyt.bs_-mo_notes.htm#ednIII.2">edfnIII.2</a>]</sup></p>

					<h1>On Knowledge of the Vedas.<br />
					Tevijja Sutta</h1>

					<h4 class="ctr c">Chapter I</h4>

					<p><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.13.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.13.rhyt.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> H<span class="f2">AVE</span> I H<span class="f2">EARD</span>. At one time when the Blessed One was journeying through Kosala with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Brāhman village in Kosala which is called Manasākaṭa. And there at Manasākaṭa the Blessed One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the south of Manasākaṭa<sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmā were staying at Manasākaṭa — to wit, Caŋkī the Brāhman, Tārukkha the Brāhman, Pokkharasāti the Brāhman, Gāṇussoṇi the Brāhman, Todeyya the Brāhman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmā<sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_168">168</a>] 3. Now a conversation sprung up between <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja</span>, when they were taking exercise (after their bath) and walking up and down in thoughtful mood, as to which was the true path, and which the false<sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>4. The young Brāhman <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha</span> spake thus:</p>

					<p>'This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā<sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup> — I mean that which has been announced by the Brāhman Pokkarasāti.'</p>

					<p>5. The young Brāhman Bhāradvāja spake thus:</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_169">169</a>] 'This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā — I mean that which has been announced by the Brāhman Tārukkha.'</p>

					<p>6. But neither was the young Brāhman <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha</span> able to convince the young Brāhman Bhāradvāja, nor was the young Brāhman Bhāradvāga able to convince the young Brāhman <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha.</span></p>

					<p>7. Then the young Brāhman <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha</span> said to the young Brāhman Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p>'That Samaṇa Gotama, Bhāradvāja, of the Sakya clan, who left the Sakya tribe to adopt the religious life, is now staying at Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove, on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the south of Manasākaṭa. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad, that he is said to be "a fully enlightened one, blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the world, unsurpassed as a guide to erring mortals, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha<sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup>." Come, then, Bhāradvāga, let us go to the place where the Samaṇa Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the Samaṇa Gotama touching this matter. What the Samaṇa Gotama shall declare unto us, that let us bear in mind.'</p>

					<p>'Very well, my friend!' said the young Brāhman Bhāradvāja, in assent, to the young Brāhman <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha</span>.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>8. Then the young Brāhman Vāseṭṭha and the young Brāhman Bhāradvāja went on to the place where the Blessed One was.</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_170">170</a>] And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of friendship and civility, and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p>And while they were thus seated the young Brāhman <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha</span> said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p>'As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path and which the false. I said thus:</p>

					<p>'"This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā — I mean that which has been announced by the Brāhman Pokkarasāti."</p>

					<p>'Bhāradvāga said thus:</p>

					<p>'"This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā — I mean that which has been announced by the Brāhman Tārukkha."</p>

					<p>'Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between us.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>9. 'So you say, Vāseṭṭha, that you said thus:</p>

					<p>'"This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā — I mean that which has been announced by the Brāhman Pokkarasāti."</p>

					<p>'While Bhāradvāja said thus:</p>

					<p>'"This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā — I mean that which has been announced by the Brāhman Tārukkha."</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_171">171</a>]</p>

					<p>'Wherein, then, O <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha,</span> is there a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between you<sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup>?'</p>

					<p>10. 'Concerning the true path and the false, Gotama. Various Brahmā, Gotama, teach various paths — the Addhariya Brahmā, the Tittiriya Brahmā, the <i>Kh</i>andoka Brahmā, the <i>Kh</i>andava Brahmā, the Brahmacariya Brahmā<sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup>. Are all those saving paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with Brahmā?</p>

					<p>'Just, Gotama, as near a village or a town there are many and various paths<sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup>, yet they all meet together in the village — just in that way are all the various paths taught by various Brahmā — the Addhariya Brahmā, the Tittiriya  Brahmā, the <i>Kh</i>andoka Brahmā, the <i>Kh</i>andava Brahmā, the Brahmacariya Brahmā. Are all these saving paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with Brahmā?'</p>

					<p>11. 'Do you say that they all lead aright, <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha?</span></p>

					<p>'I say so, Gotama.'</p>

					<p>'Do you really say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?'</p>

					<p>'So I say, Gotama.'</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_172">172</a>] 12. 'But then, Vāseṭṭha, is there a single one of the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas who has ever seen Brahmā face-to-face?'</p>

					<p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

					<p>'But is there then, Vāseṭṭha, a single one of the teachers of the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?'</p>

					<p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

					<p>'But is there then, Vāseṭṭha, a single one of the pupils of the teachers of the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?'</p>

					<p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

					<p>'But is there then, Vāseṭṭha, a single one of the Brahmā up to the seventh generation who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?'</p>

					<p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

					<p>13. 'Well then, Vāseṭṭha, those ancient <i>Ri</i>shis of the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose ancient form of words so chaunted, uttered, or composed, the Brahmā of to-day chaunt over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited — to wit, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aŋgirasa, Bhāradvāja, <span class="mozp">Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu</span><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup> — did even they speak thus, saying: "We know it, we have seen it, where Brahmā is, whence Brahmā is, whither Brahmā is?"'</p>

					<p>'Not so, Gotama!'</p>

					<p>14. 'Then you say, Vāseṭṭha [that not one of the Brahmā, or of their teachers, or of their pupils, even up to the seventh generation, has ever seen Brahmā face-to-face. And that even the <i>Ri</i>shis of [<a id="page_173">173</a>] old, the authors and utterers of the verses, of the ancient form of words which the Brahmā of to-day so carefully intone and recite precisely as they have been handed down — even they did not pretend to know or to have seen where or whence or whither Brahmā is]<sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup>. So that the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas have forsooth said thus: "What we know not, what we have not seen, to a state of union with that we can show the way, and can say: 'This is the straight path, this is the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā!'"</p>

					<p>'Now what think you, Vāseṭṭha? Does it not follow, this being so, that the talk of the Brahmā, versed though they be in the Three Vedas, is foolish talk?'</p>

					<p>'In sooth, Gotama, that being so, it follows that the talk of the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas is foolish talk!'</p>

					<p>15. 'Verily, Vāseṭṭha, that Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas should be able to show the way to a state of union with that which they do not know, neither have seen — such a condition of things has no existence!</p>

					<p>'Just, Vāseṭṭha, as when a string of blind men are clinging one to the other<sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup>, neither can the foremost [<a id="page_174">174</a>] see, nor can the middle one see, nor can the hindmost see — just even so, methinks, Vāseṭṭha, is the talk of the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas but blind talk: the first sees not, the middle one sees not, nor can the latest see. The talk then of these Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas turns out to be ridiculous, mere words, a vain and empty thing!'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>16. 'Now what think you, Vāseṭṭha? Can the Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas — like other, ordinary, folk — see the sun and the moon as they pray to, and praise, and worship them, turning round with clasped hands towards the place whence they rise and where they set?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly, Gotama, they [can]<sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup>.'</p>

					<p>17. 'Now what think you, Vāseṭṭha? The Brahmā versed in the Three Vedas, who can very well — like other, ordinary, folk — see the sun and the moon as they pray to, and praise, and worship them, turning round with clasped hands to the place whence they rise and where they set — are those Brahmā, versed in the Three Vedas, able to point out the way to a state of union with the sun or the moon, saying: "This is the straight path, this the direct way which leads him, who acts according to it, to a state of union with the sun or the moon?"'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Gotama!'</p>

					<p>18. 'So you say, Vāseṭṭha, that the Brahmā [are not able to point out the way to union with that [<a id="page_175">175</a>] which they have seen], and you further say that [neither any one of them, nor of their pupils, nor of their predecessors even to the seventh generation has ever seen Brahmā].

					<p>'So be it, Lord!' said the young Brāhman Vāseṭṭha, in assent, to the Blessed One.</p>

He, by himself, thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were, face-to-face this universe — the world below with all its spirits, and the worlds above, of Mara and of Brahma — and all creatures, Samaṇas and Brahmā, gods and men, and he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he proclaim both in its letter and in its spirit, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its perfectness.</p>

					<p>47. 'A householder (gahapati), or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth<sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup>. On hearing the truth he has faith in the Tathāgata, and when he has acquired that faith he thus considers with himself:</p>

					<p>'"Full of hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passion: free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things. How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in the [<a id="page_188">188</a>] orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from a household life into the homeless state!"</p>

					<p>48.

					<p>49. 'When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life self-restrained according to the rules of the Pātimokkha; uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid; he adopts and trains himself in the precepts; he encompasses himself with holiness in word and deed; he sustains his life by means that are quite pure; good is his conduct, guarded the door of his senses; mindful and self-possessed, he is altogether happy<sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup>!'</p>

Hiouen Thsang mentions a river A-chi-lo-fa-ti, which is doubtless the same. It is evidently the river on which stood the town of Sāvatthi, and near to which lay the Jetavana monastery (see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 331); and it must therefore, in accordance with Burnouf's conjecture, be the Rapti, which is the Sanskrit Irāvati. The Phayre Burmese MS. has almost always Acīravatī.</p>

					Pokkharasādi (sic MS.) lived at Ukkaṭṭha,<br />
					Jānussoṇi lived at Sāvatthi, and<br />
					Todeyya lived at Tudigāma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is some difference in the MSS. as to the spelling of these names: T. reads Caŋkī; P. T. and D. Pokkharasāti (Sanskrit Paushkarasādi); P. Jānuyoni, T. Jāṇusoṇi, D. Jānusoni; P. Toreyya, and Burnouf Nodeyya (which is possibly merely a misreading). Gāṇusoṇi was converted by the Bhaya-bherava Sutta, and I think it very probable that the other names are also those of subsequent converts.<br />
					Buddhaghosa adds that because Manasākaṭa was a pleasant place the Brahmā had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their mantras.]</p>

The Phayre MS. has replaced veṇī by paveṇī, after the constant custom of the Burmese MSS. to improve away unusual or difficult expressions. Buddhaghosa explains andhaveṇi by andhapaveṇi, and tells a tale of a wicked wight, who meeting a company of blind men, told them of a certain village wherein plenty of good food was to be had. When they besought him for hire to lead them there, be took the money, made one blind man catch hold of his stick, the next of that one, and so on, and then led them on till they came to a wilderness. There he deserted them, and they all — still {footnote p. 174} holding each the other, and vainly, and with tears, seeking both their guide and the path — came to a miserable end!</p>

					The text repeats at length the words of §§ 12, 13, 14.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup>Samatittikā kākapeyyā, a stock phrase used of a river in flood time. Buddhaghosa says, Samatittikā ti samaharitā (sic ? samāharitā): kākapeyyā ti yatthakatthaci tīre <i>th</i>itena kākena sakkā pātun ti kākapeyyā, which does not seem to me to solve the question as to the origin and history of these difficult terms. With respect to the right form of samatittikā it should be noticed that the northern Buddhist spelling is samatīrthakā (Sukhavatīvyūha, ed. Max Müller in J. R. A. S. for 1880, p. 182), and that both Childers and Oldenberg have read samatitthikā in the Burmese MSS. of Mahāparinibbāna Sutta I, 33 = Mahā Vagga VI, 28. Now the difference in Burmese letters between tt and tth (### and ###) is so very small that the copyists frequently write one for the other; and even in good MSS. where the two are not confounded, it is sometimes difficult to tell which is really meant. When talking of rivers the mention of titthas seems so appropriate {footnote p. 179} that a copyist, and especially a Burmese copyist, would naturally read a doubtful combination as tth; so that even if all Burmese MSS. spell this word with tth (which is by no means certain), very little reliance should be placed upon the fact. On the other hand, the distinction in Sinhalese between tt and tth is very marked (### and ###) and the Sinhalese MSS. all read tt. I think therefore that Childers was right in finally adopting samatittikā as the correct Pāli form. In the numerous words in which Buddhist Sanskrit has a form differing in a way which sets philological rules at defiance from the corresponding Pāli form, Childers thought (see Dict. p. xi, where the list of words might be greatly extended) that the Sanskrit was always derived from the Pāli, and the Sanskrit writers had merely blundered. I venture, with great diffidence, to doubt this. It seems more likely that, at least in many instances, both Pāli and Sanskrit were alike derived from a previous Prākrit form, and that in differently interpreting a difficult word, both Sanskrit and Pāli authors made mistakes. That may be the case here; and it is almost certain that the original word had nothing to do with tīrtha. How easily this idea could be adopted we see from the fact that Childers when first editing the MSS. (in the J. R. A. S. for 1874), and when he had only Sinhalese MSS. then before him, altered their reading into samatitthikā, and put this form into his Dictionary; though he afterwards (in the separate edition), and after noting that reading in the Phayre MS., chose the other. But what, after all, does 'having equal or level tīrthas or landing-places' mean, when spoken of a river? Comp. Samatittikaɱ bhu<i>ñg</i>āmi (Mil. 213, 214); Sabbato tittaɱ pokkharaṇiɱ (Jāt. I, 339, text titthaɱ); and Samatittiko telapatto (ibid. 393, text ºiyo, but see p. 400). The root perhaps is TR<i>I</i>P.<br />
					Kākapeyya, according to Buddhaghosa, would mean 'crow-drinkable.' Crows do not drink on the wing; and they could stand to drink either when a river actually overflowed its banks and formed shallows on the adjoining land; or when in the hot season it had formed shallows in its own bed. 'Crow-drinkable' might mean therefore just as well 'shallow' as 'overflowing.' Had the word originally anything to do with kāka after all?]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup>The Sinhalese MSS. omit Mahiddhi and Yama, but repeat the verb 'we call upon' three times after Brahmā. It is possible that the Burmese copyist has wrongly inserted them to remove the strangeness of this repetition. The comment is silent.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup>ṭvaraṇā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup>Nīvaraṇā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup>Sapariggaho vā Brahmā apariggaho vā ti. Buddhaghosa says on Vāseṭṭha's reply, 'Kāmakkhandassa abhāvato itthipariggaheno apariggaho,' thus restricting the 'possession' to women, with especial reference to the first 'hindrance;' but the word in the text, though doubtless alluding to possession of women in particular, includes more. Compare, on the general idea of the passage, the English expression 'no encumbrances.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup>Asaŋkiliṭṭha-citto. That is, says Buddhaghosa, 'free from mental sloth and idleness, self-righteous ness, and pride.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup>Vasavattī vi avasavattī va. Buddhaghosa says, in explanation of the answer: 'By the absence of doubt he has his mind under control' (vase vatteti). Āsīditva saɱsīdanti. I have no doubt the commentator is right in his explanation of these figurative expressions. Confident in their knowledge of the Vedas, and in their practice of Vedic ceremonies, they neglect higher things; and so, sinking into sin and superstition, 'they are arriving only at despair, thinking the while that they are crossing over into some happier land.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup>From here down to the end of p. 200 is a repetition word for {footnote p. 187} word of <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">Sāmañña Phala Sutta,</a> pp. 133 and following; including the passages there parallel to those in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p10">Subha Sutta,</a> p. 157, and in <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Brahma-jāla Sutta</a>, pp. 5-16.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup>See above, § 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup>The point is, that the acceptance of this 'Doctrine and Discipline' is open to all, not of course that Brahmā never accept it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup>The argument is resumed after the Three Sīlas, or Descriptions of Conduct — a text, doubtless older than the Suttas in which it occurs, setting forth the distinguishing moral characteristics of a member of the Order.<br />
					The First is an expansion of the Ten Precepts ('Buddhism,' p. 160), but omitting the fifth, against the use of intoxicating drinks. The Second is a further expansion of the first and then of the last four, and finally of the fourth Precept. The Third  is directed against auguries, divinations, prophecies, astrology, quackery, ritualism, and the worship of Gods (including Brahmā).<br />
					These Three may perhaps have been inserted in the Sutta as a kind of counterpoise to the Three Vedas. Our Sutta really reads better without them; but they are interesting in themselves, and the third is especially valuable as evidence of ancient customs and beliefs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup>There is no division into actual chapters in the original, but it is convenient to arrange the following enumeration of moral precepts separately, as they occur in various suttas in the same order — and are always divided into the three divisions of Lower, Medium, and Higher Morality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup>The clause 'this, too, is the kind of goodness that he has' is repeated in the text after each section. The clause, which differs {footnote p. 190} in the different suttas in which this enumeration of Buddhist morality is found, is distinct from the enumeration itself, and, like the opening reference to Vāseṭṭha, characteristic only of the particular Sutta.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup>This paragraph occurs frequently; see, inter alia, below, Mahā-Sudassana Sutta II, 8. It will be seen from 'Buddhism,' pp. 170, 171, that these meditations play a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. All five are practised in Siam (Alabaster, 'Wheel of the Law,' p. 168).]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup>Or 'Member of our Order.' See the note on Mahāparinibbāna Sutta I, 6.]</p>
