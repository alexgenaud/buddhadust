					<h3 class="ctr c">Introduction</h3>

					<p>Dr. Morris, who had borrowed the Phayre and Turnour MSS. of the Magghima Nikāya from the India Office Library, has been good enough to transcribe the text of this Sutta for me.</p>

					<p>I had hoped from the Rev. David da Silva's analysis of the Sutta in the Ceylon Friend for 1872, that it would determine the exact meaning of the difficult word Āsava as used in the theory of Arahatship, and in the important passage (the Faith, Reason, and Works paragraph) repeated so often in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta. It will be seen that this is scarcely the case, but as it does throw light on the ideas wrapped up in the word, and contains a very interesting passage<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup> on the especial value attached in Buddhism to the mental habit we should now call agnosticism, I have adhered to the intention of including it in this volume.</p>

					<p>The word Āsava seems in this Sutta to be used in a general sense, — not confined only to the Āsavas of sensuality, individuality, delusion, and ignorance, but including the more various defilements or imperfections of mind, out of which those especial defilements will proceed.</p>

					<p>Incidentally reference is made to the well-known Buddhist doctrine, that the right thing is to seek after the Nirvāṇa of a perfect life in Arahatship, and not to trouble and confuse oneself by the discussion of speculative questions as to past or future existence, or even as to the [<a id="page_294">294</a>] presence within the body of a soul. Buddhism is not only independent of the theory of soul, but regards the consideration of that theory as worse than profitless, as the source of manifold delusions and superstitions. Practically this comes, however, to much the same thing as the denial of the existence of the soul; just as agnosticism is, at best, but an earnest and modest sort of atheism. And we have seen above that anattam, the absence of a soul or self as abiding principle, is one of the three parts of Buddhist wisdom (vijjā)<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> and of Buddhist perception (saññā)<sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup>. The reconciliation of these two doctrines, of the agnosticism and of the denial, is, I think, that the absence of soul is only predicated of those five Aggregates of parts and powers to which a good Buddhist should confine his attention. These alone he should consider; and he does wrong to care whether beyond and beside them a soul has, or has not, any real existence.<sup>[<a id="edfnVII.1" href="../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/rhyt.bs_-mo_notes.htm#ednVII.1">edfnVII.1</a>]</sup></p>

					<p>I may add that the importance of the Āsavas appears from the fact that elsewhere the knowledge of them, of their origin, of their cessation, and of the way that leads to their cessation is placed on the road to Arahatship immediately after, and parallel to, the knowledge of Suffering, of its origin, of its cessation, and of the way that leads to its cessation — the knowledge, that is, of the four Noble Truths<sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>The Āsavas there meant are sensuality, individuality (or life), and ignorance; and the expressions 'to him who knows, to him who sees' (jānato passato) are used there much in the same way as they are in our § 3. Perhaps this was the passage which Burnouf had in his mind when he wrongly said<sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup> that he had found in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta an enumeration of three classes of Āsavas, whereas that Sutta always divides them into four classes.</p>

					<p>I am unable to suggest any good translation of the term itself — simple though it is. It means literally 'a running or flowing,' or (thence) 'a leak;' but as that figure is not [<a id="page_295">295</a>] used in English in a spiritual sense, it is necessary to choose some other figure and it is not easy to find one that is appropriate. 'Sin' would be very misleading, the Christian idea of sin being inconsistent with Buddhist ethics. A 'fault' in the geological use of the word comes somewhat nearer. 'Imperfection' is too long, and for 'stain' the Pāli has a different word<sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup>. In the Book of the Great Decease I have chosen 'evil;' here I leave the word untranslated.</p>

And what do I say, brethren, is the destruction of the Āsavas to him who knows, to him who sees? It is (a matter of) wise consideration, and of foolish consideration.</p>

					<p>3. 'In him, brethren, who considers unwisely, Āsavas which have not arisen spring up, and Āsavas which have arisen are increased. In him, brethren, who considers wisely, Āsavas which have not arisen [<a id="page_297">297</a>] spring not up, and Āsavas which have arisen do not increase.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>4. 'There are Āsavas which should be abandoned, brethren, by insight,<br />
					there are Āsavas which should be abandoned by subjugation,<br />
					there are Āsavas which should be abandoned by right use,<br />
					there are Āsavas which should be abandoned by endurance,<br />
					there are Āsavas which should be abandoned by avoidance,<br />
					there are Āsavas which should be abandoned by removal,<br />
					there are Āsavas which should be abandoned by cultivation.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>5. 'And which, brethren, are the Āsavas which should be abandoned by insight<sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup>?'</p>

					<p>'In the first place, brethren, the ignorant unconverted man, who perceives not the Noble Ones, who comprehends not, nor is trained according to the doctrine of the noble ones; who perceives not good men, who comprehends not, nor is trained according to the doctrine of good men; he neither understands what things ought to be considered, nor what things ought not to be considered; the things that ought not to be considered, those he considers; and the things that ought to be considered, those he does not consider.</p>

					<p>6. 'And which, brethren, are those things which he should not consider, which he nevertheless considers?</p>

					<p>'There are things which, when a man considers them, the Āsava of Lust springs up within him, which had not sprung up before; and the Āsava of Lust, which had sprung up, grows great; the Āsava of [<a id="page_298">298</a>] Life springs up within him, which had not sprung up before; and the Āsava of Life, which had sprung up, grows great; the Āsava of Ignorance springs up within him, which had not sprung up before; and the Āsava of Ignorance, which had sprung up grows great.</p>

					<p>'These are the things which ought not to be considered, things which he considers.</p>

					<p>7. 'And which, brethren, are those things which should be considered, which he nevertheless does not consider?</p>

					<p>'There are things, brethren, which, when a man considers them, the Āsava of Lust, if it had not sprung up before, springs not up within him; and the Āsava of Lust, which had sprung up, is put away; the Āsava of Life, if it had not sprung up before, springs not up within him; and the Āsava of Life, which had sprung up, is put away; the Āsava of Ignorance, if it had not sprung up before, springs not up within him; and the Āsava of Ignorance, which had sprung up, is put away.</p>

					<p>'These are the things which ought to be considered, things which he does not consider.</p>

					<p>8. 'It is by his consideration of those things, which ought not to be considered; and by his non-consideration of those things, which ought to be considered, that Āsavas arise within him which had not sprung up; and Āsavas which had sprung up, grow great.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>9. 'Unwisely doth he consider thus:</p>

					<p>'"Have I existed during the ages that are past, or have I not? What was I during the ages that are past? How was I during the ages that are [<a id="page_299">299</a>] past? Having been what, what did I become in the ages that are past? Shall I exist during the ages of the future, or shall I not? What shall I be during the ages of the future? How shall I be during the ages of the future? Having been what, what shall I become during the ages of the future?"</p>

					<p>'Or he debates within himself as to the present:</p>

					<p>Do I after all exist, or am I not? How am I? This is a being; whence now did it come, and whither will it go?</p>

					<p>10. 'In him, thus unwisely considering, there springs up one or other of the six (absurd) notions<sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p>'As something true and real he gets the notion, "I have a self!"</p>

					<p>'As something true and real he gets the notion, "I have not a self!"</p>

					<p>'As something true and real he gets the notion, "By my self, I am conscious of my self!"</p>

					<p>'As something true and real he gets the notion, "By myself I am conscious of my non-self!"</p>

					<p>'Or, again, he gets the notion, "This soul of mine can be perceived, it has experienced the result of good and evil actions committed here and there: now this soul of mine is permanent, lasting, eternal, has the inherent quality of never changing, and will continue for ever and ever!"</p>

					<p>11. 'This, brethren, is called the walking in delusion, the jungle of delusion<sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup>, the wilderness of delusion, the puppet show of delusion, the writhing of delusion, the fetter of delusion.</p>

					<p>12. 'Bound, brethren, with this fetter of delusion, [<a id="page_300">300</a>] the ignorant unconverted man becomes not freed from birth, decay, and death, from sorrows, lamentations, pains, and griefs, and from expedients<sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup> — he does not become free, I say, from pain.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>13. 'But the wise man, brethren, the disciple walking in the Noble Path, who perceives the noble ones; who comprehends, and is trained according to, the doctrine of the Noble Ones; who perceives good men, who comprehends, and is trained according to, the doctrine of good men; he understands both what things ought to be considered, and what things ought not to be considered — and thus understanding, the things that ought to be considered those he considers; and the things that ought not to be considered, those he does not consider.</p>

					<p>14, 'And which, brethren, are those things which ought not to be considered, and which he does not consider?</p>

					<p>'There are things which, when a man considers them, the Āsava of Lust springs up within him, which had not sprung up before; and the Āsava of Lust, which had sprung up, grows great; the Āsava of Life springs up within him, which had not sprung up before; and the Āsava of Life, which had sprung up, grows great; the Āsava of Ignorance springs up within him, which had not sprung up before; and the Āsava of Ignorance, which had sprung up, grows great.</p>

					<p>'These are the things which ought not to be considered, things which he considers.</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_301">301</a>] 15. 'And which, brethren, are those things which should be considered, and which he does consider?</p>

					<p>'There are things, brethren, which, when a man considers them, the Āsava of Lust, if it had not sprung up before, springs not up within him; and the Āsava of Lust, which had sprung up, is put away; the Āsava of Life, if it had not sprung up before, springs not up within him; and the Āsava of Life, which had sprung up, is put away; the Āsava of Ignorance, if it had not sprung up before, springs not up within him; and the Āsava of Ignorance, which had sprung up, is put away.</p>

					<p>'These are the things which ought to be considered, things which he does not consider.</p>

					<p>16. 'It is by his not considering those things which ought to be considered, and by his considering those things which ought not to be considered, that Āsavas which had not sprung up within him spring not up, and Āsavas which had sprung up are put away.</p>

					<p>17. 'He considers, "This is suffering." He considers, "This is the origin of suffering." He considers, "This is the cessation of suffering." He considers, "This is the way which leads to the cessation of suffering." And from him, thus considering, the three fetters fall away — the delusion of self, hesitation, and the dependence on rites and ceremonies.</p>

					<p>These are the Āsavas, brethren, which are to be abandoned by insight.</p>
