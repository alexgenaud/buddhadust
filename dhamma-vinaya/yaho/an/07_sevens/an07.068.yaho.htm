					<h4>Translators' note</h4>

					<p>In this sutta, from the Aŋguttara Nikāya's Book of the Sevens, the Buddha compares seven pairs of situations a monk might hypothetically face and asks the monks to choose which of each pair is the better. While listening to the Buddha's explanations of the correct choice in each case, sixty monks become enlightened —  another instance of enlightenment directly from hearing a talk by the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Blessed One was wandering among the <a id="kosala">Kosala</a> people together with a large company of monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Entering a major path, the Blessed One saw in a certain spot a great mass of fire, burning, blazing, glowing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After seeing it and stepping down from the path he sat on the appointed seat at the root of a tree.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After sitting down the Blessed One said to the monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Do you see, monks, that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, glowing?" —</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable Sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">[1] "What do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Embracing that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, glowing, and sitting or lying down close to it?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or, embracing a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet, and sitting or lying down close to her?" —</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This, venerable Sir, would surely be the better:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Embracing a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet, and sitting or lying down close to her.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For it would be painful, venerable Sir, to embrace that great, burning, blazing, glowing mass of fire, and sit or lie down close to it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let me tell you, monks, let me explain to you, monks, that this would surely be the better for one who is of poor conduct, an evil-minded one, a filthy doer of complete wickedness who acts in an underhand manner, who pretends to be a recluse yet is not a recluse, who pretends to lead the holy life yet does not lead the holy life, an inwardly-putrid, impure-natured one:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Embracing that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, glowing, and sitting or lying down close to it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because on account of that, monks, he would go to death, or to a pain like that of death, but he would not, on account of that, on the break-up of the body after death be reborn into a place of woe, a realm of misery, a place of suffering, a purgatory."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, monks, if one who is of poor conduct, an evil-minded one, a filthy doer of complete wickedness who acts in an underhand manner, who pretends to be a recluse yet is not a recluse, who pretends to lead the holy life yet does not lead the holy life, an inwardly-putrid, impure-natured one, were to embrace a kshatriya or brahman or householder woman with young and tender hands and feet, and sit or lie down close to her — for him, monks, there would be a long period of harm and suffering, and on the break-up of the body after death he would be reborn into a place of woe, a realm of misery, a place of suffering, a purgatory."</p>
