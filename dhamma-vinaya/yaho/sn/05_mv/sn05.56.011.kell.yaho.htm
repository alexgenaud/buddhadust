					<p class="f4">On one occasion, the Blessed one was staying at Benares in the Deer Sanctuary at Isipatana.<br />
					There the Blessed One addressed the monks of the group of five thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these two extremes are not to be practiced by one who has gone forth. What are the two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this, devotion to a life of luxury among sensual pleasures, which is low, vulgar, common, ignoble, and disadvantageous; and just this, devotion to self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and disadvantageous.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, not approaching either of these extremes, the middle way, perfectly realized by the Tathāgata, produces insight, produces knowledge, and leads to calmness, higher knowledge, enlightenment, and Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is this middle way, perfectly realized by the Tathāgata, which produces insight, produces knowledge, and leads to calmness, higher knowledge, enlightenment, and Nirvana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this noble eightfold path, that is &ndash; right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the middle way, perfectly realized by the Tathāgata, which produces insight, produces knowledge, and leads to calmness, higher knowledge, enlightenment, and Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering:<br />
					birth is suffering,<br />
					old age is suffering,<br />
					sickness is suffering,<br />
					death is suffering,<br />
					association with the unpleasant is suffering,<br />
					dissociation from the pleasant is suffering,<br />
					not getting what one wants is suffering;<br />
					in short, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering:<br />
					this very craving leading to rebirth,<br />
					connected with passionate delight,<br />
					finding pleasure here and there,<br />
					namely:<br />
					craving for sensual pleasures,<br />
					craving for existence,<br />
					and craving for non-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering:<br />
					the complete fading away and cessation<br />
					of this very craving,<br />
					the giving up and forsaking of it,<br />
					freedom from it,<br />
					and non-attachment to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering:<br />
					it is this noble eightfold path,<br />
					that is &ndash; right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the noble truth of suffering':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of suffering ought to be fully understood':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of suffering has been fully understood':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of the origin of suffering ought to be abandoned': thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of the origin of suffering has been abandoned':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of the cessation of suffering ought to be realized': thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering':<br />
					thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering ought to be developed': thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now this noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed': thus, monks, in regard to teachings not heard by me before, insight, knowledge, wisdom, revelation, and illumination arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long as, monks, my knowledge and vision just as it is of these four noble truths was not well-purified, in three rounds and twelve ways thus, then, monks, I did not claim, in this world with its devas, Mara, and Brahma, in this generation with its recluses and Brahmins, devas and humans:<br />
					"I have completely realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment".</p>

					<p class="f4">And since, monks, my knowledge and vision just as it is of these four noble truths was indeed well-purified, in three rounds and twelve ways thus, then, monks, I did claim, in this world with its devas, Mara, and Brahma, in this generation with its recluses and Brahmins, devas and humans:<br />
					"I have completely realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment".</p>

					<p class="f4">The knowledge and vision then arose in me &ndash;<br />
					'Unshakable is liberation in me, this is my last birth, now there is no more existence again'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus said the Blessed One.<br />
					Delighted, the monks of the group of five rejoiced in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when this explication was being spoken, there arose in the venerable Kondañña the vision of the Dhamma, free from defilement or stain &ndash;<br />
					"Whatever is subject to arising,<br />
					all that is subject to cessation".</p>

					<p class="f4">And then on the setting in motion of the Wheel of the Dhamma by the Blessed One, the terrestrial devas raised a shout &ndash;<br />
					"The unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One,<br />
					at Baranasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<br />
					and this cannot be turned back by any recluse or Brahmin or deva or Mara or Brahma or by anyone in the world".</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard the shout of the terrestrial devas, the Four Great Kings raised a shout &ndash;<br />
					"The unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One,<br />
					at Baranasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<br />
					and this cannot be turned back by any recluse or Brahmin or deva or Mara or Brahma or by anyone in the world".</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard the shout of the Four Great Kings,<br />
					the Tavatimsa devas . . .  etc . . . <br />
					the Yama devas . . .  etc . . . <br />
					the Tusita devas . . .  etc . . . <br />
					the Nimmanarati devas . . .  etc . . . <br />
					the Paranimmitavasavatti devas . . .  etc . . . <br />
					the devas of Brahma's body raised a shout &ndash;<br />
					"The unsurpassed Wheel of Dhamma has been set in motion by the Blessed One,<br />
					at Baranasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<br />
					and this cannot be turned back by any recluse or Brahmin or deva or Mara or Brahma or by anyone in the world".</p>

					<p class="f4">At that moment,<br />
					at that instant,<br />
					at that second,<br />
					the shout arose in the Brahma world.<br />
					And this ten thousandfold world trembled, quaked, and shook violently.<br />
					And an unlimited noble radiance appeared in the world surpassing the divine majesty of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One uttered a paean of joy &ndash;<br />
					"Kondañña indeed has understood! Kondañña indeed has understood! In this way "Kondañña-who-has-understood" became the name of the venerable Kondañña.</p>
