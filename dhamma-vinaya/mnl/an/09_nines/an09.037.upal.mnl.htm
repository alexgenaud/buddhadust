<meta name="description" content="Sister Upalavanna's translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya, Nines, Sutta 37. Another in a growing collection of suttas which describes an impersonal consciousness. Not 'Bodhi Mind'! Not something that is always there and simply needs to be realized, not something which when attained is the same as that which was left behind, but a stable, happy, fear-free mind-made freedom-sustained serenity where eye is such that of the realm of shapes there is no resultant personal experience." />

					<p class="f4">At one time venerable Ānanda was abiding in Ghosita's monastery in Kosambī. Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus from there:</p>

					<p class="f4">Friends, it is wonderful and surprising that The Blessed One who knows and sees, is worthy and rightfully enlightened does not leave any obstructions, for the purity and enlightenment of sentient beings, for overcoming grief and lament for realizing extinction for overcoming unpleasantness and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">-The eye will be such, that there will be no feelings for forms seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear will be such, that there will be no feelings for sounds heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose will be such, that there will be no feelings for smells scented.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue will be such, that there will be no feelings for tastes tasted.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body will be such that there will be no feelings for bodily contacts.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said venerable Udayi said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, Ānanda, is it when perceptive in that mental sphere that feelings are not present or when not perceptive in that mental sphere?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, its when perceptive in the respective mental sphere not when not perceptive in the respective mental sphere.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, not perceptive of what, in the respective mental sphere are there no feelings?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless abides in the sphere of space. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of space, with consciouness is boundless abides in the sphere of consciousness. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of consciousness, with there is nothing abides in the sphere of no-thingness. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, at one time I was abiding in the deer park in the Anjana forest in Saketa. Then a bhikkhuni of the knotted hair sect approached me, worshipped and standing on a side said: Venerable sir, ânanda, that concentration which is not strained, nor turned aside, not with determinations that act as self denials, when abiding in it, is for release and pleasantness and is without remorse; for what fruit is that concentration, as told by The Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, I replied to the bhikkhuni of the knotted hair sect thus 'Sister, that concentration which is not strained, nor turned aside, not with determinations that act as self denials, when abiding in it, is for release and pleasantness and is without remorse; as told by The Blessed One is for the fruits of worthiness. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</p>
