At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain bhikkhu approached The Blessed One, ... re ... sat on a side and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, it is said, is endowed with supportive conditions. How far is a bhikkhu endowed with supportive conditions?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu, the bhikkhu supported by faith too, dispels demerit and develops merit, by that his demerit gets dispelled. Bhikkhu, the bhikkhu supported by shame too, ... re ... remorse too, ... re ... effort too, ... re ... wisdom too, he thoroughly dispels demerit as he dispels seeing with the noble one's wisdom and dispels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu, the bhikkhu established in these five things should abide supported on four things. What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhu, the bhikkhu discriminating pursues a certain thing, discriminating patiently bears a certain thing, discriminating avoids a certain thing and discriminating drives out a certain thing. Bhikkhu, thus the bhikkhu is endowed with the supportive conditions.</p>
