					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/09_nines/an09.004.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/09_nines/an09.004.hare.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> I heard thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time venerable Nandaka was in the attendance hall advising, inciting and making the hearts light of the bhikkhus, with a talk. The Blessed One having got up from his seclusion in the evening, approached the attendance hall and stood waiting outside, until the talk ended. The Blessed One knowing that the talk ended, clearing his throat, knocked on the door. The bhikkhus opened the door to The Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One entered the attendance hall, sat on the prepared seat and addressed venerable Nandaka: Nandaka your disposition was a long address to the bhikkhus. My back ached standing outside until the end of the disposition."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said venerable Nandaka in an antaganized tone said: Venerable sir, we did not know that The Blessed One was standing outside. If we knew that The Blessed One was standing outside, we would not have said so much."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One knowing that venerable Nandaka was antagonized said: Nandaka, it is good! Sons of clansmen like you who have left home and have become homeless, should sit with a righteous talk, as you have done. Nandaka, for those who have come together, there are two things to do. Either a talk on righteousness or observe noble silence. Nandaka the bhikkhu has faith and not virtues. By that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith and virtues. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith and virtues, he becomes complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith and virtues, not gained internal appeasement, by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith, virtues and internal appeasement. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues and internal appeasement by that he becomes complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues, gained internal appeasement and not gained higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith, virtues. internal appeasement and gain higher widom to penetrate the Teaching. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues internal appeasement and gain higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he become complete. Nandaka, just as to a four-footed when one foot is lame, by that factor he becomes incomplete. In the same manner when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues, gained internal appeasement and not gained higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith, virtues. internal appeasement and gain higher widom to penetrate the Teaching. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues internal appeasement and gain higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that he becomes complete."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saying this got up and went into his dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after The Blessed One had gone venerable Nandaka addressed the bhikkhus: Here, friends, The Blessed One with four lines declared the complete and pure holy life -Nandaka the bhikkhu has faith and not virtues. By that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith and virtues. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith and virtues, he becomes complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith and virtues, not gained internal appeasement, by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith, virtues and internal appeasement. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues and internal appeasement by that he becomes complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues, gained internal appeasement and not gained higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith, virtues. internal appeasement and gain higher widom to penetrate the Teaching. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues internal appeasement and gain higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he becomes complete. Nandaka, just as to a four-footed when one foot is lame, by that factor he becomes incomplete.

					<p class="f4">Friends, these five are the benefits for listening and discussing the Teaching at the right time. What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, friends, the bhikkhu preaches the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters declaring the complete and pure holy life When the bhikkhu preaches, in this and other manner the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters, declaring the complete and pure holy life, he becomes loveable agreeable esteemed and developed to the Teacher. Friends this is the first benefit for listening to the Teaching and discussing it at the right time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, friends, the bhikkhu preaches the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters declaring the complete and pure holy life When the bhikkhu preaches in this and other manner the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end full of meanings even in the letters, declaring the complete and pure holy life, he experiences the meanings and the Teaching. Friends this is the second benefit for listening to the Teaching and discussing it at the right time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, friends, the bhikkhu preaches the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters declaring the complete and pure holy life When the bhikkhu preaches in this and other manner the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end full of meanings even in the letters, declaring the complete and pure holy life, to the co-associates in the holy life, the trainee bhikkhus who abide with the aim of attaining the end of unpleasantness arouse effort to attain the not yet attained, to realize the not yet realized. Those bhikkhus who are worthy, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, thrown off the load, has come to the highest good, destroyed the bond `to be' and rightfully knowing are released, hearing that Teaching abide in pleasantness here and now. Friends this is the fifth benefit for listening to the Teaching and discussing it at the right time.</p>
