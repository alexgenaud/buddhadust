					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, at one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijjha peaks in Rajagaha and I heard this in the presence of The Blessed One and it was accepted by The Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sutava, it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, has put the load down, have come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond 'to be', is released rightfully knowing, to go beyond five things —</p>

					to partake sensual things accumulating them as they have done in a household.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, does The Blessed One recall it and remember it completely?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Sutava, I recall it and remember it completely, not only earlier, even now I tell, Sutava,<br />
					it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy,<br />
					destroyed desires,<br />
					lived the holy life,<br />
					done what should be done,<br />
					has put the load down,<br />
