At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijjha peaks in Rājagaha. Then the wandering ascetic Sajjha approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, at one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijjha peaks in Rājagaha and I heard this in the presence of The Blessed One and it was accepted by The Blessed One: `Sajjha, it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, has put the load down, have come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond `to be', is released rightfully knowing, to go beyond five things- It is not possible for the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires, to destroy living things knowing, to take the not given with a thievish mind, to enjoy sexual intercourse, to say lies knowingly, to partake sensual things accumulating them as they have done in a household.' Venerable sir, does The Blessed One recall it and remember it completely?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Sajjha, I recall it and remember it completely, not only earlier, even now I tell it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, has put the load down, have come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond `to be', is released rightfully knowing, to go beyond nine things- It is not possible for the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires, to destroy living things knowing, to take the not given with a thievish mind, to enjoy sexual intercourse, to say lies knowingly, to partake sensual things accumulating them as they have done in a household, to reject enlightenment, to reject the Teaching, to reject the Community of bhikkhus and to give up the holy life. Sajjha, earlier and now also I tell, it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, has put the load down, have come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond `to be', is released rightfully knowing, to go beyond these nine things.</p>
