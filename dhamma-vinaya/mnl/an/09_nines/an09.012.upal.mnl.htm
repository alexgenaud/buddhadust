					<p class="f4">At that time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove, in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta, putting on robes in the morning, and taking bowl and robes, entered Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is too early to go the alms round in Sāvatthi, what if I go to the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects. I will approach it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then venerable Sāriputta approached the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects, exchanged friendly greetings with them and sat on side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the wandering ascetics of other sects, who had assembled and were seated, this talk had arisen —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, if someone dies with substratum remaining,<br />
					he is not released in every way.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not released from hell,<br />
					from the animal world,<br />
					from the sphere of ghosts<br />
					and from loss and evil states."</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta, neither accepting nor rejecting those words,<br />
					got up from the seat thinking I will know the meaning of those words in the presence of The Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta going the alms round in Sāvatthi,<br />
					after the meal was over<br />
					and returning from the alms round,<br />
					approached The Blessed One, worshipped,<br />
					sat on a side and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, venerable sir, I put on robes in the morning,<br />
					and taking bowl and robes,<br />
					entered Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me:<br />
					'It is too early to go the alms round in Sāvatthi,<br />
					what if I go to the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects.<br />
					I will approach it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I approached the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects,<br />
					exchanged friendly greetings with them and sat on side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the wandering ascetics of other sects,<br />
					who had assembled and were seated,<br />
					this talk had arisen —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, if someone dies with substratum remaining,<br />
					he is not released in every way.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not released from hell,<br />
					from the animal world,<br />
					from the sphere of ghosts<br />
					and from loss and evil states."</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, I neither accepted nor rejected those words,<br />
					got up from my seat thinking I will know the meaning of these words in the presence of The Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, who are these not learned,<br />
					foolish wandering ascetics,<br />
					how could they know the state with substratum,<br />
					or the one with substratum,<br />
					the state without substratum,<br />
					or the one without substratum?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, these nine persons die with substratum,<br />
					released from hell,<br />
					from animal birth,<br />
					from the sphere of ghosts<br />
					and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Sāriputta, a certain person is complete in virtues, complete in concentration and incomplelte in wisdom. Destroying the five lower bonds binding him to the sensual world, he stations himself immediately next to extinction. Sāriputta, this is the first persons who dies with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, a certain person is complete in virtues, complete in concentration and incomplelte in wisdom. Destroying the five lower bonds binding him to the sensual world, he stations himself in the vicinity of extinction ... re ... he extinguishes without substratum, ... re ... he extinguishes with substratum, ... re ... he goes up stream to the highest Brahma world. Sāriputta, this is the fifth person who dies with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, a certain person is complete in virtues, incomplete in concentration and incomplete in wisdom. Destroying three bonds and dwindling his greed, hate and delusion he becomes a once returner. He comes to this world once more to make an end of unpleasantness. Sāriputta, this is the sixth person who dies with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, a certain person is complete in virtues, incomplete in concentration and incomplete in wisdom. Destroying the three bonds he has one more birth as a human to make an end of unpleasantness. Sāriputta, this is the seventh person who dies with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, a certain person is complete in virtues, incomplete in concentration and incomplete in wisdom. Destroying three bonds he transmigrates from clan to clan and being born twice or thrice makes an end of unpleasantness. Sāriputta, this is the eighth person who dies with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, a certain person is complete in virtues, incomplete in concentration and incomplete in wisdom. Destroying three bonds he transmigrates as a human or god the most seven times and makes end of unpleasantness. Sāriputta, this is the eighth person who dies with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, who are these not learned, foolish wandering ascetics, how could they know the state with substratum, or the one with substratum, the state without substratum, or the one without substratum.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, these nine persons die with substratum, released, from hell, from animal birth, from the sphere of ghosts and released from loss and hellish births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, this discourse should not be taught to bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay male disciples and female disciples until such time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">May they be not negligent hearing this discourse. Yet I teach it to those who are wise.</p>
