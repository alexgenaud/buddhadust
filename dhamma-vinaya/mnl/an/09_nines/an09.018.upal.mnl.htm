					<p class="f4">At that time The Blessed One was abiding in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, the full moon observance endowed with nine factors if observed is very fruitful, beneficial, sacrificial and has a great spread out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the full moon observance endowed with nine factors, observed in which manner is very fruitful, beneficial, sacrificial and has a great spread out?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As long as life lasts the noble ones have given up destroying living things, become ashamed throwing away stick and weapon abide arousing compassion for all living things.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too this night and day will give up destroying living things, become ashamed will throw away stick and weapon and will abide arousing compassion for all living things.</p>

					<p class="f4">By this factor I imitate the worthy state and my full moon observance gets completed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, endowed with this first factor the full moon observance is very fruitful, beneficial, sacrificial and has a great spread out.</p>

					<p><i>[Omitted: taking what is not given; living the chast life; abstaining from lying; drinking strong drink; eating one meal; looking at shows]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">As long as life lasts the noble ones have given up high and stately beds and seats.</p>

					<p class="f4">They take a low seat and a spread of grass for the bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too this night and day will give up high and stately beds and seats.</p>

					<p class="f4">Will take a low seat and a spread of grass for the bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">By this factor I imitate the worthy state and my full moon observance gets completed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, abide with a mind of loving kindness pervading one direction, the second, the third, the fourth, above, below and across everywhere, for all purposes, entirely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide with the thought of lovingkindness for the whole world, grown great and immeasurable, without anger or ill will Be endowed with this ninth factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the full moon observance endowed with these nine factors if observed is very fruitful, beneficial, sacrificial and has a great spread out.</p>
