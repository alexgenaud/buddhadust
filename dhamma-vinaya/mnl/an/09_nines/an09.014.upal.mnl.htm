					<p class="f4">Then venerable Samiddhi approached venerable Sàriputta, worshipped, sat on side, and when seated, venerable Sàriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, with what sign, do thoughts and discursive thoughts arise to a man?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, with the sign, name and matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, on account of what do they become various.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, in the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, from what do they arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, they arise from contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, in what do they come together?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, they come together in feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, what is foremost for them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, concentration is foremost for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, what is supreme in them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, mindfulness is supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, what is superior in them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, wisdom is superior in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, what is the essence there?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, the essence is release.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, where is the dive?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, in deathlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Samiddhi, when asked, with what sign do thoughts and discursive arise to man, you said, with the sign name and matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked how do they become various, you said through the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked how do they arise, you said, it was through contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked how do they get together, you said it was through feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked what was foremost for them, you said, concentration was foremost for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked what was supreme there, you said, mindfulness was supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked what was superior in them, you said wisdom was superior.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked what is the essence there, you said release is the essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked in what is the dive, you said, it was in deathlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good! Samiddhi, you answered whatever questions asked, do not think about it.</p>
