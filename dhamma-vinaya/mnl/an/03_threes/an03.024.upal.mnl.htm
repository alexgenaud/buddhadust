					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons have done much to a person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the person gone to whom this person takes refuge in the Enlightenment, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the person gone to whom this person knows as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, bhikkhus, the person gone to whom, this person destroys desires, releases the mind and released through wisdom, here and now abides having realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons have done much to this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, it is not possible that these three persons could be thoroughly repaid with gratitude, by this person revering him, attending on him, clasping hands towards him and honouring him with robes, morsel food, dwellings and medicinal requisites.</p>
