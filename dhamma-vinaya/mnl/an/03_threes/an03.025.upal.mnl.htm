					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The person whose mind is comparable to a sore, the person whose mind is comparable to lightning and the person whose mind is comparable to a diamond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to a sore?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person is angry and has grudges.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a few words are told he becomes angry, swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure, like a festered sore touched by a clod or stone would ooze much pus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in like manner a person with a mind comparable to a sore is angry, has grudges and when a few words are told he becomes angry, swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to lightning?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person knows, as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is its cessation and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man would see forms in pitch darkness when there is lightning.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same manner a certain person knows as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to a diamond?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person having destroyed desires, the mind released and released through wisdom abides here and now by himself realizing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, just as there is nothing that a diamond would not cut, a gem or a stone.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same manner a certain person having destroyed desires, the mind released and released through wisdom, abides here and now by himself realizing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world.</p>
