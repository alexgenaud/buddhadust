<meta name="description" content="Sister Upalavana's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 22. Providing medical treatment to three types of persons is likened to teaching Dhamma to three types of persons. One sort of person will not recover whether he receives treatment or not; one will recover whether he receives treatment or not; and one will recover if he receives treatment, but not if he does not. Similarly one sort of person will not gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; one will gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; and one will gain the path if he hears Dhamma and not if he does not. It is for the sake of the sick man who will recover if he receives medical treatment that providing medical treatment for the sick is not useless. Similarly it is for the sake of the one who will gain the path if he hears Dhamma that teaching Dhamma is not useless." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three sick persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain sick person, whether he gains or does not gain suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant, he does not recover from that illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second sick person, whether he gains or does not gain suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant, he recovers from that illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The third sick person gains not that he does not gain, suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant and he recovers from that illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, on account of this sick person, who gains not that he does not gain, suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant and recovers from that illness, I grant the supplication of suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant for the sick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, on account of this sick person other sick persons should be attended to.</p>

					<p class="f4">These three sick persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in the same manner there are three persons in the world comparable to these three sick persons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person whether he gains sight of the Thus Gone One or does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, whether he hears the Teaching and Discipline of the Thus Gone One or does not hear it, he does not enter the right path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the second person whether he gains sight of the Thus Gone One or does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, whether he hears the Teaching and Discipline of the Thus Gone One or does not hear it, he enters the right path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the third person gains sight of the Thus Gone One, not that he does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hears the Teaching and Discipline of the Thus Gone One, not that he does not hear it, and enters the right path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, it is on account of this person, who gains sight of the Thus Gone One, not that he does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, hears the Teaching and Discipline of the Thus Gone One, not that he does not hear it, and enters the right path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts, that I grant the Teaching should be given.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus on account of this person, others also should be taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">These three persons are evident in the world.</p>
