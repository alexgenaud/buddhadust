					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with three things follows the sure method from the beginning with aroused effort, for the destruction of desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu is controlled in his mental faculties, knows the right amount to partake and is wakeful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu controlled in his mental faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu seeing a form does not take the sign or the details as someone abiding with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled may arise thoughts of greed and displeasure, so he controls the mental faculty of the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound,...re...</p>

					<p class="f4">Smelling a scent,...re..</p>

					<p class="f4">Tasting food,..re.....</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing a touch ...re....</p>

					<p class="f4">Cognising an idea does not take the sign or the details.</p>

					<p class="f4">To someone abiding with the mental faculty of the mind uncontrolled may arise thoughts of greed and displeasure, so he controls the mental faculty of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the bhikkhu is controlled in his mental faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the bhikkhu know the right amount to partake?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu wisely considering partakes food, not for, fun, intoxication or to look beautiful.</p>

					<p class="f4">He partakes food thinking</p>

					<p class="f4">I partake this, for maintaining the body without attachment to tastes, as a help to lead the holy life Partaking this food I get rid of earlier feelings, do not arouse new feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It should be faultless, and for a pleasant abiding.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this manner the bhikkhu knows the right amount to partake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu wakeful?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu cleans the mind of obstructing things during the day time, seated some where.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the first watch of the night too he cleans the mind of obstructing things.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night he lies down turning to his right side, taking the posture in which the lion sleeps.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting one foot over the other he becomes aware of the perception of waking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting up in the last watch of the night he cleans the mind of obstructing things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the bhikkhu becomes wakeful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these three things from the beginning with aroused effort, follows the sure method for the destruction of desires.</p>
