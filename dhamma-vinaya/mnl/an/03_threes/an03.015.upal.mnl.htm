					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park in Isipatana in Benares and addressed the bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in the past, there was a king by the name Pacetana.</p>

					<p class="f4">One day he called the chariot maker and asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, chariot maker, in another six months, there will be a battle, could you make a pair of new wheels?</p>

					<p class="f4">The chariot maker replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">Possible my'lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The chariot maker made one wheel, six days before the completion of the six months.</p>

					<p class="f4">The king addressed the chariot maker again and told him, Friend, chariot maker in another six days, there will be a battle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are the pair of wheels made?</p>

					<p class="f4">My lord, six days before the completion of the six months, I have made one wheel.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, chariot maker, is it possible to make the other wheel in the remaining six days?</p>

					<p class="f4">Possible. Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the chariot maker completed the other wheel in the remaining six days and approached king Pacetana and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My lord, here are the new pair of wheels.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend chariot maker, what is the difference in the wheel you made, in six months short of six days and the wheel you made in six days, I see no difference in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">My lord, there is a difference, now you will see the difference.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the chariot maker taking the wheel done in six days, set it rolling.</p>

					<p class="f4">It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, circled and fell on the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he rolled the wheel made in six months short of six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, and stood as though saying the work is done.</p>

					<p class="f4">My lord, of the wheel made in six days, the outer circumference, the spokes, and the nave are crooked, faulty and with blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, then circled and fell on the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">My lord, of the wheel made in six months short of six days, the outer circumference, the spokes, and the nave are not crooked, not faulty and without blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed and then stood upright as though to say the work is done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, did it occur to you, that the chariot maker was someone else.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, it should be known that I was that chariot maker at that time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I was clever in the crookedness, faults and blemishes of wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I'm worthy, rightfully enlightened and clever in bodily crookednesses, faults and blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am clever in verbal crookednesses, faults and blemishes and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, who has not dispelled bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes in this dispensation, will have a fall like the wheel done in six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, who has dispelled bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes, will stand firm in this dispensation like the wheel done in six months less by six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, your training should be, we will dispel bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes.</p>
