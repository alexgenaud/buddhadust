					<p class="f4">All troubles come from the foolish not the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">All annoyances come from the foolish not the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">A house of reeds or of grass catching fire would burn the ridge poles, the flames running up and down would touch the bolts and closed windows and would burn them all.</p>
