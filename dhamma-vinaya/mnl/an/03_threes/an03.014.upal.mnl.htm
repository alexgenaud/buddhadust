					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the righteous universal monarch, he too manages the wheel without a king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, how is the righteous universal monarch the ruler of righteousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhu, the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching and makes arrangements to protect himself together with the populace.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Again, bhikkhu the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching makes arrangements to protect all warriors, all brahmins, all the populace in the suburbs, all recluses and all animals.</p>

					<p class="f4">O! bhikkhu the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching, makes arrangements to protect himself, all the, populace, warriors, brahmins, people in the suburbs, recluses and animals.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this manner he rolls the wheel not to be stopped by the hand of any opposing human.</p>

					<p class="f4">O! Bhikkhu, in the same manner, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened and righteous, values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching, arranging the protection of bodily activity thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This kind of bodily activity should be practised and this kind of bodily activity should not be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, bhikkhu the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened and righteous, values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching, arranging the protection of verbal activity thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This kind of verbal activity should be practised and this kind of verbal activity should not be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, bhikkhu the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened, and righteous, values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching, arranging the protection of mental activity thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This kind of mental activity should be practised and this kind of mental activity should not be practised.</p>

					<p class="f4">O! bhikkhu the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened and righteous, values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching by the protections through bodily, verbal and mental activity and he rolls the wheel of the Teaching not to be stopped by a recluse, a brahmin, a god, Māra, Brahmā, or anyone in the world.</p>
