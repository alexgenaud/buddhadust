					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, there is a person that should not be associated, there is one that should be associated and there is another that should be honoured and revered and associated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person that should not be associated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person is below par in virtues, concentration and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such should not be associated unless out of sympathy and compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person that should be associated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person is par in virtues, concentration and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such should be associated.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those par in virtues converse on virtues, those par in concentration converse on concentration and those par in wisdom converse on wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For them it becomes a pleasant abiding, therefore they should be associated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person that should be honoured, revered and associated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person is much above in virtues, concentration and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such should be honoured, revered and associated. What is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will complete virtues not yet completed, will be satisfied seeing my completed virtues, then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will complete my wisdom not yet completed and I will wisely see whether it is complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, bhikkhus, such persons should be honoured, revered and associated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Associating someone low is deterioration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Associating an equal there's no deterioration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore bend down to a superior.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is quick growth.</p>
