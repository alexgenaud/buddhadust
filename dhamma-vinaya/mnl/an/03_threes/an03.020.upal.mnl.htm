					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, endowed with three things the shopkeeper very soon comes to abundance and great wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the shopkeeper becomes wise, sharp and resourceful.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the shopkeeper become wise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the shopkeeper knows the articles to trade.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks this article if bought and sold, this much will be the money and the income will be this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the shopkeeper becomes wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the shopkeeper become sharp?</p>

					<p class="f4">The shopkeeper becomes clever in buying and selling articles of trade.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the shopkeeper becomes sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, how does the shopkeeper become resourceful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the householders and the sons of householders who are rich and have much wealth know that the shopkeeper is wise and sharp, he has resources to look after his wife and children.</p>

					<p class="f4">We too should give him presents from time to time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the shopkeeper becomes resourceful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, endowed with these three things the shopkeeper very soon comes to abundance and great wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in the same manner the bhikkhu endowed with three things very soon comes to abundance and development in meritorious thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu becomes wise, sharp and resourceful.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the bhikkhu become wise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu knows, as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, thus the bhikkhu is wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the bhikkhu become sharp?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort to dispel demeritorious thoughts and becomes firm with aroused effort to develop meritorious thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the bhikkhu becomes sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become resourceful?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the bhikkhu from time to time approaches the learned bhikkhus, the bearers of the Teaching and the Discipline, those who know the headings and asks them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sirs, what is the meaning of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those venerable ones explain to him and disclose the hidden meanings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he dispels his various doubts in the Teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the bhikkhu becomes resourceful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in this manner, the bhikkhu very soon comes to abundance and development in meritorious thoughts.</p>
