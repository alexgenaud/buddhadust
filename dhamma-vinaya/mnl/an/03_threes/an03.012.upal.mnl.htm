					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the head anointed warrior king recalls these three with pleasure as long as he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The first is the place where the head anointed warrior king was born, the second is the place where he was head anointed as the warrior king, the third is the place where he fought a battle and became victorious.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the head anointed warrior king recalls these three with pleasure as long as he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in the same manner these three are recalled by the bhikkhu as long as he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The first is the place where the bhikkhu cut his hair, wore yellow robes and became homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second is the place where the bhikkhu understood, as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the ceasing of unpleasantness and this is the path for the cessation of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The third is the place where the bhikkhu destroyed desires, released his mind, and released through wisdom, in this very life having realized abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these are the three places that a bhikkhu recalls with pleasure as long as he lives.</p>
