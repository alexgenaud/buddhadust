					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, there are three kinds of persons in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one who has no desires to attain it, the one who hopes to attain it, and the one who has fulfilled his desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, which person has no desires to attain it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he hears, a certain person of warrior clan is made the head anointed warrior king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing this it does not occur to him -</p>

					<p class="f4">O! when will I be the head anointed warrior king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is the person who has no desires for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, who is the person who hopes to attain it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the eldest son of the head anointed warrior king, who is not anointed and has come of age hears a certain person of warrior clan is made the head anointed warrior king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing this it occurs to him -</p>

					<p class="f4">O! when will I be the head anointed warrior king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is the person who has fulfilled his desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world and in the same manner three persons are evident among the bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one who has no desires to attain it, the one who hopes to attain it, and the one who has fulfilled his desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, a certain person is unvirtuous, with very low thoughts, secret activity and evil conduct, having promised to lead the holy life, he abides doing the evil activities born to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">The bhikkhu of this name having destroyed desires, released his mind from desires, released through wisdom, abides here and now having realized it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">O! When shall I destroy desires, attain the release of mind, the release through wisdom by myself realizing, abide here and now?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this person has no desires to attain it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, which person has desires to attain it? Bhikkhus, a certain person is virtuous, with good conduct, and leads the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears:</p>

					<p class="f4">The bhikkhu of this name having destroyed desires, released his mind from desires, released through wisdom, abides here and now having realized it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world.</p>
