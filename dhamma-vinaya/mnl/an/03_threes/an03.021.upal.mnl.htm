					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then venerable Saviṭṭha and venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita approached venerable Sāriputta, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then venerable Sāriputta said to venerable Saviṭṭha: Friend, Saviṭṭha, three kinds of persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The body witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these three persons which person is excellent and more pleasing to you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, Sāriputta, of these three, such as the body witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith, that one released through faith is more pleasing to me as his faculty of faith is much developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then venerable Sāriputta said to venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, Koṭṭhita, three kinds of persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The body witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these three persons which person is more pleasing to you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, Sāriputta, of these three, such as the body witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith, the body witness is more pleasing to me as his faculty of concentration is much developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita said to venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, Sāriputta, three kinds of persons are evident in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The body witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these three persons which person is more pleasing to you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, Mahā Koṭṭhita, of these three, such as the body witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith, the one come to righteousness of view is more pleasing to me as his faculty of wisdom is much developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then venerable Sāriputta said thus to venerable Saviṭṭha and venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">Friends, we have each declared this according to our individual understandings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now let us approach the Blessed One and ask, as to which is the excellent and most pleasing.

					Venerable Sāriputta, venerable Saviṭṭha and venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side and venerable Sāriputta related all the conversation that took place between himself, venerable Saviṭṭha and venerable Mahā Koṭṭhita.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three persons, which one is more pleasing and excellent. It can be stated that when the one released through faith has come to the path of worthiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body witness and the one come righteousness of view are either to return to this world or not return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three persons, which one is more pleasing and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It can be stated that when the body witness has come to the path of worthiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one released through faith and the one come to righteousness of view are either to return to this world once or not return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three persons, which one is more pleasing and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It can be stated that when the one come to righteousness of view, has come to the path of worthiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body witness and the one released through faith are either to return to this world once or not return.</p>
