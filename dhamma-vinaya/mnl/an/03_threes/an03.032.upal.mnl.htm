<meta name="description" content="Sister Upalavana's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 32. Ānanda asks the Buddha whether or not there is a state of samadhi in which there is no I-making or My-Making and yet there is liberation of the heart by wisdom. The Buddha replies that this state is attained thinking: 'This is sanity, this is the pinnacle, that is, the calming of all own-making, the forsaking of upkeep, the destruction of thirst, dispassion, ending, Nibbana." />

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, is there a kind of concentration<br />
					in which there does not arise<br />
					latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me'<br />
					in this sixfold conscious body,<br />
					and externally on account of any signs,<br />

					and in which one abides<br />
					without the latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, there is such a concentration<br />
					in which there does not arise<br />
					latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me'<br />
					in this sixfold conscious body,<br />
					and externally on account of any signs,<br />
					in which concentration one abides,<br />
					the mind released<br />
					and released through wisdom,<br />
					without the latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me'<br />
					and one could abide in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, how is that concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, here, it occurs to the bhikkhu:<br />
					This is peaceful,<br />
					this is exalted,<br />
					such as the appeasement of all determinations,<br />
					giving up of all substratum,<br />
					destruction of craving,<br />
					non attachment,<br />
					cessation and extinction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, in this manner<br />
					there is to the bhikkhu a concentration<br />
					in which there does not arise<br />
					latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me'<br />
					in this sixfold conscious body,<br />
					and externally on account of any signs.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this concentration,<br />
					the mind is released<br />
					and released through wisdom,
					one abides without the latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me'<br />
					and in which one could abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, it was on account of this,<br />
					that I had answered thus to Punnaka in the Parayanavagga:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Destroying everything high and low, if he does not tremble,<br />
							Is appeased, emancipated, without confusion and desires,<br />
							I say, he has crossed birth and decay.</p>

					worshipped and sat on a side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said to venerable Sāiputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāiputta, I preach in short and in detail,<br />
					I preach in short and detail too,<br />
					those who understand it are rare.</p>

					<p class="f4">O! Blessed One,<br />
					O! Well gone One,<br />
					this is the time to preach in short and in detail,<br />
					the time to preach in short and detail too,<br />
					there are those who understand it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore Sāiputta, you should train thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">In this sixfold conscious body,<br />
					and externally on account of any signs,<br />
					there will not be the latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the abiding in which the mind is released<br />
					and the abiding,<br />
					'release through wisdom'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāiputta, to one abiding in this<br />
					there are no latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abide in that release of mind<br />
					and release through wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāiputta, you should train in this manner.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāiputta, in this sixfold conscious body<br />
					and externally on account of any signs,<br />
					when there are no latent tendencies of measuring as<br />
					'I be' and 'it is to me,'<br />
					that is the release of mind<br />
					and the release through wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāiputta, to this it is said<br />
					the bhikkhu has cut up craving<br />
					and removed the bonds,<br />
					rightfully penetrated measuring<br />
					and ended unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāiputta, it is on account of this<br />
					that I have answered to Udaya in this way:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Dispelling the interest for sensuality together with pleasure;<br />
							Pulling out sloth and putting an end to doubts,<br />
							And purifying mindfulness with equanimity preceded by logical thinking.<br />
							I declare the release which is knowing,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> by breaking up ignorance.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The release which is knowing. <i>'aññāvimokkhaɱ'</i>. This is one of the releases declared by the Blessed One. It amounts to complete control of the six doors of mental contact. Such a person does not change the least on account of data from any of the doors of mental contact. He enjoys a pleasantness that is rare here and now.</p>
