<meta name="description" content="The Sister Upalavana translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 55. Nakula's mother and father each approach the Buddha and each, in identical words, states that they are not aware of the other ever having transgressed against them either in thought or deed and then state that they are desirous of seeing each other in lives to come. The Buddha instructs them in how such a thing is to be attained." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park in the Besakala forest among the Sumsumara peaks in the Bhagga country.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached the home of the householder Nakulapita, and sat on the prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">The householder Nakulapita and his wife approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder Nakulapita said thus to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, from the day I brought Nakulamata in her childhood, even as a child, I do not know of her mind looking outside, and never desiring outside bodily contacts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, we desire to know each other here and now, so also here after.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder's wife, Nakulamata too said thus to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, from the day I was brought by Nakulapita in my childhood, even as a child I do not know of his mind looking outside, and never desiring outside bodily contacts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, we desire to know each other here and now, so also here after.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householders, if husband and wife wish to know each other here and now, both should be endowed with the same measure of faith, virtues, benevolence, and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they will know each other hereafter as well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both virtuous, generous, restrained and living righteously<br />
					They are the couple who speak to each other lovingly.<br />
					Results would be abundant, the living together will be meaningful.<br />
					Enemies, of the two with equal virtues, would be unhappy<br />
					The couple will lead a happy life here and now<br />
					And enjoy heavenly sensual bliss after death.</p>
