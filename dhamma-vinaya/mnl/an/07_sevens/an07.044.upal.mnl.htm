					<p class="f4">At that time the Brahmin with a lofty body was going to offer a great sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">So five hundred bulls, five hundred young bulls, five hundred young cows, five hundred goats, five hundred sheep, were brought to the sacrificial post to be sacrificed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brahmin with the lofty body approached The Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to The Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, I too have heard that, setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the second time the Brahmin with the lofty body said, ... re ... for the third time the Brahmin with the lofty body said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, I too have heard that, setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then good Gotama, our ideas agree, yours and mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said venerable ânanda said to the Brahmin with a lofty body-</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, that is not how you should question the Thus Gone One.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should do it thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too have a desire to set fire and raise the sacrificial post.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, advise me on this, so that it would be for my welfare and pleasantness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brahmin with a lofty body said to The Blessed One Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and good results.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too have a desire to set fire and raise the sacrificial post.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, advise me on this, so that it would be for my welfare and pleasantness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The bodily weapon, the verbal weapon and the mental weapon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, arouses the mind -</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of bulls for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of young bulls for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of cows for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of goats for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of sheep for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I do good, he does evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I do merit, he does demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, says such words -</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of bulls for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of young bulls for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of cows for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of goats for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill this amount of sheep for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I do good, he does evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I do merit, he does demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice himself makes endeavour -</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill the bulls for the sacrifice! Kill the young bulls for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill the cows for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill the goats for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Kill the sheep for the sacrifice!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I do good, he does evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I do merit, he does demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, these three fires should be dispelled, avoided, should not be followed after.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fire of lust, the fire of hatred and the fire of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, why should the fire of lust be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, with lust, overcome by lust one misbehaves by body, speech and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the fire of lust should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, why should the fire of hatred be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, with hatred, overcome by hatred one misbehaves by body, speech and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the fire of hatred should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, why should the fire of delusion be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, deluded and overcome by delusion one misbehaves by body, speech and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the fire of delusion should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, these three fires should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fire worthy of offerings, the household fire and the fire worthy of gifts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, what is the fire worthy of offerings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, mother or father is the fire worthy of offerings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, I am adored and produced from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore mother and father are the fire worthy of offerings; they should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, what is the fire of the household?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, sons, wife, slaves, messengers and workmen are the household fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the household fire should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, what is the fire worthy of gifts?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Brahmin, of those recluses and Brahmins who have given up false teachers, some train to be patient and gentle, a certain one tames himself, a certain one appeases himself, a certain one extinguishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, this is the fire worthy of gifts.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fire worthy of gifts should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmin, as for the fire of firewood, from time to time it should be lighted, attended to, put out and put aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said the Brahmin with the lofty body said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Remember me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I will release the five hundred bulls, the five hundred young bulls, the five hundred cows, the five hundred goats and the five hundred sheep I will bestow their lives, may they eat green grass, may they drink cool water, may they feel the cool air blowing.</p>
