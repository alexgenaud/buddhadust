					<p class="f4">At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these seven are the wealths.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wealths of faith,<br />
					virtues,<br />
					shame,<br />
					remorse,<br />
					learning,<br />
					benevolence<br />
					and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these seven are the wealths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is the wealth of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple takes faith in the enlightenment of the Thus Gone One:</p>

					<p class="f4">That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened.reñhe Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is a wealth of virtues?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple abstains from destroying living things ... re ... and taking intoxicating and brewed drinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of virtues.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is a wealth of shame?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple abides with shame, shameful of bodily misconduct verbal misconduct and mental misconduct is shameful of demeritorious things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of shame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is a wealth of remorse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple abides with remorse for bodily, verbal and mental misconduct and with remorse for demeritorious things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of remorse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is a wealth of learning?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple becomes learned, bearing and treasuring what he has learned of the Teaching that is good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, full of meaning in letters and words and completely stating the pure holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of that Teaching he becomes learned, practises it verbally and penetratingly sees it and straightens the view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of learning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is a wealth of benevolence?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple lives in a household with a mind free of the stains of miserliness, freely giving, with open hands, attached to giving and arranging to give to the needy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of benevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is a wealth of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple becomes wise of the rising and fading of the five holding masses, for the rightful penetration of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is a wealth of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these seven are the wealths.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The wealths faith, virtues, shame, remorse, learning, benevolence,<br />
							With wisdom as the seventh, if a woman or man has these wealths<br />
							He is not poor and his life is not useless<br />
							Therefore the wise develop faith, virtues and right view<br />
							Recalling the dispensation of the Enlightened One.</p>
