					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, I will teach the method of association and dissociation,<br />
					listen<br />
					and attend carefully.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, what is the method of association and dissociation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the woman with her internal femininity attends to her womanly charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arousing lust for it, she attends to an external masculinity with manly charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arousing lust for it she desires an external association.</p>

					<p class="f4">She desires some pleasantness and pleasure on account of that association.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, women attached to femininity and united to men do not go beyond femininity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the man with his internal masculinity attends to his manly charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations.</p>

					<p class="f4">He desires some pleasantness and pleasure on account of that association.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, men attached to masculinity and united to women do not go beyond masculinity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is association.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, how comes dissociation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the woman with her internal femininity does not attend to her womanly charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not arousing lust for it, she does not attend to an external masculinity with manly charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not arousing lust for it she does not desire an external association some pleasantness and pleasure on account of that association.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, women not attached to femininity and not united to men go beyond femininity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, men not attached to masculinity and not united to women go beyond masculinity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is dissociation.</p>
