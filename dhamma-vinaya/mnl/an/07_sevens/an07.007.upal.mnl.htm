					<p class="f4">At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ugga the chief minister approached The Blessed One, worshipped sat on a side and said to The Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising the wealth and resources amassed by Migara Rohana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ugga, how much are the wealth and resources of Migara Rohana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, the gold are in hundreds, in hundred thousands, there is nothing to speak of the rupees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ugga, there is wealth of this nature, I do not say, there is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ugga that wealth is not something peculiar to fire, water, kings, robbers and unwanted inheritors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ugga, there are these seven wealths, not available to fire, water, kings, robbers and unwanted inheritors.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The wealths of faith, virtues, shame, remorse, learnedness, benevolence and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ugga, these seven wealths are not available to fire, water, kings, robbers and unwanted inheritors.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The wealths faith, virtues, shame, remorse, learning, benevolence,<br />
							With wisdom as the seventh, if a woman or man has these wealths<br />
							He is not poor and his life is not useless<br />
							Therefore the wise develop faith, virtues and right view<br />
							Recalling the dispensation of the Enlightened One.</p>
