					of death,<br />
					loathing food,<br />
					non-attachment to all the world,<br />
					impermanence,<br />
					unpleasantness of impermanence and<br />
					lack of a self in unpleasantness.</p>

					put in the fire would draw back,<br />
					shrink and turn away,<br />
					would not stretch.</p>
