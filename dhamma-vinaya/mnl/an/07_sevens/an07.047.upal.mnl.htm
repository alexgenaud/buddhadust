					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, do you acknowledge leading a holy life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman, saying it correctly, The holy life should be lead pure and complete without a break, defects, spots and consistently.</p>

					<p class="f4">I live the holy life pure and complete, without a break, without defects, spots and consistently.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, what are the breaks, defects, spots and inconsistencies in the holy life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Brāhman, a certain recluse or Brāhman promising to live the holy life rightfully, does not enter into a secret association with a woman but enjoys rubbing, massaging, shampooing and other negligences.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys them, strives for them and prospers with them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman, these are interruptions, defects, spots and inconsistencies of the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman to this I say, leading an impure holy life enjoying sexuality not released from birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, unpleasantness displeasure and distress.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Brāhman a certain recluse or Brāhman promising to live the holy life rightfully, does not enter into a secret association with a woman. Does not enjoy rubbing, massaging, shampooing and other negligences. Yet jokes and jests, sports, amuses himself, ... re ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not joke, jest, sport or amuse himself with a woman. Yet eye to eye meets with a woman. ... re ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not recall laughing, talking, and sporting in the past. Yet sees a householder or the son of a householder endowed and attended by the five strands of sense pleasures ... re ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not see a householder or the son of a householder endowed and attended with the five strands of sense pleasures. Yet leads the holy life aspiring birth in a certain clan of gods. With my virtues, observances, austerities, and leading of the holy life I should be a god, or a certain god.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys, strives and prospers in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman these are interruptions, defects, spots and inconsistencies of the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman to this I say, leading an impure holy life enjoying sexuality not released from birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, unpleasantness displeasure and distress.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman, as long as these seven ways of enjoying sexuality were not dispelled in me I did not declare my rightful attainment of noble enlightenment to the world, together with gods and men, Māra, Brahma recluses and Brahmins and the Community of recluses and Brahmins.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge and vision arose to me, unshakable is my release, this sis my last birth, now there is no more rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said the Brāhman Jānussoṇi said to The Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, I understand! Remember me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</p>
