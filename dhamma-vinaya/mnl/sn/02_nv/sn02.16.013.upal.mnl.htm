					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by  Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p>2. Venerable Mahakassapa approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side.</p>

					<p>3. Sitting venerable Mahakassapa said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, what is the reason for this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Earlier there were few rules and many monks got established in extinction,<br />
					now there are many rules and few monks get established in extinction?'</p>

					<p>4. 'Kassapa, it happens thus when the good Teaching disappears and beings diminish.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are many rules and few monks get established in extinction.</p>

					<p>5. Kassapa, until an image of the True Teaching arises in the world,<br />
					the True Teaching does not disappear from the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When an image of the True Teaching arises in the world, the True Teaching disappears from the world.</p>

					<p>6. Kassapa, until an imitation of pure gold arises in the world, pure gold does not disappear from the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When an imitation of pure gold arises in the world,<br />
					pure gold disappears from the world.</p>

					<p>7. In the same way Kassapa, until an image of the True Teaching arises in the world,<br />
					the True Teaching does not disappear from the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When an image of the True Teaching arises in the world,<br />
					the True Teaching disappears from the world</p>

					<p>8-11. Kassapa, the earth element does not cause the disappearance of the True Teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">The water element ... re ... The fire element ... re ...</p>

					<p class="f4">The air element does not cause the disappearance of the True Teaching.</p>

					<p>12. There arises in this world foolish men who cause the disappearance of the True Teaching.</p>

					<p>13. A ship shows signs of sinking right from the beginning.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not happen to the True Teaching in that way.</p>

					<p>14. Kassapa, these five reasons conduce to the confusion and disappearance of the True Teaching.</p>

					<p>What five?</p>

					<p>15. Kassapa, here bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female become rebellious and live not revering the Teacher, the Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the Training and Concentration</p>

					<p>Kassapa, the entering of these five things, causes confusion and disappearance of the True Teaching.</p>

					<p>16. Kassapa, these five reasons conduce to the non confusion and non disappearance of the True Teaching.</p>

					<p>What five?</p>

					<p>17. Kassapa, here bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female become docile and live revering the Teacher, the Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the Training and Concentration</p>

					<p>18. Kassapa, these five things, cause non confusion and non disappearance of the True Teaching.'</p>
