					<p class="f4">'At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi. From there venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">''Friends, bhikkhus, it is said, 'Right view; the view, rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, how does the noble disciple come to this good Teaching?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Friend, we came from afar to hear the meaning of these words from venerable Sāriputta, good that the meaning occurs to venerable Sāriputta, hearing it from venerable Sāriputta, the bhikkhus will bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Then listen carefully and attend. When the noble disciple knows demerit and its roots, merit and its roots, with this much, the view rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, he comes to this good Teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, what is demerit, and what are the roots of demerit? Destroying life is demerit, taking the not given is demerit, misbehaviour in sensuality is demerit, telling lies is demerit, slandering is demerit, rough talk is demerit, frivolous talk is demerit, coveting is demerit, bearing the angry mind is demerit, and wrong view is demerit. These are demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What are the roots of demerit? Greed is a root of demerit, anger is a root of demerit, and delusion is a root of demerit. These are the roots of demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is merit? Abstaining from destroying life is merit. Abstaining from taking what is not given is merit. Abstaining from misbehaviour in sensuality is merit. Abstaining from telling lies is merit. Abstaining from slandering is merit. Abstaining from rough talk is merit. Abstaining from frivolous talk is merit. Abstaining from coveting is merit. Not bearing an angry mind is merit and right view is merit. These are merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What are the roots of merit? Non-greed is a root of merit. Non-hate is a root of merit. And non-delusion is a root of merit. These are the roots of merit. When the noble disciple knows demerit and roots of demerit, merit and roots of merit, he gives up all latent tendencies to greed, drives out all latent tendencies to aversion, and completely destroying the latent tendency to measure as 'I be', dispels ignorance, arouses science, and here and now makes an end of unpleasantness. With this much, the view rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, comes to this good Teaching.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those bhikkhus, accepting and delighting in the words of venerable Sāriputta asked, 'Friend, is there another method by which the noble disciple would rectify his view, be endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching and would come to this good Teaching?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is, friends. When the noble disciple knows supports, the arising of supports, the cessation of supports, and the path to the cessation of supports, with this much, the view rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, he comes to this good Teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, what are supports, what is the arising of supports, what is the cessation of supports, and what is the path to the cessation of supports? There are these four supports for the born, for their upkeep, and as help for those seeking birth. What four? Material supports hard and fine. Contact is second. Mental cognition is the third.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> And consciousness is the fourth. With the arising of craving arises supports, with the cessation of craving ceases supports. This same noble eightfold path is the path to the cessation of supports, namely, right view, right thoughts, right words, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. When the noble disciple knows, 'These are supports, this is the arising of supports, this is the cessation of supports, and this is the path to the cessation of supports,' he gives up all latent tendencies to greed, drives out all latent tendencies to aversion, and completely destroying the latent tendency to measure as 'I be', dispels ignorance, arouses science, and here and now makes an end of unpleasantness.

					<p class="f4">'Friends, what is unpleasantness? Birth, decay, ailments, death, grief, wailing, displeasure and distress, all these are unpleasant, if one does not get one's desires, that's also unpleasant. In short, the five holding masses are unpleasant. To this is called unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, what is the arising of unpleasantness? That same greed to be born again, accompanied with interest and greed, delighting in this and the other such as sensual greed, the greed 'to be' and the greed 'not to be', this is the arising of unpleasantness.

Decay, decrepitude, brokenness, greyness of hair, wrinkledness of skin, dwindling in age and the maturity of the faculties of this and other class of beings is decay.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends what is death? Disappearing, ceasing, breaking up and fading, ending in death, the breaking up of the holding masses, and laying down the body of this and other class of beings is death. This decay and this death is decay and death, With birth, decay and death arises; with the cessation of birth, decay and death cease. This same noble eightfold path is the path to the cessation of decay and death, namely, right view, right thoughts, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. When the noble disciple knows, 'This is decay and death, this is the arising of decay and death, this is the cessation of decay and death, and this is the path to the cessation of decay and death,' he gives up all latent tendencies to greed, drives out all latent tendencies to aversion, and completely destroying the latent tendency to measure as 'I be', dispels ignorance, arouses science, and here and now makes an end of unpleasantness.

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Mental cognition is the third: '<i>manos~ncetanā tatiyo</i>'. These are the hopes, wishes, desires, and aspirations about the future, intentions in the present, and recollections of the past. A person is supported on these and lives on account of them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> These three are the beings: <i>'tayo 'me āvuso bhavā</i>'. Being is the mind's behaviour in sensual thoughts, thinking about material and maintaining the mind in immaterial states.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These four are the holdings: <i>'cattāro 'me āvuso upādānā</i>'. This holding is something done with the mind. This fourfold holding consists of holding to sensuality, holding to views, holding to virtues, and holding to a self view (<i>tanhā paccayā upādāna, upādāna paccayā bhava</i>). The three links (craving, holding, and being) are mental links just before a birth. It's a birth of a thought. Craving starts at one or other of the mental spheres, i.e., through seeing, hearing, etc, and then the mental hold of it and being with it. This is a very subtle, quick procedure and it is very difficult to be observed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> With the arising of the six mental spheres arise contact: '<i>salāyatanasamudayā phassasamudayo</i>'. The arising of the mental spheres is the arising of a person who can see, hear, smell, etc.; it is this person who is subjected to a contact.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Bodily determination, verbal determination and mental determination: '<i>kāyasankhāro vaciisankhāro cittasankhāro</i>'. According to the Cuulavedalla Sutta (M. 44), Bhikkhuni Dhammadinnā explains it thus: bodily determinations are in- and out-breaths, as they are bound up with the body; without them the body would not function. Verbal determinations are thinking and pondering. Words always follow thinking and pondering. So thinking and pondering are verbal determinations. Mental determinations are perceptions and feelings; as perceptions and feelings are bound up with the mind, they are mental determinations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Desires on account of ignorance: '<i>avijjāsavo</i>'. These desires arise at one or the other of the mental spheres; that is, by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, or cognizing with the mind. The ignorance that arises is to take those desires as permanent, agreeabale, and as 'mine'. To dispel ignorance one has to dispel the view that these desires are permanent, agreeable, and 'they are mine'.</p>
