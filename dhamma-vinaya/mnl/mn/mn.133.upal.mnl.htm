					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery that offered warm water in Rājagaha. Venerable Samiddhi got up in the last watch of the night and went to wash his body in warm water having washed his body, came out and stood in one robe to dry his body. Then a certain deity illuminated the whole of the warm forest, approached venerable Samiddhi, stood on a side and said 'Bhikkhu, do you remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Do you remember it?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, learn the short and detailed expsition of the single auspicious attachment, it tells the fundamentalsof the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The deity saying this vanished from there. Venerable Samiddhi at the end of that night approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, I got up in the last watch of the night and went to wash my body in warm water having washed I came out and stood in one robe to dry my body. Then a certain deity illuminated the whole of the warm forest, approached me and stood on a side and said, bhikkhu, do you remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment? I said, Friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Do you remember it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the deity said, 'Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachmentand the deity also said Bhikkhu, learn the short and detailed expsition of the single auspicious attachment, it tells the fundamentalsof the holy life. saying this, the deity vanished from there. Venerable sir, what is the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu, then I will teach the exposition of the single auspicious attachment, listen attending carefully.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future,</p>

					<p class="f4">The past is over, the future has not come.</p>

					<p class="f4">These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise</p>

					<p class="f4">Not faltering and not moved, think about them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Today itself the dispelling should be done</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow death might come</p>

					<p class="f4">We will not have any associations with Death and his great army</p>

					<p class="f4">You should abide dispelling thus, day and night zealously,</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this and getting up from his seat went into his dwelling</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Blessed One was gone, it occurred to those bhikkhus. 'Friends, the Blessed One gave us this short exposition and without giving the detailed exposition, went into his dwelling</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, ... pe ... </p>

					<p class="f4">This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now who could give us the detailed exposition of this short exposition?</p>

It is possible for venerable Mahākaccāna to give the detailed exposition for this short exposition given by the Blessed One. What if we approached venerable Mahākaccāna and asked this. Then those bhikkhus approached venerable Mahākaccāna, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. 'Friend, Kaccāna, the Blessed One gave this short exposition and without giving the detailed exposition got up from the seat and went to his dwelling</p>
