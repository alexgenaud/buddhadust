					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika, in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahapajāpati Gotami approached the Blessed One with about five hundred bhikkhunis. They worshipped the Blessed One and stood on a side, and Mahapajāpati Gotami said to the Blessed One. 'Venerable sir, advise the bhikkhunis, give them a talk on the Teaching.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the elder bhikkhus were advising the bhikkhunis in turns. Venerable Nandaka did not like to advise the bhikkhunis when his turn came. The Blessed One then addressed venerable Ānanda. 'Ānanda. who will advise the bhikkhunis today?' 'Venerable sir, it is venerable Nandaka's turn and he does not like to advise the bhikkhunis,' The Blessed One then addressed venerable Nandaka. 'Nandaka, advise the bhikkhunis. Holy man, give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Teaching.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Venerable Nandaka agreed and the next moring, putting on robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in Sāvatthi. After collecting alms and when the meal was over, approached the monastery of the royal women. The bhikkhunis seeing venerable Nandaka approach prepared a seat and administered water to wash the feet. Venerable Nandaka sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis too worshipped venerable Nandaka and sat on a side. Then venerable Nandaka said to those bhikkhunis. 'Sisters, there will be a session of asking questions and replying them. Those who know should say, I know and those who do not know should say I do not know. When there is doubt or consternation, it should be asked from me, venerable sir, what is the meaning of this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, on account of this and other reason, there arises this and other feeling and when that reason subsides, the respective feeling fades.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as it really is with right wisdom.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sisters, of a standing huge tree full of heartwood, the root is impermanent, a changing thing. The trunk is impermanent, a changing thing.

					<p class="f4">'Sisters, a clever butcher or his apprentice would kill a cow with a sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small bits without hindering the internal flesh or the external skin. He would chop all the internal tissues, veins and ligaments, into small bits, as they stand and would put the cow together in the outer skin as it was and would say. This is the same cow complete in that same skin. Sisters, is that said correctly?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, it is not so, because, that clever butcher or his apprentice would kill a cow with a sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small bits without hindering the internal flesh or the external skin. He would chop all the internal tissues, veins and ligaments, into small bits, as they stand and would put the cow together in the outer skin as it was and would say. This is the same cow complete in that same skin. Yet, that cow is unyoked from the skin.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sisters, this is a comparison to explain the meanings. This is its meaning.

The Blessed One said. 'Sisters, go now, it's late,' Those bhikkhunis worshipped the Blessed One and went away respectfully with their right sides towards the Blessed One.

'Bhikkhus, Many people seeing the moon on the fourteenth day of waxing, do not entertain doubts such as is the moon incomplete or not, but that it is incomplete. In the same manner, the bhikkhunis are delighted hearing the Teaching, but their aims are not fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Holy man, give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Teaching (<i>karohi tvaɱ brāhmana, bhikkhuninaɱ dhammikathaɱ</i>). A holy man is one who has attained worthiness, one who has done the dispensation of t he Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The six internal spheres (<i>channetaɱ ajjhattikānaɱ āyatanānaɱ</i>) are the spheres of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The six external spheres (<i>channetaɱ bāhirānaɱ āyatanānaɱ</i>) are forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The bhikkhu destroying desires (<i>bhikkhu āsavānaɱ khayā</i>). Desire is the root cause for a person's transmigration from one birth to another. To stop this transmigration, the bhikkhu has to destroy desires.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Releases of the mind and releases through wisdom (<i>anāsavaɱ cetovimuttiɱ paññāvimuttiɱ</i>). The release of the mind is attained when the bhikkhu does not desire anything. The desiring starts with a contact at one or the other, of a door of mental contact, such as from a sight, sound, scent, taste, touch or an idea. To stop desiring the mind should be developed much. This is also called the release through knowing here and now. The living worthy ones 'arahantā' enjoy this bliss of not being touched by any of the contacts at any of the doors of mental contact. Should be something very pleasant. Someone released through wisdom does not enjoy this bliss yet, he has read much or heard much and knows what it is and he aims to attain that bliss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Here and now abides by himself knowing and realizing (<i>diṭṭh'eva dhamme sayaɱ abhiññā sacchikatvā upsampajja viharati</i>). Here and now means in this very life, the bhikkhu by himself knowing realizes that highest aim of a Buddhist, that is the worthy state.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The enlightenment factor of 'examining the Teaching' (<i>dhammavicayasambojjhangaɱ bhāveti</i>) is to consider the complete Teaching, not overlooking any minor details, to come to a grand decision, so that the ultimate aim could be attained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The enlightenment factor effort (<i>viriyasambhojjhangaɱ bhāveti</i>) is nothing but a mental effort to see that non arisen demerit does not arise, arisen demerit is dispelled, non arisen merit is aroused and arisen merit is developed and completed to the highest limit. This arisen merits are the developed mind such as the fruition of the entry into the stream of the Teaching, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The enlightenment factor joy (<i>pītisambojjhangaɱ bhāveti</i>) is some internal joy on account of complete confidence of the path, and enjoyed only by a disciple of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> And the enlightenment factor equanimity settled in seclusion, detachment and cessation maturing in surrender (<i>upekhāsambojjhaṇgaɱ bhāveti vivekanissitaɱ virāganissitaɱ nirodhnissitaɱ vossaggaparināmiɱ</i>). Here equanimity is developed, settled in seclusion, detachment and cessation, until everything is given up. This amounts to extinctlion.</p>
