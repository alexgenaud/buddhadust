<meta name="description" content="The Sister Upalavanna translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 126. The Buddha explains that it is not enough to have hopes, aspirations, yearnings for freedom from pain, one must behave in a way that brings pain to and end for that to happen. He provides four similes to illustrate this point: trying to get oil by pressing sand, trying to get milk by pulling a bull's horn, trying to get butter by churning water, and trying to light a fire with a wet sappy stick." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rājagaha. Venerable Bhumija put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes approached the home of prince Jayasena and sat on the prepared seat. Then prince Jayasena approached venerable Bhūnija, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. 'Good Bhumija, there are recluses and brahmins who hold this view and declare it. Leading the holy life with attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction Leading the holy life without attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction Leading the holy life with attachment and without attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction Leading the holy life neither with nor without attachment it is not possible to attain some distinction.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Without right and true insight, leading the holy life with attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction (<i>Āsaā ce pi karitvā ayoniso brahmacariyaɱ carati, abhabbo phalassa adhigamāya</i>). The complete sutta tells us that leading the holy life should be with right and true insight. i.e., The one leading the holy life should know for what purpose he is doing so. He should correctly understand the acutely unsatisfactory nature of life, and so make an effort to achieve a distincton above human. So then he should arouse effort to attain that distinction not yet attained.</p>
