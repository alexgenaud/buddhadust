					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery, the palace of Migara's mother, in Sāvatthi. On that full moon night of the fifteenth day the Blessed One sat in the open, attended by the Community of bhikkhus. Then the Blessed One observed the silent Community of bhikkhus and addressed them. 'Bhikkhus, does the unworthy one know the unworthy one, as this good one is unworthy?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, venerable sir, he does not know that.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good! Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the unworthy one should know the unworthy one, as this good one is unworthy. Bhikkhus, does the unworthy one know the worthy one, as this good one is worthy?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, venerable sir, he does not know that.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good! Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the unworthy one should know the worthy one, as this good one is worthy.
