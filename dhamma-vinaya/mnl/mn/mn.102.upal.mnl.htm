<meta name="description" content="The Sister Upalavanna translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 102. In this sutta the Buddha outlines various views about the nature of the real, essential self and the world, past, future and present and points out that these views are all speculative and that for true satisfaction and liberation one must let go of all that which has been constructed, including speculative opinions." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jet's grove in Sāvatthi.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, there are certain recluses and brahmans who declare views about the future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such as there will be a healthy perceptive self after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There will be a healthy non- perceptive self after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There will be a healthy neither perceptive nor non-perceptive self after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or else the annihilation, destruction and the non existence of the conscience.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or else the extinction here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These five are sometimes declared as three, as there is a healthy self after death, the annihilation, destruction and non existence of the conscience and extinction here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So these five sometimes become three and the three sometimes become five.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the short exposition of the five and the three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who make known a healthy perceptive self after death, declare of a material self or an immaterial self, or of a self that is material and immaterial, or else a self that is neither material nor immaterial.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or they make known of a healthy self, with a single perception, or with various perceptions, or a limited perception, or an unlimited perception, healthy after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A certain one overcoming the object, consciousness, declares of limitless imperturbability.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One knows those recluses and brahmins who make known a healthy perceptive self after death, declaring of, a material self or an immaterial self, or a self that is material and immaterial, or else a self that is neither material nor immaterial.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or of those that make known of a healthy self, with a single perception, or with various perceptions, or a limited perception, or an unlimited perception, healthy after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One also knows of these perceptions which are incomparably pure in the highest order, whether material or immaterial, whether a single perception, or various perceptions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He knows of the sphere of nothingness too, which is limitlessly imperturbable.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Knows that these are compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of determinations, knowing the escape from this, the Thus Gone One overcame them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins that declare of a non perceptive self healthy after death, declare of, a material, or an immaterial, or of a material and immaterial, or of a neither material nor immaterial non perceptive self healthy after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, a certain recluse or brahmin who declares a perceptive self healthy after death, would revile those recluses and brahmins.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the reason for that? Perception, is an ailment, an abcess, an arrow, this non perception is peaceful and exalted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One knows it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The recluses and brahmins who make known of a non-perceptive self healthy after death, declare of a material or immaterial, or a material and immaterial, or a neither material nor immaterial non-perceptive self healthy after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, if a recluse or brahmin was to say, I will make known the coming and going, disappearing and appearing, growth and development without matter, without feelings, without perceptions, without determinations and without consciousness, it is not a possibility.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is compounded and coarse, there is the cessation of determinations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone knowing the escape overcame it</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, those recluses or brahmins who make known of a neither perceptive nor non-perceptive self healthy after death, declare of a neither perceptive nor non perceptive self, of material, or of immaterial, or of material and immaterial, or of neither material nor immaterial.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here, bhikkhus, certain recluses or brahmins who declare a perceptive self healthy after death and those who declare a non-perceptive self healthy after death, revile those recluses and brahmins.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the reason for that? Perception, is an ailment, an abcess, an arrow, its delusion this neither peception nor non perception is peaceful and exalted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One knows it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those good recluses and brahmins who make known a neither perceptive nor non-perceptive self healthy after death, declare of a neither perceptive nor non perceptive self, of matter, or of non matter, or of matter and non matter, or of neither matter nor non matter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, whoever recluses and brahmins make known the mental achievements in the spheres of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touch with determinations, I declare these achievments as destruction.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, I declare these should not be achieved with determinations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">but come to the end of determinations.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of determinations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One seeing the escape, overcame it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, of those recluses and brahmins that make known, the perceptive self healthy after death, the non-perceptive self healthy after death and also the neither perceptive nor the non-perceptive self healthy after death, certain ones revile the recluses and brahmins who declare the annihilation, destruction and the non existence of the conscience.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the reason for that? All these good recluses and brahmins declare their attachments hanging upside down, saying we will be in the future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As it would occur to a merchant gone to trade, it will be to me thus, and I will make gains.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus, I will be in the future occurs to the recluses and brahmins as to the merchant gone to trade.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One knows.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those recluses and brahmins, who declare the annihilation, destruction and the non existence of the conscience, fear the self loathe it, and run round that same self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Like one bound to a wooden or iron post would run round and round the post.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same manner those recluses and brahmins, who declare the annihilation, destruction and the non existence of the conscience of the person, fear the self, loathe it, and run round that same self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of determinations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thus Gone One seeing the escape, overcame it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever recluses and brahmins declared views about the future did so declaring one or the other of the five of these.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, there are recluses and brahmins who make known views about the past.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They also get included in one or the other of these five.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are recluses and brahmins who declare views about the past such as the self and the world are eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false, the self and the world are not eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false, the self and the world are eternal and not eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false, the self and the world are neither eternal nor non eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false.</p>

					<p class="f4">The self and the world are of one perception, are of various perceptions, are of a limited perception, are of unlimited perception, this only is the truth all else is false.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The self and the world, is completely pleasant, is completely unpleasant, is pleasant and unpleasant, is neither unpleasant nor pleasant, this only is the truth all else is false.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who declare the view, the self and the world is eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That they should by themselves realize this pure view without a faith, a liking, hearsay, careful thinking and without a pleased view is not a possibility.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When there is something realized by these good recluses and brahmins by themselves, there should be a certain amount of purity in these recluses and brahmins, yet they tell of a holding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of determinations.</p>
