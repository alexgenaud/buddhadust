					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthiand the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: 'Bhikkhus, I will give you the Teaching, good at the beginning, in the middle and at the end, full of meanings in letters and words. It describes the complete and pure holy life, in six sixes. Listen to it attentively and carefully. 'Bhikkhus, you should know the six internal spheres, the six external spheres, the six bodies of consciousness, the six bodies of contact, the six bodies of feeling and the six bodies of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was said the six internal spheres should be known. Why was it said? Sphere of the eye, sphere of the ear, sphere of the nose, sphere of the tongue, sphere of the body, and sphere of the mind.

Inter action of the three is contact Tongue and tastes coming together arises tongue consciousness. Inter action of the three is contact Body and touches coming together arises body consciousness. Inter action of the three is contact Mind and thoughts coming together arises mind consciousness. Inter action of the three is contact.

					<p class="f4">If someone said eye is self; it could not be born. The arising and fading of the eye is evident. When the arising and fading of the eye is evident, it should go home to him my self is arising and fading. Therefore it is not suitable to say eye is self. Eye lacks self. If someone said forms are self; they could not be born. The arising and fading of forms are evident. When arising and fading of forms are evident, it should go home to him my self is arising and fading. Therefore it is not suitable to say forms are self. Thus eye lacks self and forms lack self. If someone said eye-consciousness is self; it could not be born. The arising and fading of eye consciousness is evident. When arising and fading of eye-consciousness is evident, it should go home to him my self is arising and fading. Therefore it is not suitable to say eye-consciousness is self. Thus eye lacks self, forms lack self and eye-consciousness lacks self. If someone said eye contact is self; it could not be born. The arising and fading of eye contact is evident.

If someone said craving is self; it could not be born. The arising and fading of craving is evident. When arising and fading of craving is evident, it should go home to him my self is arising and fading. Therefore it is not suitable to say craving is self. Thus eye lacks self, forms lack self, eye-consciousness lacks self, eye contact lacks self, feelings lack self, and craving lacks self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, on account of eye and forms arises eye-consciousness, inter action of the three is contact. On account of a contact arises feelings, pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Someone touched by a pleasant feeling, delights, welcomes and gets bound by it and the latent tendency to greed streams down to him. Touched by an unpleasant feeling, grieves, worries, wails, beats the breast and comes to bewilderment and the latent tendency to anger streams down to him. Touched by neither an unpleasant nor pleasant feeling, does not know the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and giving up of that feeling, as it really is, and the latent tendency to ignore streams down to him. Bhikkhus, it is not possible that he should end unpleasantness, here and now without dispelling ignorance and arousing science by dispelling the latent tendency to greed for pleasant feelings, the latent tendency to be angry for unpleasant feelings and the latent tendency to ignore neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflecting thus turns away from eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from ear, sounds, ear-consciousness, ear contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from nose, scents, nose-consciousness, nose contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from tongue, tastes, tongue-consciousness, tongue contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from body, touches, body-consciousness, body contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from mind, thoughts, mind-consciousness, mind contact, feelings and craving. Turning the mind away detaches it and releases it. Then knowledge arises, I'm released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done there is nothing more to wish.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said thus. Those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One. When this Teaching was given the minds of about sixty bhikkhus were released.</p>
