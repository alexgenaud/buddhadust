					<p class="f4">At one time venerable Mahāmoggallāna lived in the deer park, in the Bhesakalā forest among the Sumsumāra hills in the Bhagga country. Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even if the bhikkhus concede to be advised, if they are unruly, with unruly talk, not submisive to advice, the co-associates in the holy should think not to advise them and not take them into their confidence. Friends, what are the unruly things?</p>

Again the angry bhikkhu bears a grudge. The bhikkhu angry and bearing a grudge is an unruly thing. Become angry the bhikkhu has a cursing nature. The bhikkhu angry and cursing on account of that anger, is an unruly thing. Become angry the bhikkhu speaks angry words. The bhikkhu angry, speaking angry words, is an unruly thing. When reprimanded the bhikkhu retorts. The reprimanded bhikkhu retorting is an unruly thing. When reprimanded the bhikkhu reprimands in return.

The reprimanded bhikkhu not accepting admonition is an unruly thing, Again, the bhikkhu becomes hypocritical and unmerciful, the bhikkhu becoming hypocritical and unmercciful is an unruly thing. Again, the bhikkhu becomes jealous and selfish. The bhikkhu becoming jealous and selfish is an unruly thing. Again, the bhikkhu becomes crafty and fraudulent. The bhikkhu becoming crafty and fraudulent, is an unruly thing. Again, the bhikkhu becomes obstinate and holds a high opinion of himself. The bhikkhu becoming obstinate and holding a high opinion of himself is an unruly thing. Again, the bhikkhu stained with worldliness, holds to it tenaciously finding it difficult to give up. The worldly bhikkhu holding to views tenaciously and finding it difficult to give up, is an unruly thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even if the bhikkhus do not ask for advice, are suave have a gentle disposition, patient, and full of reverence when advised, the bhikkhus should think to advise them and take them into confidence. Friends, bhikkhus, what are suave things?</p>

					<p class="f4">'A bhikkhu not overcome by evil desires is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not praising himself and not disparaging others is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not angry and not bearing a grudge is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not angry and not cursing others is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not speaking angry words is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not retorting when reprimanded is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not counter charging when reprimanded is a suave thing. Again the reprimanded bhikkhu not leading the conversation aside and not showing anger and discontent, is a suave thing.

Again, the bhikkhu not crafty and fraudulent is a suave thing. Again, the bhikkhu not obstinate, not holding a high opinion of himself, is a suave thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, friends, by the bhikkhu himself should this observation be done: 'I do not like a person overcome by evil desires. In the same manner if I were overcome by evil desires, others would detest me; knowing this, I should arouse thoughts, not to be overcome by evil desires. I do not like a person praising himself and disparaging others, in the same manner, if I praise myself and disparage others, I would be detested.

I do not like a person who evades the question and becomes angry and discontented when repremanded, if I did this, others would detest me, knowing this. I should not evade the question and become angry and discontented when repremanded. I do not like a person who would not accept admonition after being reprimanded. If I did this othes would detest me, knowing this I should accept admonition after being reprimanded. I do not like a merciless hypocrite. If I became a merciless hypocrite, others would detest me, knowing this I should be merciful and no hypocrite. I do not like a jealous selfish person, If I were jealous and selfish, others would detest me, knowing this I should be not jealous and selfish. I do not like a crafty fraudulent person. If I were crafty and fraudulent, others would detest me, knowing this I should be not crafty and not fraudulent. I do not like an obstinate person who has a high opinion of himself. If I was obstinate and had a high opinion of myself, others would detest me, knowing this I should not be obstinate and hold a high opinion of myself. I do not like a worldly person who holds to views tenaciously and finds it difficult to give them up. If I was like that others would detest me. Knowing this, I should not hold to views tenaciously and should give them up with ease.</p>
