					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the country of the Kurus in a hamlet named Kammassadhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One slept on a spread of dried grass in the fire hut of a brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning the Blessed One,<br />
					putting on robes,<br />
					taking bowl and robes went the alms round,<br />
					in the hamlet Kammassadhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Returning from the alms round and after the meal was over the Blessed One entered a certain forest stretch,<br />
					and sat at the root of a certain tree,<br />
					to spend the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wandering ascetic Māgandiya wandering and walking for exercise entered the fire hut of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the spread of dried grass in the fire hut he said.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Bharadvaja,<br />
					for whom is this spread of dried grass prepared,<br />
					I think it's the bed of a recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Māgandiya,<br />
					it is the recluse Gotama's,<br />
					the son of the Sakyas.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has gone forth from the clan of the Sakyas.</p>

					<p class="f4">His fame is such,<br />
					the Blessed One is perfect,<br />
					rightly enlightened,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and conduct.<br />
					Well gone,<br />
					knows the worlds,<br />
					is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed,<br />
					is Teacher of gods and men,<br />
					enlightened and Blessed'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Bharadvaja,<br />
					we saw something we should not have seen,<br />
					it's the bed of that good Gotama,<br />
					the destroyer of humanity,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya,<br />
					be careful of what you say,<br />
					good Gotama has many wise warriors,<br />
					brahmins,<br />
					householders and recluses,<br />
					pleased and tamed in the noble Teaching and established in merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bharadvaja, I will meet that good Gotama,<br />
					and tell these words myself,<br />
					that the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by examining his bed,<br />
					that we do so,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'If it does not matter to good Māgandiya,<br />
					I will inform this to the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Be unconcerned, good Bharadvaja,<br />
					tell it if he asks.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One heard this conversation between the wandering ascetic Māgandiya and the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan,<br />
					with his purified heavenly ear element above human.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One got up from his seclusion in the evening,<br />
					and approached the fire hut of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Entering the fire hut,<br />
					he sat on the prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan approached the Blessed One worshipped,<br />
					exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One said,<br />
					to the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Was there any conversation between Bharadvaja and the wandering ascetic Māgandiya concerning this spread of grass?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was asked the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan shivered and his hairs stood on end, and said.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This we wanted to tell good Gotama,<br />
					and even before that<br />
					good Gotama tells it,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even when this conversation was taking place<br />
					the wandering ascetic Māgandiya<br />
					wandering and walking for exercise<br />
					entered the fire hut of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan,<br />
					and approached the Blessed One,<br />
					exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One<br />
					and sat on a side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the wandering ascetic Māgandiya.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, the eye is fond of forms,<br />
					intent on forms and delight in forms,<br />
					the eye of the Thus Gone One is tamed and protected.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches to protect and to restrain the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it on account of this,<br />
					that Māgandiya said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity,<br />
					by examining his bed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, the ear is fond of sounds,<br />
					the nose is fond of smells,<br />
					the tongue is fond of tastes,<br />
					intent on tastes,<br />
					and delight in tastes.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue of the Thus Gone One is tamed and protected.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches to protect and to restrain the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it on account of this,<br />
					that Māgandiya said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity,<br />
					by examining his bed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, the body is fond of touches,<br />
					...pe ...<br />
					The mind is fond of ideas,<br />
					intent on ideas and delight with ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of the Thus Gone One is tamed and protected.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches to protect and to restrain the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it on account of this,<br />
					that Māgandiya said,<br />
					the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity,<br />
					examining his bedstead.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, one is well provided with pleasing,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					forms cognizable by eye consciousness,<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the mean time he knows the arising,<br />
					fading,<br />
					the satisfaction,<br />
					the danger and the escape from forms,<br />
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dispels and destroys the burning and thirst for forms and internally appeases the mind and abides.</p>

					<p class="f4">What has Māgandiya to say to that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Gotama, I have nothing to say.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, one is well provided with pleasing, agreeable sounds<br />
					cognizable by ear consciousness,<br />
					... smells,<br />
					cognizable by nose consciousness,<br />
					... tastes<br />
					cognizable by tongue consciousness,<br />
					... touches,<br />
					cognizable by body consciousness<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the mean time he knows the arising,<br />
					fading,<br />
					satisfaction,<br />
					danger and the escape from touches,<br />
					as it really is He dispels and destroys the burning and thirst for touches and internally appeases the mind and abides.</p>

					<p class="f4">What has Māgandiya to say to that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Gotama, I have nothing to say.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, when I was a householder,<br />
					I was well provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures such as pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasing agreeable sounds,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable smells,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable tastes,<br />
					and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness,<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was provided with three palaces,<br />
					for the three seasons,<br />
					one for the rainy season,<br />
					one for the cold season and another for the hot season.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, I spent four months in the palace for the rainy season,<br />
					without males and provided with music,<br />
					not coming down to the lower story,<br />
					for any reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the mean time I knew,<br />
					the arising,<br />
					fading,<br />
					the satisfaction,<br />
					the danger and the escape from sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dispelled and destroyed the craving,<br />
					burning and thirst,<br />
					for sensual desires and internally appeased the mind and abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see other beings not satiated with sensuality,<br />
					while partaknig it being eaten by it and burnt by it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not envy them,<br />
					and do not take pleasure in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, I abide in that attachment away from sensuality,<br />
					away from thoughts of demerit,<br />
					and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in something lower than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, like a houshoulder,<br />
					or a householder's son,<br />
					quite wealthy and with many resources,<br />
					well provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such as pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness,<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasing agreeable sounds,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable smells,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable tastes,<br />
					and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness,<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">He behaves himself correctly by body, speech and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">After death, he goes to increase,<br />
					is born with the retinue of the thirtythree gods and partakes of the five strands of heavenly sensual pleasures attended by nymphs in the Nandana forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he sees a householder partake the five strands of sensual pleasures provided and well attended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, do you think,<br />
					this son of the gods,<br />
					partaking the five strands of heavenly bliss,<br />
					attended by those nymphs would envy that householder or the son of the householder and would come back for the five strands of sensual pleasures?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Heavenly sensual pleasures are superior and more exalted than human sensual pleasures,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the same manner, Māgandiya,<br />
					when I was a householder I was well provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures<br />
					such as pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasing agreeable sounds,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable smells,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable tastes,<br />
					and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness,<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the mean time I knew,<br />
					the arising,<br />
					fading,<br />
					the satisfaction,<br />
					the danger and the escape from sensuality as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I dispelled and destroyed the craving,<br />
					burning and thirst for senssuality and internally appeased the mind and abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see other beings not satiated with sensuality,<br />
					while partaking it being eaten and burnt by it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not envy them,<br />
					and do not take pleasure in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, I abide in that attachment away from sensuality,<br />
					away from thoughts of demerit,<br />
					and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in something lower than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, a lepor with a diseased,<br />
					decayed skin,<br />
					with worms attacking it,<br />
					would scratch the skin with his nails and would have open bruises and wounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would burn those wounds in a pit of embers and his friends,<br />
					co-associates and blood relations would call a doctor to attend on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After that treatment he would get over his leprosy,<br />
					and getting well would be able to go where he wished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would see another lepor with a diseased,<br />
					decayed skin,<br />
					with worms eating the skin,<br />
					and he scratching it for relief and burning the wounds and bruises in a pit of embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he envy that leper,<br />
					or the pit of embers,<br />
					or the treatment given?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, good Gotama, when he was diseased,<br />
					the treatment was necessary.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he got over the illness,<br />
					no more medicine is necessary,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the same manner, Māgandiya,<br />
					when I was a householder I was well provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasing agreeable sounds,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable smells,<br />
					— pleasing agreeable tastes,<br />
					and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness,<br />
					arousing fondness and sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the mean time I knew the arising,<br />
					fading,<br />
					the satisfaction,<br />
					the danger and the escape from sensuality as it really is I dispelled and destroyed the craving,<br />
					burning and the thirst for sensuality,<br />
					appeasing the mind internally abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see other beings partaking sensuality not satiated with it,<br />
					being eaten by it and burnt by it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not envy them,<br />
					and do not take pleasure in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, I abide in that attachment away from sensuality,<br />
					away from thoughts of demerit,<br />
					and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in something lower than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, a lepor with a diseased,<br />
					decayed skin,<br />
					worms attacking it,<br />
					would scratch the skin with his nails and would have open bruises and wounds,<br />
					would burn those wounds in a pit of embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">His friends, co-associates and blood relations would call a doctor to attend on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then treated by the doctor would get over his leprosy,<br />
					and getting well would be able to go where he wished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then two strong men would come along and pull this man along to the burning pit of embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, wouldn't his body writhe to get away from it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, good Gotama,<br />
					his body would writhe to get away from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama fire is unpleasant to contact,<br />
					the great heat causes much burning,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, fire is unpleasant to contact,<br />
					produces heat and causes burning to him, only now,<br />
					or was it unpleasant to contact,<br />
					produced heat and caused burning earlier too?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Gotama,<br />
					now and earlier too fire is unpleasant to contact,<br />
					produced heat and caused burning.</p>

					<p class="f4">The lepor with a diseased,<br />
					decayed skin,<br />
					worms attacking it,<br />
					scratched the skin with the nails and had open wounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">With a distorted mental faculty,<br />
					he experienced pleasantness in fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the result of a distorted perception,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, in the same manner,<br />
					even in the past sensual contact was unpleasant,<br />
					produced much heat and burning,<br />
					in the future too sensual contact will be unpleasant,<br />
					will produce much heat and burning,<br />
					and sensual contact at present too is unpleasant,<br />
					produces much heat and burning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, these beings not free of greed for sensuality,<br />
					destroyed by the greed for sensuality,<br />
					worried by sensual worries,<br />
					have distorted mental faculties and perceive the unpleasant contact of sensuality is pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, however much the lepor would scratch the diseased,<br />
					decayed skin,<br />
					eaten by worms and make,<br />
					openbruises and wounds and would burn the wounds in a pit of embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those wounds would not get better but worse and worse.</p>

					<p class="f4">The decay and the ill smell would get worse, and worse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever satisfaction he gets,<br />
					is through scratching the open wounds and scorching them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same manner Māgandiya,<br />
					beings not free of greed for sensuality,<br />
					destroyed with greed for sensuality,<br />
					worried by sensual worries,<br />
					partake of sensuality,<br />
					and in this and other way they grow their sensual greed and grow their sensual worries.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever little satisfaction they gain is through the five strands of sense pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, have you seen or heard of a king or the chief minister of a king,<br />
					provided and accomplished with the five strands of sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you seen such a one internally appeased,<br />
					without giving up that sensual,<br />
					greed,<br />
					burning and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or do you see such a one,<br />
					or will you see such a one in the future?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, good Gotama,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good! Māgandiya, you have understood it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too have not seen or heard of such a one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor will hear of such a one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, who ever recluses or brahmins abode in the past or abide now or will abide in the future,<br />
					gave up,<br />
					give up and will give up the thirst and burning for sensuality and internally appease themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">By knowing, sensuality,<br />
					the arising of sensuality,<br />
					fading of sensuality,<br />
					the satisfaction of sensuality,<br />
					its dangers,<br />
					and the escape from it,<br />
					as it really is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Blessed One utterred this solemn utterance.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'Health is the highest gain,<br />
					extinction is the highest bliss,<br />
					The eightfold path<br />
					is the path to peace and deathlessness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					the wandering ascetic Māgandiya said to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'These words of good Gotama are excellent,<br />
					such as Health is the highest gain,<br />
					and extinction,<br />
					is the highest bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too have heard these words said,<br />
					by the teachers of teachers of wandering ascetics.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Health is the highest gain,<br />
					extinction is the highest bliss.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, what is that health and what is that extinction?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was asked, Māgandiya stroked his own body and hands, saying,<br />
					'That health and extinction is here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Gotama, I'm now healthy and without ailments.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, like a man born blind,<br />
					would not see impure and pure forms,<br />
					would not see,<br />
					blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red or brown forms,<br />
					would not see even and uneven forms,<br />
					would not see the constellation,<br />
					the moon and the sun.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would hear a man with sight say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wonderful is a white garment,<br />
					pure and stainless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he goes in search of white.</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain man cheats him,<br />
					giving an oil sprayed coarse garment,<br />
					saying:<br />
					'Good man this is a white pure stainless garment.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He accepts it puts it on and pleased says delighted words:<br />
					'Wonderful is a white garment,<br />
					pure and stainless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, would that blind man,<br />
					knowing, seeing,<br />
					accept, wear and utter words of delight?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Gotama that man,<br />
					born blind would accept,<br />
					wear and utter words of delight not knowing and not seeing that oil sprayed coarse garment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would utter those words of delight,<br />
					'Wonderful is a white garment,<br />
					pure and stainless,' placing faith in the man who has sight,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, in the same manner,<br />
					wandering ascetics of other sects are blind,<br />
					not knowing and not seeing health and extinction,<br />
					would say this verse.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Health is the highest gain,<br />
					extinction is the highest bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, this verse was said,<br />
					by rightfully enlightened perfect ones of the past.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Health is the highest gain,<br />
					extinction is the highest bliss.<br />
					The eightfold path<br />
					is the peaceful path to deathlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this has become the ordinary one's verse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, this body is the birth place of ill health,<br />
					abscesses, troubles and ailments,<br />
					and you say it is good health and extinction.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should have the noble one's eye to know health and see extinction.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm pleased with good Gotama's Teaching:<br />
					Could good Gotama teach me so that I may know that health and see that extinction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, like a man born blind,<br />
					would not see impure and pure forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not see,<br />
					blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red or brown forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not see even and uneven forms and would not see the constellation,<br />
					the moon and the sun.</p>

					<p class="f4">His friends, co-associates and blood relations,<br />
					would get a surgeon to attend to his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He being treated and taking that medicine does not regain his sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, wouldn't that surgeon reap fatigue only?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, good Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, in the same manner I taught you showing the healthy state and showing extinction,<br />
					yet you do not know it and see it,<br />
					and it is only fatigue for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I'm pleased with good Gotama's Teaching:<br />
					Could good Gotama teach me so that I may know that health and see that extinction,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, like a man born blind,<br />
					would not see impure and pure forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not see blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red or brown forms,<br />
					nor even and uneven forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not see the constellation,<br />
					the moon and the sun.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would hear a man with sight saying,<br />
					'Wonderful is a white garment,<br />
					pure and stainless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes in search of white.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain man cheats giving him an oil sprayed coarse garment saying:<br />
					'Good man this is a white pure stainless garment.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He accepts it,<br />
					puts it on and pleased says delighted words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful is a white garment,<br />
					pure and stainless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">His friends, co-associates and blood relations,<br />
					would get a surgeon to attend to his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">That surgeon attends to him,<br />
					giving him purgatives for the head and stomach,<br />
					and nasal treatment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he regains his sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after, he regains his sight,<br />
					he dispels the interest and greed for the oil sprayed coarse garment,<br />
					and considers the man who gave it as an enemy and even thinks to kill him:<br />
					'Indeed since long I have been cheated by this man,<br />
					with this oil sprayed coarse garment.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Saying good man this is a wonderful white garment pure and stainess.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya, in the same manner manner I taught you showing the healthy state and showing extinction.<br />
					You know it and see it,<br />
					and together with the arising of that sight,<br />
					you dispel that interest and greed for the five holding masses.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, since a long time I have been cheated by this mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have been upholding matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have been upholding feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have been upholding perceptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have been upholding determinations and I have been upholding consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">On account of that holding there is being,<br />
					on account of being,<br />
					there is birth.<br />
					On account of birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					wailing,<br />
					unpleasantness,<br />
					and distress.<br />
					Thus is the arising of the whole mass of unpleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I'm pleased with good Gotama's Teaching,<br />
					could I be taught so that I get up delighted from this seat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then Māgandiya associate good friends,<br />
					when you associate good friends,<br />
					you hear the good Teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you hear the good Teaching,<br />
					you fall to the method of living according to the teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you fall to the method of living according to the Teaching,<br />
					you yourself realize the ill health,<br />
					the absces,<br />
					the arrow and the dart.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is here itself that the ill health,<br />
					the abscess,<br />
					the arrow and the dart should be completely removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the cessation of holding,<br />
					there comes the cessation of being,<br />
					with the cessation of being<br />
					comes the cessation of birth.<br />
					With the cessation of birth,<br />
					cease decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					wailing,<br />
					unpleasantness and distress.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, ceases the complete mass of unpleasantness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wandering ascetic Māgandiya, said to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now I understand venerable sir,<br />
					it is as though something over turned was reinstalled.</p>

					<p class="f4">As something covered, is made manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">As though the path was told to one who had lost his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">As though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark for those with sight to see forms The Blessed One has explained the Teaching in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I take refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I gain the going forth and the higher ordination in the dispensation of the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Māgandiya, whoever is of another sect seeking the going forth and the higher ordination in this dispensation should be on probation for four months,<br />
					after the four months,<br />
					if the bhikkhus are satisfied,<br />
					they would give the going forth and the higher ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is to see the improvement in the person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir if one of another sect,<br />
					would have to be on probation for four months,<br />
					I would be on probation for four years.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the bhikkhus,<br />
					when satisfied give me the going forth and the higher ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māgandiya gained the going forth and the higher ordination and soon after the higher ordination,<br />
					venerable Māgandiya abode withdrawn from the crowd diligent for dispelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">He here and now,<br />
					realized and attained that highest end of the yoke,<br />
					for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knew, birth is destroyed,<br />
					the holy life is lived,<br />
					what should be done is done,<br />
					there is nothing more to wish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Māgandiya became a perfect one.</p>
