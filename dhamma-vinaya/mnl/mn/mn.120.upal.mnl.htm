					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkus from there. 'Bhikkhus, I will tell the arising of intentions, listen carefully with attention. Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said: 'Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the high warriors at the breakup of the body, after death. He bears it in the mind, directs thoughts to it, develops that thought. Those intentions and that abiding, developed and made much, conduces to be born there. This is the path and method to be born there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the high brahmins, ... re ... high middle class, at the breakup of the body, after death. He bears it in the mind, directs thoughts to it, develops that thought, and those intentions. That abiding, developed and made much, conduces to be born there. This is the path and method to be born there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the four guardian gods with long life, beauty and much pleasantness, at the breakup of the body, after death. He bears it in the mind, directs his thoughts to it, develops that thought, and those intentions. That abiding, developed and made much, conduces to be born with the guardian gods with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the company of gods of the thirty-three. ... re ... with the Yāma gods, ... re ... with the happy gods, ... re ... with the gods attached to creating, ... re ... with the gods attached to creating others, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness, at the breakup of the body, after death.

The bhikkhu learns, Sahasa Brahmā, wields power over the thousandfold world systems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. He wields power over those born there. Like a wise man drawing a circle on his palm would reflect, in the same manner Sahasa Brahmā, wields power over the thousandfold world systems and wields power over those born there.

Catu Sahasā Brahmā, ... re ... Panca Sahasā Brahmā, wields power over the five thousandfold world systems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. He wields power over those born there. Like a wise man drawing five circles on his palm would reflect, in the same manner Panca Sahasa Brahmā, wields power over the thousandfold world systems and wields power over those born there. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with Panca Sahasā Brahma at the breakup of the body, after death. He bearsthat mind, directs thoughts to it and develops that thought.

					<p class="f4">and enjoy much pleasantness. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with gods of space with long life, much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Sankhāruppattisutta shows how living with intentions, directing thoughts to them, and developing those thoughts leads to the flowering of those intentions, desires, and thoughts. When desires are destroyed, the mind is released and there is no more birth.</p>
