					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived on the rock which devoured sages, and addressed the bhikkhus from there. 'Bhikkhus, do you see this Vebhāra rock?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, this Vebhāra rock had a different name and a different concept. Do you see this Paṇḍava rock?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, this Paṇḍava rock had a different name and a different concept. Do you see this Vepulla rock?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, this Vepulla rock had a different name and a different concept. Do you see this rock Gijja?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, this Gijja rock had a different name and a different concept. Do you see this Isigili rock?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, this Isigili rock had this same name and this same concept.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, in the past five hundred silent enlightened ones lived on this Isigili rock as permanent residents. People see them entering the rock and do not see them afterwards. People who saw this, said this rock devours sages, thus the name and concept came to birth. Bhikkhus, I will tell the names of those silent enlightened ones, we will honour the names of those silent enlightened ones. I will tell them listen carefully.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, the silent enlightened ones, Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, Tagarasikhī, Yasassī, Sudassana, Piyadassī, Gandhāra, Piṇḍola, Upāsabha, Nītha, Tatha, Suthava, Bhāvitatta, were permanent residents on this Isigili rock.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> They have pulled out the arrows (<i>tesaɱ visallānaɱ</i>). The Great Beings, it is said, have pulled out the arrows. The Great Beings are the four pairs who have attained the four paths and fruits. The arrows they have pulled out is their personal self views (<i>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i>). When this arrow is pulled out a lot of the unpleasantness disappears then and there and later all unpleasant disappears. Pullng out arrows is the attaining of paths and fruits.</p>
