					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Then venerable Sāriputta getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached the Blessed One, worshipped, and sat on a side. The Blessed One said to venerable Sāriputta. 'Sāriputta, your mental faculties are bright, skin colour is pure, in which abiding, do you spend your time mostly?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, I spend my time mostly in voidance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It's good Sāriputta, you abide mostly in the abiding of Great Beings. Sāriputta, a bhikkhu who desires to abide in voidance most of the time should reflect. When going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, does interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, arise in my mind on account of forms cognizable by eye consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, arises in my mind on account of forms cognizable by eye consciousness. Then he should arouse effort to dispel those evil thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, does not arise in my mind on account of forms cognizable by eye consciousness. Then he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again Sāriputta, when reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, does not arise in my mind on account of sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, ... re ... on account of scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, ... re ... on account of tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness, ... re ... on account of touches cognizable by body consciousness, ... re ... on account of thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness. He should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again Sāriputta the bhikkhu should reflect are my five strands of sensuality dispelled? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, my five strands of sensuality are not dispelled he should arouse effort to dispel the five strands of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again Sāriputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the four establishments of mindfulness developed in me?

When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the four establishments of mindfulness are developed in me, he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again Sāriputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the four right efforts developed in me?

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, whoever recluse or brahmin purified alms food in the past, did so reflecting in this manner. Whoever recluse or brahmin would purify alms food in the future, will do so reflecting in this manner. Whoever recluse or brahmin purifies alms food at present, do so reflecting in this manner. Sāriputta, you should train in this manner.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said thus and venerable Sāriputta delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Is my calm and insight developed? (<i>Bhāvitā nu kho me samatho ca vipassanā cāti?</i>) To develop calm is to pacify the mind by throwing out evil things of demerit in the mind and not leaving any room for them to rise again. To do this there are various methods to adopt and various signs to develop. The most suitable sign should be adopted at the relevant time. A few of them are reflecting in and out breaths, being aware of one's movements, being mindful of one's feelings, being mindful of one's mental states and thoughts etc. To develop insight is to be aware of the fact that everything is impermanent. That whatever impermanent thing, is unpleasant. And whatever impermanent, unpleasant thing lacks self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Is science and release realized by me? (<i>Sacchikatā nu kho me vijjā ca vimutti cāti?</i>) Science is the knowledge of the Truth of unpleasantness, the truth of its arising, the truth of its cessation and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. When this is realized the mind is released.</p>
