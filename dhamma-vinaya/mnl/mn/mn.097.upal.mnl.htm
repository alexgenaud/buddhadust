					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rājagaha. At that time venerable Sāriputta was touring the southern hilly regions with a large community of bhikkhus. A certain bhikkhu who had spent the rains in Rajagaha approached venerable Sāriputta and exchanged friendly greetings and sat on side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta asked him. 'Venerable one, is the Blessed One without ailments and has he a light living?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable one, the Blessed One is without ailments and has a light living.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is the Community of bhikkhus, are they without ailments, and with a light living?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, venerable one, the Community of bhikkhus, too are without ailments and they too have a light living.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable one, there is the Brahmin Dhānanjāni, who has power over fields and grains. Is he without ailments and in good health?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Brahmin Dhānanjāni is powerful and in good health.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is he living diligently?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable one where's diligence to the Brahmin Dhānanjāni? On account of the kings he plunders the Brahmin householders. On account of the Brahmin householders he plunders the kings. His wife who had faith, brought from a family, which had faith in the Blessed One, has died. Now he has brought a wife from a family, which has no faith and she has not faith.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'We heard something that should not be heard, about the negligence of the Brahmin Dhānanjāni. Indeed we should meet the brahamin Dhānanjāni and have a conversation about this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta abiding as long as he wished in the southern hilly regions, left on a tour to reach Rajagaha in stages. Venerable Sāriputta was then abiding in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Venerable Sāriputta put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Rajagaha for alms. At that time the Brahmin Dhānanjāni was milking the cows out side the city close to it. Venerable Sāriputta having gone the alms round, and after the meal was over approached the Brahmin Dhānanjāni. The Brahmin, seeing venerable Sāriputta approaching in the distance said. 'Good sir, Sāriputta, there is milk, the time to partake has not elapsed yet,'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Useless, Brahmin, I have finished with today's meal, I will be spending the day under that tree come there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brahmin Dhānanjāni agreeing, after partaking his meal approached venerable Sāriputta, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then venerable Sāriputta asked. 'Brahmin, do you live diligently?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good, sir, Sāriputta, where is diligence to me. I have to support my mother and father, sons and wife, my servants and workmen.

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to venerable Sāriputta, these Brahmins intend to be born in the world of Brahmā. I will show him the path, to be born with Brahmā, and said. 'DhānanjāniI will teach you the path to the world of Brahmā, listen carefully,'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brahmin Dhānanjāni agreed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta said. 'Brahmin, this is the method to be born with Brahmā. Dhānanjāni. The bhikkhu pervades one direction with thoughts of loving kindness, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all circumstances, the entire world, is pervaded with the thought of loving kindness grown great and immeasurable without anger and ill will.

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. 'Bhikkhus, Sāriputta, has established the consciousness of the Brahmin Dhānanjāni for birth in the world of Brahmā, when he should have raised it to a higher degree, got up from his seat and came away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Sāriputta, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. 'Venerable sir, the Brahmin Dhānanjāni is seriously ill and he said. 'I worship the feet of the Blessed One with my head at the feet of the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sāriputta, when the mind of the Brahmin Dhānanjāni, could have been raised to a higher degree, why did you establish it in the lower Brahmā world?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, it occurred to me thus these Brahmins intend to be born in the world of Brahmā. I will show him the path, to be born with Brahmā.'</p>
