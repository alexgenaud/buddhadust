					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi. At that time to a bhikkhu named Sāti the son of a fisherman this view had arisen: As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else. Many bhikkhus, heard that this evil view had arisen to a bhikkhu, named Sāti the son of a fisherman: 'As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'. Then those bhikkhus approached, bhikkhu Sāti the son of a fisherman and asked: Friend, Sāti, is it true, that such an evil view has arisen to you: 'As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'Yes, friends, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else. Then those bhikkhus, desirous of dissuading the bhikkhu Sāti from that evil view, cross questioned, asked for reasons and studied with him: Sāti, do not say that, do not blame the Blessed One. It is not good to blame the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say this. The Blessed One has said in various ways, that consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause there is no arising of consciousness. Even when those bhikkhus, cross questioned, asked for reasons and studied together with him, he held on to his evil view tenaciously and would not give it up and said. 'As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'</p>

					<p class="f4">As those bhikkhus could not dissuade the bhikkhu Sāti from that evil view, they approached the Blessed One, worshipped, and sat on a side. They said to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, to a bhikkhu named Sāti the son of a fisherman this view has arisen: 'As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else' Then we approached the bhikkhu Sāti and asked him. Friend, Sāti, is it true, that such an evil view has arisen to you: 'As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'. Venerable sir, bhikkhu Sāti said thus to us. Yes, friends, 'as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else'. Then, we bhikkhus, desirous of dissuading the bhikkhu Sāti from that evil view, cross questioned, asked for reasons and studied with him: Sāti, do not say that. Do not blame the Blessed One. It is not good to blame the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say this. The Blessed One has said in various ways, that consciousness is dependently arisen. Without a cause there is no arising of consciousness. Even when we cross questioned, asked for reasons and studied together with him, he held on to his evil view tenaciously and would not give it up. As we could not dissuade the bhikkhu Sāti from that evil view, we approached the Blessed One, to inform about this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: Come! Bhikkhu, address the bhikkhu Sāti in my words, tell that the Teacher wants him That bhikkhu agreed and approached the bhikkhu Sāti and said the Blessed One wants you. Bhikkhu Sāti said yes friend and approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu Sāti: Sāti, is it true, that such an evil view has arisen to you. 'As I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness tansmigrates through existences, not anything else'. Yes, venerable sir, as I know the Teaching of the Blessed One, this consciousness transmigrates through existences, not anything else. Sāti, how is that conscciousness? Venerable sir, this uttering and feeling one, that reaps the results of actions good and evil done here and there. Foolish man, to whom do you know me having preached this Teaching. Haven't I told, in various ways that consciousness is dependently arisen. Without a cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet, you foolish man, because of your wrong grasp, blame me, destroy yourself, and accumulate much demerit and that will be for your undoing and unpleasantness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, Bhikkhus, what do you think, shouldn't this bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman be chastised from this dispensation of the Teaching. What is good, venerable sir, why shouldn't we? When this was said, the bhikkhu Sāti became silent, confused, with drooping body and face turned down, sat down unable to reply. Then the Blessed One knowing that bhikkhu Sāti son of a fisherman has become silent, confused, was unable to reply. Said thus to him. Foolish man you will be pointed out with your evil view. Now I am going to question the bhikkhus on this. Then the Blessed One, addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, do you too know this Teaching, wrongly grasped by the bhikkhu Sāti the son of a fisherman. By that he blames me. Destroys himself, and accumulates much unpleasantness. No, venerable sir. In various ways we are told, that consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause there is no arising of consciousness. Bhikkhus, it is good, you know the Teaching preached by me. In various ways I have preached that consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet, this bhikkhu Sāti son of a fisherman, grasping this wrong view blames me and destroys himself, and accumulates much demerit. It will be for his undoing and unpleasantness for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, founded on whatever, consciousness arises, it is reckoned on that. On account of eye and forms arises consciousness, it's reckoned eye consciousness. On account of ear and sounds arises consciousness, it's reckoned ear consciousness. On account of nose and smells arises consciousness, it's reckoned nose consciousness. On account of tongue and tastes arises consciousness, it's reckoned tongue consciousness. On account of body and touches arises consciousness, it's reckoned body consciousness. On account of mind and ideas arises consciousness, it's reckoned mind consciousness. Bhikkhus, just as based on whatever fire burns, it is reckoned by that. Fire ablaze with sticks is stick fire. Ablaze with twigs is twig fire. Ablaze with grass is grass fire. Ablaze with cow dung is cow dung fire. Ablaze with grain thrash is grain thrash fire. Ablaze with dirt is dirt fire. In the same manner consciousness on account is eye and forms is eye consciousness. Consciousness on account of ear and sounds is ear consciousness. Consciousness on account of nose and smells is nose conscioussness. Consciousness on account of tongue and tastes is taste consciousness. Consciousness on account of body and touches is body consciousness. Consciousness</p>

					<p class="f4">on account of mind and ideas is mind consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, do you see, that it has arisen? Yes, venerable sir. Do you see, that it arises supported? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, Do you see, that if the support ceases, the arising too ceases? Yes, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, when not sure whether it has arisen do doubts arise? Yes, venerable sir. When not sure, whether it is supported, do doubts arise? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, when not sure with the support ceasing the arisen too would cease, do doubts arise? Yes, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, do doubts of one fade, when he sees with right wisdom, that it has arisen? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, do doubts of one fade, when he sees with right wisdom, that they arise supported? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, do doubts of one fade, when he sees with right wisdom that with the cessation of supports the arisen too would cease? Yes, venerable sir</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this has arisen, are you with dispelled doubts about that? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, this has arisen supported, are you with dispelled doubts about that? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, when the support ceases the arising too ceases, are you with dispelled doubts about that? Yes, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, do you clearly see, as it really is, with right wisdom, this is arising? Yes,venerable sir. Bhikkhus, do you clearly see, with right wisdom, that this arises supported? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, do you clearly see, with right wisdom, that when the support ceases the arising too ceases? Yes, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkkhus, this view, so clean and pure, if you covet, fondle, treasure and take pride in it do you know this Teaching comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up and not for the purpose of holding? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, this view of yours so clean and pure, do not covet, fondle, treasure and take pride in it. Do you know this Teaching comparable to a raft, taught for the purpose of giving up and not for the purpose of holding? Yes, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, these four are the supports, for the arisen for the upkeep of beings and as help for those seeking birth. What four. Material food, coarse or fine, the second is contact, mental cogitation is third and consciousness is fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus,from what do these four supports originate, rise, take birth and develop? </p>

					<p class="f4">These four supports originate, rise, take birth and develop from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, from what does craving originate, rise, take birth and develop? </p>

					<p class="f4">Yet bhikkhus, you who know thus and see thus, would your mind run to the past? Was I in the past or was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Being who was I in the past? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, would your mind who knows and see thus, run to the future? Will I be in the future, or will I not be in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? Who will I be in the future? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, you who know, and see thus, would you have doubts of the present? Am I, or am I not? What am I? How am I? This being from where did it come? Where will it go? No, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet bhikkhus, you who know and see thus would you say, we have reverence for the Teacher. We say it out of reverence to the Teacher? No, venerable sir. Yet bhikkhus, you who know and see thus would you say. Our recluse said it, these are the recluse's words. We do not say that? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, you who know and see thus would you seek another teacher? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, you who know and see thus, would you see essence in religious rites, ceremonies and festivals of other recluses and brahmins? No, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, isn't it that you by youself knowing, seeing and experiencing say it? Yes, venerable sir. Good! O! bhikkhus, I have led you up in this Teaching. It is here and now. Time does not matter. It is open to inspection, leads to the beyond and is to be experienced by the wise, by themselves. Bhikkhus, if it was said the Teaching is here and now. Time does not matter, is open to inspection, leads to the beyond and is to be realised by the wise by themselves, it was said on account of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, with the coming together of three things a descent to the womb comes about: Here the mother and father come together. It is not the season of the mother. The one to be born does not attend Then there is no descent to the womb. Here, mother and father come together. It is the season of the mother. The one to be born does not attend. Then there is no descent to the womb. Here mother and father come together. It is the season of the mother and the one to be born attends. Then there is a descent to the womb. That mother protects the womb for nine or ten months with great anxiety and trouble. After nine or ten months that mother gives birth with great anxiety and trouble. She supports the born with her own blood. In the noble ones' dispensation mother's milk is called blood. Bhikkhus, that boy grows and his faculties mature and he plays games that boys play. Such as mock games as taking a bowl, turning somersaults, making toy wind mills with palm leaves, making small carts and bows. Bhikkhus, that boy, grows and his faculties develop and is provided with the five strands of sense pleasures, and he lives enticed by pleasing agreeable forms cognisable by eye consciousness, agreeable sounds cognisable by ear consciousness, agreeable smells cognisable by nose consciousness, agreeable tastes cognisable by tongue consciousness and agreeable touches cognisable by body consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He seeing a form with the eye becomes greedy for a pleasant form, or averse to a disagreeable form. Abides with mindfulness of the body not established and with a limited mind. Not knowing the release of mind nor the release through wisdom as it really is, where thoughts of demerit cease completely.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> He falls to the path of agreeing and disagreeing and feels whatever feeling, pleasant, unpleasant, or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Delighted and pleased with those feelings he appropriates them. To him delighted, pleased and appropriating those feelings arises interest. That interest for feelings is the holding* 12) To him holding, there is being, from being arises birth, from birth decay and death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress, thus arises the complete mass of unpleasantness. Hearing a sound with the ear, cognising a smell with the nose, cognising a taste with the tongue, cognising a touch with the body, cognising an idea with the mind, becomes greedy for a pleasant idea. Becomes averse to a disagreeable idea. Abides with mindfulness of the body not established and with a limited mind. Not knowing the release of mind nor the release through wisdom as it really is. Not knowing how thoughts of demerit cease completely. He falls to the path of agreeing and disagreeing and feels whatever feeling, pleasant, unpleasant, or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Delighted and pleased with those feelings, appropriates them. To him delighted, pleased and appropriating those feelings arise interest. That interest for feelings is the holding.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> To him holding, there is being, from being arises birth, from birth decay and death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress, thus arises the complete mass of unpleasntness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is born in the world perfect rightfully enlightened. Endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He proclaims to this world of gods and men, together with its Māras, Brahmās, the community of recluses, brahmins, gods and men. The Teaching good at the beginning, in the middle and in the end. Full of meaning even in the letters and declaring the complete and pure holy life. A householder, or the son of a householder or one born in some clan, hears the Teaching and gains faith in the Thus Gone One. With that gain of faith reflects. The household life is full of difficulties, is a defiling path. Going forth is like open space. Living in a household it is not easy to lead a holy life complete and pure without being defiled. What if I. shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes and go forth as a homeless. At some suitable time he gives up a little wealth or a large mass of wealth. Leaves behind a small circle of friends, or a large circle of friends. Shaving head and beard and donning yellow clothes goes forth as a homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone forth he becomes a trainer in the life of a bhikkhu, gives up hurting living things, throwing away stick and weapon, ashamed and compassion aroused, abides with compassion for all beings. Abstaining from taking what is not given, desires the given, the self made pure without thieving he abides. . Abstaining from low sexual intercourse leads the holy life. Abstaining from telling lies becomes reliable and trustworthy and abides without a dispute with the world. Gives up slandering, hearing here does not say it elsewhere, to split these. Hearing elsewhere does not say it here to split those. Thus he unites the split, promotes unity, fond of unity talks words to unite. Giving up rough talk, says pleasant words pleasing to the ears. Says words going straight to the heart of the populace at large. Abstains from frivolous talk. Says appropriate words, that are truthful, meaningful, in accordance with the Teaching and Discipline, those words that could be treasured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstains from destroying seed groups and vegetable groups. Partaking one meal a day, abstains from food at night and at untimely hours. Abstains from dance, singing, music, decorations, flowers and scents, ointments and adornments. Abstains from high and stately beds. Abstains from accepting gold and silver, uncooked rice and uncooked flesh, Abstains from accepting women and girls, slaves, men or women, Abstains from accepting goats, cows, fowl, pigs, elephants, cattle, horses and mares.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstains from accepting fields and wealth. Abstains from doing the work of a messenger and buying and selling. Abstains from unfair ways of weighing and measuring. Abstains from cutting severing, destroying and highway robbery, and wrong ways of obtaining morsel food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Satisfied, covering the body with robes, feeding the belly with morsel food, goes with all the belongings where ever he goes. Like the birds small and large that go with the weight of their wings. Likewise satisfied covering the body with robes, feeding the belly with morsel food, goes with all the belongings where ever he goes. Endowed with this mass of virtues, he experiences the pleasure of blamelessness internally. Seeing a form with the eye, does not take the sign or the elements. To one abiding with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled, may trickle demerit and displeasure by coveting. He abides protecting the mental faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound with the ear, Cognizing a smell with the nose, tasting a taste with the tongue, Cognizing a touch with the body, Cognizing an idea with the mind, does not take the sign or the elements. To one abiding, with the mental faculty of the mind uncontrolled, may trickle demerit and displeasure by coveting. He abides protecting the mind. Endowed with the noble ones' control of the mental faculties, he experiences the untouched pleasure of the mental faculties Coming forward and returning is aware, looking on and aside is aware. Bending and stretching is aware. Bearing bowl and the three robes is aware. Tasting, drinking, eating and enjoying is aware. Going, standing, sitting, lying, awake, and keeping silence is aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with this mass of virtues, this control of the mental faculties of the noble ones, the mindful awareness of the noble ones abides in a secluded dwelling, a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto or cave, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space, or a heap of straw. Returning from the alms round after the meal is over, sits in a cross-legged position, the body placed straight and mindfulness established in front.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispelling covetousness for the world he abides, cleaning the mind of covetousness Dispelling anger he abides cleaning the mind of anger with compassion for all born Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides, mindful and aware of a perception of light, cleaning sloth and torpor from the mind. Dispelling restlessness and worry he abides with a mind internally appeased, cleaning the mind of restlessness and worry. Abides with doubts dispelled of meritorious things that should be done</p>

					<p class="f4">The bhikkhu dispelling the five hindrances of the mind and wisely making the minor defilements weak, turns out sensual thoughts and thoughts of demerit. With thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to abides in the first <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind, internally appeased in one point, with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attained to abides in the second <i>jhāna</i>. Again the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful and aware, with the body experiencing pleasantness too attained to abides in the third jhana. To this the noble ones say mindfully abiding in pleasantness with equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, with mindfulness purified with equanimity attained to abides in the fourth <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">He seeing a form with the eye does not greed for a pleasant form, nor become averse to a disagreeable form. Abides with mindfulness of the body established and with a limitless mind, knowing the release of mind and the release through wisdom as it really is, where thoughts of demerit cease completely. Dispelling agreeing and disagreeing feels whatever feeling, pleasant, unpleasant, or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Neither delighted nor pleased with those feelings does not appropriate them. To him neither delighted, nor pleased and not appropriating those feelings the interest for them ceases. When interest ceases the holding ceases. When holding ceases being ceases. When being ceases birth ceases. When birth ceases decay and death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress cease. Thus the complete mass of unpleasantness. ceases. Hearing a sound with the ear, cognising a smell with the nose, cognising a taste with the tongue, cognising a touch with the body, cognising an idea with the mind, does not become greedy for a pleasant idea. Does not become averse to a disagreeable idea. Abides with mindfulness of the body established and with a limitless mind, knowing the release of mind and the release through wisdom as it really is, where thoughts of demerit cease completely. Dispelling agreeing and disagreeing feels whatever feeling, pleasant, unpleasant, or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Neither delighted nor pleased with those feelings does not appropriate them. Then the interest for those feelings cease. When interest ceases the holding ceases. When holding ceases being ceases. When being ceases birth ceases. When birth ceases decay and death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress, cease. Thus the complete mass of unpleasantness ceases. Bhikkhus, remember this as the destruction of unpleasantness in short. As for the bhikkhu Sāti the son of a fisherman is bound in a net of much craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Bhikkhus, do you see that it has arisen? <i>'bhūtamidanti bhikkhave passathā'</i> ti.The Blessed One alludes it, to consciousness. Birth arises from being (<i>bhava paccayā jāti ti</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Being arises from holding (<i>upādāna paccayā bhavo</i>), and</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> holding arises from craving (<i>tanhā paccayā upādānaɱ</i>), and</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> craving arises from feelings (<i>vedanā paccayā taṇhā</i>). Turning this the other way around we see that the centre point is feeling. It is from a feeling that craving, holding, being, and birth come about. With a contact there is a feeling. On account of the feeling there is craving, Craving is the interested following up of the feeling, either with like or dislike. Then there is a mental hold of this situation, on account of which is being, that is being with those feelings, perceptions and thoughts. On account of this there is birth. It's the birth of a thought. Or even birth too happens in this manner.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Feelings arise from contact (<i>phassa paccayā vedanā</i>). Contact is impingement at one or the other of the doors of mental contact, which causes to arouse feelings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Contact arises from the six mental spheres (<i>salāyatana paccayā phasso</i>). Contact is for someone who has his six spheres of mental contact, and has a self to wake, at any moment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The six mental spheres arise from name and matter (<i>nāma rūpa paccayā salāyatanaɱ</i>). The waking of the self complete with his six doors of mental contact takes place at one or the other of the doors of mental contact. This point of waking is called name and matter. Name are the fivefold reactions of the mind in the form of feelings, perceptions, attention, contact and mental cogition. Matter is this body of ours together with the doors of mental contact, and the various things that matter at the doors, such as sights, sounds etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Name and matter arises from consciousness (<i>viññāna paccayā nāma rūpaɱ</i>). There should be a conscious door, eye, ear or anything else, for name and matter to take birth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Consciousness arises from determinations (<i>sankhāra paccayā viññānaɱ ti</i>). Determinations are threefold, as bodily,verbal and mental. Bodily determinations are in and out breaths, verbal determinations are thinking and pondering and mental determinations are feelings and perceptions. When these internal and prior activities of breathing, thinking, feeling and perceiving are present, there a consciousness would arise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Determinations arise from ignorance (<i>avijjhā paccayā sankhārāti</i>). These activities of breathing, thinking, pondering, feeling and perceiving is on account of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Abides with mindfulness of the body not established, not knowing the release of mind and the release through wisdom, where thoughts of demerit cease completely (<i>anupaññhita kāya sati vā viharati paritta cetaso tanca ceto vimuttiɱ paññā vimuttiɱ yatā bhūtaɱ nappajānāti</i>). The release of mind is gained when the bhikkhu completely handles the control of his mental faculties. Such a one enjoys the non-touched pleasure of his doors of mental contact. This is also called the release through knowing. The release through wisdom is gained by attaining to the <i>jhāna</i>s, ascending from the first and descending from the top most. Throughout these abidings, the mind ceases to behave in demerit. When the mind abides in jhāanas and higher abidings, the message should be registered in the mind, that those pure states of mind are impermanent, so unpleasant, and it is foolish to take them as me or mine. This is for the purpose of giving up the self view (<i>sakkāyadiññhi</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> The interest for feelings is the holding (<i>yā vedanāsu nandi tad-upādānaɱ</i>). This is one of the twelve links of dependent arising. Here the Blessed One points out how we should pierce through from one of these links, so that we could see dependent cessation. It is this interest for feelings that we have to dispel little by little. Reading the discourse several times would be helpful, for realising dependent arising and dependent cessation.</p>
