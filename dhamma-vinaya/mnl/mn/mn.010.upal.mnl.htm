					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the hamlet named Kammāssadhamma in the Kuru country. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: 'Bhikkhus, there is only one way for the purification of beings, for ending grief and lament, to overcome unpleasantness and displeasure and to realize extinction and that is this fourfold establishment of mindfulness. What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Abiding reflecting the body in the body, mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Abiding reflecting the feeling in feelings, mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Abiding reflecting the thought thoughts, mindful and aware, to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu abide reflecting the body in the body? Here, the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty house, sits cross-legged, the body erect and mindfulness established in front. He mindfully breathes in and out. Breathing in long he knows, 'I breathe in long.' Breathing out long knows, 'I breathe out long.' Breathing in short knows, 'I breathe in short.' Breathing out short knows, 'I breathe out short.' He trains, 'feeling the whole body I breathe in. Feeling the whole body I breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He trains, 'Calming the bodily determination I breathe in, calming the bodily determination I breathe out.' Just as a clever turner or his apprentice, pulling the bellows long knows, 'I pull them long,' and pulling the bellows short knows 'I pull them short.' In the same manner, breathing in long, knows 'I breathe in long;' breathing out long, knows 'I breathe out long.' Breathing in short knows, 'I breathe in short,' and breathing out short knows 'I breathe out short.' He trains, 'Calming the bodily determination I breathe in, calming the bodily determination I breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally, or he abides reflecting the body in the body exterrnally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body, Or he establishes mindfulness, 'There is a body,' and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu, going knows, 'I go;' standing, knows 'I stand;' Sitting, knows 'I sit;' lying, knows, 'I lie.' What and whatever posture the body maintains, that and that he knows.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally, or he abides reflecting the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he establishes mindfulness, 'There is a body,' and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again the bhikkhu becomes aware, going forward or turning back, looking on, or looking about, bending, or stretching, He becomes aware bearing the three robes and bowl, becomes aware enjoying, drinking, eating, or tasting. He becomes aware going, standing, sitting, lying, speaking, or keeping silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he establishes mindfulness, 'There is a body,' and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body up from the sole, down from the hair on the top, and surrounded by the skin as full of various impurities. There are in this body, head-hair, body-hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, veins, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, lower intestines, bowels, stomach, excreta, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, eye secretions, saliva, snot, oil of joints, and urine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just like a bag of provisions open on both sides, is filled up with various grains such as rice, paddy, green grams, beans, sesame, and fine rice. A man who could see would pull it out and reflect, 'This is rice, this paddy, this green grams, this beans, this sesame, and this is fine rice.' In the same manner the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body, up from the sole, down from the hair on the top, and surrounded by the skin as full of various impurities. There are in this body, head-hair, body-hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, veins, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, lower intestines, bowels, stomach, excreta, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, eye secretions, saliva, snot, oil of joints, and urine.</p>

Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he establishes mindfulness, 'There is a body,' and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as elements in whatever posture it is. There are in this body, the elements, earth, water, fire, and air. Just as a clever butcher or his apprentice would be seated in a hut at the four crossroads with a killed cow dissecting it into small bits. In the same manner, in this body, there are the elements earth, water, fire, and air.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he establishes mindfulness, 'There is a body.' and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu reflects this body as a dead body thrown in the charnel ground, either after one day, two days or three days, bloated, turned blue and festering. This body too is subject to that same, has not gone beyond it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting thearising of thoughts in the body, Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body, Or he establishes mindfulness, 'There is a body,' and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as a dead body thrown in the charnel ground eaten by hawks, vultures, dogs, foxes, or by various other living things. This body too is subject to that same, has not gone beyond it.</p>

Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as a corpse thrown in the charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood and connecting veins. .. A skeleton without flesh, smeared with blood and connected with veins. .. a skeleton flesh and blood gone, connected by veins ... a disconnected skeleton thrown about everywhere. In one place a hand bone, in another a foot bone, in another a knee bone, in another a thigh bone, in another a hip bone, in another the back bone, in another the skull. This body too is subject to that same, has not gone beyond it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body externally.

Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as a corpse thrown in the charnel ground bones turned white like the colour of pearls, bones rotten and turned to powder. This body too is subject to that same, has not gone beyond it.</p>

Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu abide reflecting the feeling in feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, the bhikkhu, feeling a pleasant feeling, knows, 'I feel a pleasant feeling.' Feeling an unpleasant feeling, knows, 'I feel an unpleasant feeling.' Feeling a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling knows, 'I feel a neither unpleasant nor a pleasant feeling.' Feeling a pleasant material feeling, knows 'I feel a pleasant material feeling.'
