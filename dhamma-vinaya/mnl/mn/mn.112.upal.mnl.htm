					<p class="f4">His words should be accepted as good words and a further question should be asked.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, knowing and seeing what<br />

					of conceited measurings of me and mine<br />
					completely destroyed?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is lawful that a bhikkhu who has destroyed desires,<br />

					done what should be done,<br />
					dismissed the weight,<br />
					come to the highest good,<br />

					and is rightfully released should explain it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, earlier when I was an ignorant householder,<br />
					the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the Thus Gone One preached the Teaching and I gained faith,<br />
					with that faith I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The household life is full of difficulties,<br />
					going forth homeless is like open space.<br />
					Living in a household it is not easy to lead a holy life complete and pure without being defiled.<br />
					Shaving head and beard,<br />
					putting on yellow clothes,<br />
					why shouldn't I go forth homeless?'</p>

					<p class="f4">At some suitable time I gave up a little wealth or a large mass of wealth,<br />
					either left behind a small circle of friends,<br />
					or a large circle of friends<br />
					shaving head and beard and donning yellow clothes,<br />
					went forth as a homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone forth I became a trainer in the life of a bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">I gve up hurting living things,<br />
					throwing away stick and weapon<br />
					ashamed abode arousing compassion for all beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstaining from taking what is not given,<br />
					desired the given,<br />
					made my mind pure,<br />
					without theft<br />
					I abode abstaining from low sexual intercourse led the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstaining from telling lies<br />
					became reliable and trustworthy<br />
					and abode without a dispute with the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gave up slandering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it here did not say it elsewhere,<br />
					to split these.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing elsewhere did not say it here to split those.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I united the split, promoted unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fond of unity spoke words to unite.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gave up rough talk,<br />
					saying pleasing words that went straight to the heart of all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from frivolous talk saying appropriate, truthful and meaningful words,<br />
					in accordance with the Teaching and Discipline,<br />
					words that could be treasured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from destroying seed groups and vegetable groups.</p>

					<p class="f4">Partaking one meal a day,<br />
					abstained from food at night and at untimely hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from dance, singing, music, decorations, flowers and scents, annointments and adornments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from high and stately beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from accepting gold and silver,<br />
					uncooked rice and uncooked flesh.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from accepting women and girls,<br />
					slaves, men or women.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from accepting goats and cows,<br />
					fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses and mares.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from accepting fields and wealth,<br />
					and doing the work of a messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from buying and selling and unfair ways of weighing and measuring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstained from cutting severing,<br />
					destroying and highway robbery,<br />
					and wrong ways of gaining food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Satisfied, covering the body with robes,<br />
					and feeding the belly with morsel food,<br />
					went with all the belongings wherever I went.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like the birds small and large that go with the weight of their wings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise satisfied covering the body with robes and feeding the belly with morsels I went with all my belongings wherever I went.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with this mass of virtues,<br />
					I experienced the pleasure of blamelessness internally.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing a form with the eye,<br />
					I did not take the sign or the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">To one abiding with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled,<br />
					demerit of covetousness and displeasure may trickle.</p>

					<p class="f4">I abode protecting the mental faculty of the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br />
					Cognizing a smell,<br />
					..... tasting,<br />
					re. cognizing touches with the body,<br />
					re ... . Cognizing an idea with the mind,<br />
					did not take the sign or the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">To one abiding with the mental faculty of the mind not controlled,<br />
					demerit of covetousness and displeasure may trickle.</p>

					<p class="f4">I abode protecting the mental faculty of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with the noble ones' control of the mental faculties,<br />
					I experienced the untouched pleasure of the mental faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going forward or returning I became aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Looking on, or looking aside I became aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bending or stretching,<br />
					bearing the bowl and three robes,<br />
					tasting,<br />
					drinking,<br />
					eating and enjoying I became aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going,<br />
					standing,<br />
					sitting,<br />
					lying,<br />
					if awake,<br />
					and keeping silence,<br />
					I became aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed, with the mass of virtues,<br />
					the control of the mental faculties,<br />
					right mindfulness of the noble ones,<br />
					I abode in a secluded dwelling,<br />
					such as a forest,<br />
					the root of a tree,<br />
					a mountain grotto,<br />
					a cave,<br />
					a charnel ground,<br />
					a jungle forest,<br />
					an open space,<br />
					or a heap of straw.</p>

					<p class="f4">After the meal and returning from the alms round,<br />
					I sat legs crossed,<br />
					the body placed straight<br />
					and mindfulness established in front.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispelling covetousness for the world I abode freeing the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispelling anger I abode with a mind free of anger,<br />
					compassionate to all born.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispelling sloth and torpor abode,<br />
					aware of a perception of light,<br />
					mindful of cleaning sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispelling restlessness and worry<br />
					abode with a mind internally appeased,<br />
					cleaning the mind of restlessness and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abode with doubts dispelled of merit that should and should not be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dispelled the five hindrances of the mind,<br />
					and wisely making the minor defilements weak,<br />
					secluded the mind from sensual thoughts and demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">With thoughts and thought processes<br />
					and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion<br />
					abode in the first <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again overcoming thoughts and thought processes,<br />
					the mind internally appeased,<br />
					in a single point,<br />
					with joy and pleasantness born of concentration<br />
					I abode in the second <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, with equanimity to joy and detachment<br />
					and aware of experiencing pleasantness with the body too,<br />
					abode in the third <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble ones say this is abiding in pleasanatness,<br />
					mindful of equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness<br />
					and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure,<br />
					mindfulness purified with equanimity<br />
					I abode in the fourth <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind was concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements,<br />
					malleable workable not disturbed,<br />
					I directed the mind for the destruction of desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knew this is unpleasant,<br />
					this is its arising,<br />
					this its cessation,<br />
					and this the path to the cessation of unpleasantness<br />
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knew the desires,<br />
					their rising,<br />
					their cessation<br />
					and the path to their cessation as it really was.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind that knew and saw thus<br />
					was released from sensual desires,<br />
					from desires 'to be'<br />
					and from ignorant desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">When released, I knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I'm released,<br />
					birth is destroyed,<br />
					the holy life is lived,<br />
					what should be done is done.<br />
					There's nothing more to wish.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend, knowing and seeing this sixfold conscious body and all external signs in this manner,<br />
					I completely destroyed the latent tendencies of conceited measurings of me and mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, his words should be accepted as good words and he should be told.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, it is great gain, that we meet co-associates like you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Seeing matter is weak, my interest waned and dissatisfied, I destroyed, ceased, gave up and released my mind from the latent tendencies of falling for and firmly holding matter (<i>rūpaɱ kho ahaɱ āvuso, abalaɱ. virāgaɱ anassāsikaɱ viditvā ye rūpe upāyupādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesanānusayā, tesaɱ khayā virāgā nirodhā cāgā paṭinissaggā vimuttaɱ me cittaɱ ti pajānāmi</i>). Holding matter, is something done with the mind. It is the mind's follow up with interest and greed. So too with the other four masses of feelings, perceptions, determinations and consciusness. Thus it is the follow up with interest and greed for these five masses that have to be destroyed, ceased, given up and thus the mind should be released.</p>
