					<p class="f4">Not intoxicated nor negligent on account of the endowment of knowledges and vision would take upon himself to attain the timeless release of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the bhikhu should fall from the timeless release of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like a man in need of heartwood wandering in search of heartwood, coming to a standing tree with heartwood would cut the heartwood and carry it away knowing it is heartwood.</p>

					<p class="f4">So then, bhikkhus, the holy life is led not for, gain, honour and fame, not for the endowment of virtues, not for the endowment of concentration, not for the endowment of knowledges and vision. Bhikkhus, it is for the unshakeable release of mind that is the essence and end of the holy life, .</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Intoxicated and negligent on account of the endowment of concentration abides in unpleasantness. 'so tāya samādhisampadāya majjati pamajjati pamādaɱ āpajjati pamatto samāno dhukkhaɱ vihara' ti.We see the bhikkhu abiding in unpleasantness on several occasions when he is intoxicated and negligent over his gain honour and fame, attainment of virtues, attainment of concentration, attainment of knowledges and vision. The person who has realised the timeless release of mind only does not abide in unpleasānatness. The lessening of unpleasantness starts with the attainment of the entry into the stream of the Teaching and reaches the climax with the attainment of extinction. Arahatta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The timeless release of mind, the unshakeable release of mind. 'asamaya vimokkhaɱ ārāde' ti.'akuppācetovimut' ti. This is the attainment of extinction, when attained to it, unpleasantness is not experienced any more.</p>
