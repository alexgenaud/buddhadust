					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There is right view with desires to share merit, which matures as substratum (<i>atthi bhikkhve sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññābhāgiyā upadhivepakkā</i>). Right view that is worldly is merit, there is a possibility that the merit accurred has to be enjoyed, before extinguishng. Therefore, it is said that merit accumulates and gets mature.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The logically applied reasoning thoughts which focus attention to fix verbal determinations in the noble path mind without desires, are noble right thoughts transcending this world and they are a feature of the path (<i>yo kho bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggassa samaṇgino ariyamaggaɱ bhāvayato takko vitakko saɱkappo appanāvyappanā cetaso abhiniropanā vācā saɱkhāro ayaɱ bhikkhave sammāsaɱkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṇgo</i>). Here we see, that to whatever extent a person's thoughts are developed in the direction of the noble path, to that extent his words are developed in the direction of the noble path. i.e., he thoughtfully brings out words.</p>
