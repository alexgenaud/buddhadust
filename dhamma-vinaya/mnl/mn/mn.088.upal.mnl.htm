					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anāthapiṇḍika in Jeta's grove in Sāvatthi. Venerable Ānanda put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes entered Sāvatthi for alms. After the alms round, when the meal was over, approached the palace of Migara's mother to spend the day. At that time king Pasenadi of Kosala having ascended the elephant Ekapundarīka was going through Sāvatthi during the day. King Pasenadi of Kosala saw venerable Ānanda coming in the distance and asked the chief minister Siriwadda, 'Siriwadda, is that venerable Ānanda?' 'Great king, it is venerable Ānanda,' Then king Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain man, and said. 'Good man approach venerable Ānanda, worship him for my sake, with your head at his feet and tell him. Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala worships you with his head at your feet and said. If venerable Ānanda has no urgent work to do, would he wait a moment for king Pasenadi of Kosala, out of compassion,' He agreed, approached venerable Ānanda, worshipped, stood on a side and said, 'venerable sir king Pasenadi of Kosala worships you, with his head at your feet and says. If venerable Ānanda has no urgent work, could he wait a moment for king Pasenadi of Kosala out of compassion,' Venerable Ānanda agreed silently. The king went on the elephant's back as far as he could go and descending from the elephant, approached venerable Ānanda on foot. He worshipped venerable Ānanda and stood on a side and said. 'If venerable Ānanda has no urgent work, could he approach the bank of river Acirawathie, out of compassion. Venerable Ānanda accepted it silently, approached the bank of river Acirawathie and sat on the prepared seat. The king went on the elephant's back as far as he could go, descending from the elephant, approached venerable Ānanda on foot, worshipped him and stood on a side. Then he said. 'May venerable Ānanda, sit on the elephant rug. ''Useless, great king, I'm seated, you sit on it,' King Pasenadi of Kosala sat on the prepared seat and said. 'Venerable Ānanda, does the Blessed One practise bodily behaviour that is hostile to recluses Brahmins and the wise?' 'No, great king the Blessed One does not practise any bodily behaviour that is hostile to recluses, brahmins and the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sir Ānanda, does the Blessed One, practise verbal behaviour that is hostile to recluses, brahmins and the wise? Does the Blessed One practise mental behaviour that is hostile to recluses, brahmins and the wise?' 'No, great king the Blessed One does not practise any verbal... any mental behaviour that is hostile to recluses and brahmins and the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wonderful and surprising venerable sir, this question we could not ask and get anexplained, now venerable Ānanda has explained it to me. Venerable sir, fools who do not think and fathom their words, praise or blame others. I do not believe those words. </p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, does the Blessed One approve the acquiring of all merit?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Great king the Thus Gone One has dispelled all demerit, is endowed with merit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wonderful and surprising, I'm pleased with these words of venerable Ānanda. I'm so pleased, I would offer my jewel of an elephant to venerable Ānanda, or my jewel of a horse, or even a splendid village, we know that they are not suitable. This warm cloth was sent by kingAjātasattu, of Magadha. in a case of reeds, it's sixteen measures by length and eight measures by breadth, it is suitable, may venerable Ānanda accept it, out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Useless, great king, my three robes are complete.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, we both see, this river Acirawathie falling in torrents from the mountains and flowing flooding the banks. In like manner, venerable Ānanda will make his three robes with this warm cloth. Will distribute the earlier three robes among the co-associates in the holy life, I think. May venerable Ānanda accept this warm cloth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Ānanda accepted the warm cloth. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala said to venerable Ānanda. 'Venerable sir, we have to go now, there's much work to be done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Great king do, as you think fit,' King PasenadiofKosala got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated venerable Ānanda and went away. Soon after the king had gone, venerable Ānanda approached and worshipped the Blessed One, and sat on a side. Venerable Ānanda informed the Blessed One all the conversation that occurred between the king and himself and offered the warm cloth to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. 'Bhikkhus, it is rare and great gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala, that he approaches and associates venerable Ānanda,' The bhikkhus were pleased with the words of the Blessed One.</p>
