<meta name="description" content="The Sister Upalavanna translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 2. The Buddha describes how one who applies his mind studiously to the point is able to rid himself of disrupting influences in seven ways: by seeing them as problems; by self-control, by proper use; by patience; by avoidance; by elimination; and by awakening. Examples of each case are given." />

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus, this is called the soul view,<br />

					<p class="f4">O! Bhikkhus, the ordinary man<br />
					bound by these views<br />

					<p class="f4">He is not released from unpleasantness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then he wisely thinks,<br />
