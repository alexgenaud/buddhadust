					<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>

					<p>The topic of whether or not it is possible for a layman to attain arahantship is a subject of debate going way back. As far as I can tell the doubt begins after the compilation of the suttas; I can't find anything in the suttas to indicate that there is any reason to think that it is impossible. The selection below would indicate that it was undoubtingly possible, but there is some doubt about the authority of the passage. Anāthapiṇḍika, for one, is pretty clearly stated to have become a Non-Returner elsewhere (citation missing of course). Does this mean that the meaning of "seeing the deathless, going on to realization of the deathless" should be taken to mean the state of Non-Returner? This in turn is complicated by the definition of Arahant (as well as the other stages) as including those "on the way to attainment of ..."</p>

					<p>Why is this important? For motivation. There are a few out there I know of who are really going at this system full tilt. They live alone, don't work, are celibate or are working on celibacy, eat one meal a day or very moderately, and meditate. Like the Karate Master who, wanting to make his punch really powerful, invisions not only hitting the target, but penetrating the target, the meditator needs to be able to see that he can really attain the goal if he works at it.</p>

					<p>Personally, I think it can be done. The very weakest take on this collection of little suttas would say that there was no question that the layman was able to attain Non-Returning, meaning, in this case the sort of non-returner who attains the deathless upon death, or just after death, or in any case before taking birth in a new individuality.</p>
