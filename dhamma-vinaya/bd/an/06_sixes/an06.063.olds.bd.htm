					<p class="f4">Hunger and thirst, beggars, is that from which pain springs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is pain's variety?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, beggars, pain beyond measure<br />
					that which is trifling,<br />
					that which is slow to fade,<br />
					that which is quick to fade.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is said to be pain's variety.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is pain's outcome?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars one subject to pain,<br />
					having lost control of his mind,<br />
					goes around sorrowful,<br />
					tired,<br />
					tearful,<br />
					beating his breast,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					confused.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either that, or,<br />
					subject to pain,<br />
					having lost control of his mind,<br />
					he goes out searching around, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who knows one way ... or two ways! ... to eradicate my pain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Pain, beggars, has its outcome in bewilderment<br />
					or its outcome in searching around, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is said to be pain's outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is pain's eradication?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eradication of hunger and thirst, beggars, is the eradication of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is this very Aristocratic Eight-Dimensional High-Way that is the way to go to pain's eradication, that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">High Thesis,<br />
					High Principles,<br />
					High Talk,<br />
					High Works,<br />
					High Lifestyle,<br />
					High Self-Contro,<br />
					High Mind,<br />
					High Getting High.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, beggars, the student of the<br />
					Aristocrats knows pain in this way,<br />
					knows that from which pain springs,<br />
					knows pain's variety,<br />
					knows pain's outcome,<br />
					knows pain's eradication,<br />
					knows the way to go to pain's eradication,<br />
					then he knows this best of lives<br />
					having drawn it from the experience<br />
					of the eradication of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Become an expert on pain, beggars,<br />
					become an expert on that from which pain springs,<br />
					become an expert on pain's variety,<br />
					become an expert on pain's outcome,<br />
					become an expert on pain's eradication,<br />
					become an expert on the way to go to pain's eradication".</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what was said.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it was because of this that it was said.</p>

					<p class="f4">This then, beggars, is that curriculum in Dhamma,<br />
					that curriculum in drawing-from-sense-experience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Eradication throughout this sutta is probably not the best. What it means is eradication not of the phenomena itself, but of the experience of it by the individual.</p>
