					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Indriya-saŋvare.</i> Not, as per Hare, 'Sense-control'. In fact 'sense-control' works here, and the majority of translators translate 'indriya' in some way indicating that it means 'the faculties of the senses' (Bhk. Bodhi: 'sense-faculties'), but the term is broader than is indicated by the term 'the senses'. See: Glossology: <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm">Indriyāni.</a> The fivefold <i>saŋvara</i> (control, restraint): <i>sīla-, sati-, ñāṇa-, khanti-, viriya-, i.e.</i> by ethical culture, minding, knowledge, patience, and energy. <i>Indriyas:</i> the six senses, plesure, pain, mental ease, mental pain, detachment, faith, energy, mind, serenity, wisdom, knowing the unknown, omnicience, attaining omnicience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Indriya-saŋvara-vipannassa.</i> The insight that results from being in control of a force. In essence: 'having this force under control, I see there is no adverse consequence that can come to me as a result.' In the case of this sutta: "Having this force under control, I see there is no adverse consequence that can come to me as a result; let me apply this also to the restraint required for the development of ethical culture.
