					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dāru-k-khandha.</i> Hare has "log"; PED would have "woodpile"; Woodpile has the benefit of retaining the idea of "k-khandha" as well as not indicating a living tree, but I am going with "tree-trunk" because what I have always seen when reading this sutta is an old, dead, tree stump lay'n on it's side.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Iddhimā.</i> Hare translates "Adept", but this word has the disadvantage of being used frequently by other translators for <i>Asekha.</i> Also it doesn't convey the idea that this is not necessarily an Adept in this Dhamma alone, but one who has mastered magic powers in general.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Adhimucceyya/Adhimuccati</i> [Pass. of adhi + muc] "over-set"; The meaning in this case is the specialized one of Men of Power: to determine, not in the sense of discover, but in the sense of "fixing" in place for a time. Similar to the "resolve" used for insuring that one's stay in Jhana will last for a certain determined period of time, or that one's possessions will not come to harm by fire or water, etc., during one's time in <i>jhāna.</i> This word is necessary to use in this context because of it's accuracy. It is not that it is seen that there is earth "in" the log, or that the log "is earth"; (things are with the log, as they are with everything in this system, determined by various conditions), but that the log has the property or aspect or characteristic of earth (solidity) and at times can behave, so to speak, as though it were solid. Therefore in order to present the idea to his friends that it is possible to interact with matter in a variety of ways by mental power, Sāriputta needs to show that this is done by projecting a 'determination' onto the tree-trunk that it be possible to interact with it in accordance with certain properties for a time. While consciousness depends on <i>Nama/Rūpa,</i> it is a two-way street, and one with mental control can determine a consciousness on which <i>nama/rūpa</i> depend.<br />
					A similar idea is found in Castenada's Don Juan's use of the term "focusing on intent".<br />
					Hare translates: "An adept monk, reverend sirs, won to mind-control, can, if he wish, <b><i>view</i></b> it as earth." (but by a footnote to this term indicates his uncertainty)<br />
					The other side of this is that if this were just a matter of seeing, it would not take a Master of Power to do it. We pretty near all of us can look at a piece of wood and see solidity, liquidity (in the sap, for example), heat (by feel), and motion (in decay), it's pleasant and unpleasant qualities.</p>
					
					<p>A possibly interesting way to think of this is to compare it to the situation where one has decided to change one's view of another person from dislike to like. How does one do this? By determinedly focusing on some pleasing aspect of the person and by taking focus off the unpleasing aspects.</p>
