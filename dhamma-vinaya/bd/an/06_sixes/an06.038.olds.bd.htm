					<h4 class="c">Introduction</h4>

					<p>This sutta addresses a perception attained through meditation where the meditator perceives the nature of what he has previously believed was 'himself' and 'the world' as being an illusion — a work of the imagination made from a play of light — and comes to the conclusion that 'there is no self'.</p>

					<p>The way this is to be put following Gotama's system is: 'There is no thing there that is the self.' The Pali is <i>'Sabbe dhammā anattā.'</i> = All things not-self.</p>

					<p>The difference between the statement that there is no self and the statement that there is no thing there that is the self is that the former is a point of view, the latter is something verifiable by the observation that, by definition, existence is bound by a progression of identified shapes and consciousness, [aka: Time].</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever comes into existence comes to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever comes to an end is not under one's control and cannot therefore be called one's own or one's self.</p>

					<p class="f4">To say such an ending thing is the self would be to say, to quote Gotama: 'Myself comes to an end in myself."</p>

					<p>To describe this phenomena with a point of view is to place one's self in conflict with the opposing points of view — e.g.: there is a self; there both is and is not a self; there neither is nor is not a self — and will lead to behaviors that will in every case bring one to a bad end.</p>

					<p>Today we have groups who hold each of these positions, but the most pernicious of these views is the view that there is no self in that it leads to belief that there is no consequence for inhuman behavior ... and even more damaging, that there is no need for personal endeavor to escape the disadvantages of identifying with what is not the self.</p>

					<p>With regard to behavior and it's consequences, Gotama's system speaks of <i>kamma</i> or <i>sankhāra,</i> action and reaction, or own-making and identified-with experience.</p>

					<p>From early on, the student of Buddhism will have been told that to say things like: 'I went to the store today,' 'please pass me the salt,' 'This is my ... mine ...,' etc. is acceptable if one retains in mind that one is 'speaking conventionally.'</p>

					<p>While this is largely considered a 'mere convenience', there is nothing in Gotama's system which is insignificant. The problem with 'existence' and the coming to an end of things is precisely the subjective nature of this phenomena.</p>

					<p>The individual experiences himself and the world through the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sense-object comes into contact with a sense organ and together with consciousness is experienced as sensing as an individual.</p>

					<p>The phenomena is generated by way of a previous intent by an identified-with individuality to create experience as an individual.</p>

					<p>The problem with existence as an individual is the identification with its unpleasant aspects, such as dying, and worse the subsequent confusion leading to an endless repetition of the sequence.</p>

					<p>The solution to the problem is subjective.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the subjective individuality that has generated the desire and attachment that resulted in experience as an individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">That desire and attachment must be seen, understood, resolved and let go within the subjective experience; it ends at the level where it began.</p>

					<p>This sutta translation is important from another aspect.</p>

					<p>What I call the 'Rhys Davids/Stead' translators, those who rely primarily on the understanding presented in the Pali English Dictionary and which are all, more or less, as I have said elsewhere many times, 'editings' of the original PTS translations, all miss the magic of sutta discourse. The magic is further obscured by the use of abbreviation. The student of the system is by these two phenomena deprived of the need to slow down and visualize what is being said and done.</p>

					<p>This sutta is a typical case. The sequence of terms is a progression. The progression is of a dual nature. It can be taken in the 'conventional' way as a series of mere logical arguments; but it is also to be seen as showing the way to the solution of the problem. For this latter to become clear the meditator must sit down, visualize and understand the significance of the progression, or, if hearing the sutta face to face, it is the repetition of the formula which will induce a state where this progression is 'visible' to the mind.</p>

					<p>This is how I understand and attempt to translate this sutta and why it is important to have this new translation and to be able to relate it to the Pali.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then a certain Brahman came upon The Lucky Man and approached.<br />
					Having approached The Lucky Man he exchanged welcomes.<br />
					Having exchanged welcomes, pleasantries and reminiscences, he took a seat to one side.<br />
					Seated to one side then, the brahman said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "I, Good Gotama, state this, theorize thus, namely:</p>
