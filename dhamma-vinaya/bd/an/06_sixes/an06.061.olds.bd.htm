					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This opening is chock full of puns on the notion of circles, but there is no apparent follow up in the sutta itself, except possibly in the idea that this topic went the rounds of the elder beggars and then came around to the Bhagava and the first bhikkhu that spoke...and, of course, that it is the 'round of births' that is the subject. I do not know if at the time stitching was exclusively a matter of loops.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/kd/snp/snp.5-02.than.ati.htm">Snp 5.2</a>: Tissa-metteyya's Questions, Bhk. Thanissaro, translation. A little odd that this sutta which is included in the Suttas is based on an incident reported only in a book not included in the suttas.</p>

					<p class="in2">[Metteyya:]<br />
					Who<br />
					here in the world<br />
					is contented?<br />
					Who<br />
					has no agitations?<br />
					What thinker<br />
					knowing both sides,<br />
					doesn't adhere in between?<br />
					Whom<br />
					do you call a great person?<br />
					Who here<br />
					has gone past<br />
					the seamstress:<br />
					craving.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					[The Buddha:]<br />
					He who<br />
					in the midst of sensualities,<br />
					follows the holy life,<br />
					always mindful, craving-free;<br />
					the monk who is<br />
					— through fathoming things —<br />
					Unbound:<br />
					he has no agitations. He,<br />
					the thinker<br />
					knowing both sides,<br />
					doesn't adhere in between. He<br />
					I call a great person. He<br />
					here has gone past<br />
					the seamstress:<br />
					craving.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Majjhe mantā na lippati.</i> 'Middle manta not stuck'. This sutta, unfortunately, depends on understanding this phrase, and no one is certain of the meaning of 'manta' here.<br />
					Woodward gives us: "Who knows both ends — <i>not midst that sage is soiled:</i>" which I believe incorrectly uses the 'na' to modify 'midst' rather than 'stuck' to make the meaning out to be 'not stuck in the middle' which is also Bhk. Thanissaro's interpretation.<br />
					I believe that what is going on here is that Metteyya and the Buddha were having a debate in verse and that what Metteyya had in mind was indeed the middle, but what the Buddha said in response was a pun on that term and his use of the term middle to describe his own smooth path to the beyond ... that is, The Magga.<br />
					I believe this is also supported by the description of what this middle stood for, that is, 'the ending of contact', which is another word for Nibbāna or what it is that The Way accomplishes.</p>
