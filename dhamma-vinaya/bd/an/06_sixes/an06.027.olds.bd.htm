					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> Town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then a beggar<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> approached The Lucky Man.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached he gave salutation and took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side then, that beggar said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "How many times are there, <i>Bhante,</i> that a beggar should come to see a mind-become one?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Six, beggar, are the times that a beggar should come to see a mind-become one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well done for me, friend, would be a dissertation<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Kāma-rāga.</i> Sense-pleasure-lust. A <i>Nīvaraṇā,</i> a diversion from clear view as in something that obscures the view of one's face in a bowl of water. Simile: A pot of water mixed with lac, turmeric, blue or yellow dye. Results from: incautious attention to the pleasant feature of a thing. Cure: diverting the mind to attention to the unpleasant, insight into the ultimately painful nature of the pleasant.</p>

A <i>Nīvaraṇā.</i> Simile: A pot of water heated on the fire, boiling up and bubbling over. Results from: incautious attention to the unpleasant feature of a thing.

The corrupting influences are likened to a running sore. The sense pleasures are likened to a meatless bone, carrion attacked by vultures, a blazing torch carried against the wind, falling into a pit of glowing charcoal, a loan, having climbed a tree to enjoy the fruit while another man is chopping it down [see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p54">MN 54</a>]; its mark is the pleasure, excitement, enjoyment, and delight in experience through the senses. Existence is likened to a man wandering in a waterless desert overcome with thirst and fatigue. It occurs with the conjunction of consciousness with named-forms and is the single condition which, if eliminated, eliminates old age, sickness, suffering and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair; its marks are perception through the senses, and the presence of the thought "I am", "This is me" "This is myself", "This is mine." Blindness is likened to the man standing at the foot of a mountain disputing the view of his friend standing at the peak; a hidden thing; a man lost in the woods; beings existing in the dark unable to see visible shapes. It is the not seeing that 'this' is pain, that the origin of this pain is thirst, that the end of this pain is the end of that thirst, and that <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/method/naya_the_method.htm">the way</a> is the way to walk the walk that ends thirst; its mark is having an opinion about things; wanting to 'do' to create experience for the self. Clinging to point of view is likened to a man pierced by a poison arrow who insists on knowing the maker of the arrow and other details about the arrow before he submits to treatment for the poison. Point of view is forming an opinion from experience beyond direct observation. It generally involves the necessity to know all things at all times. To say: 'This is not myself,' is the statement of a direct observation about a thing under observation; it involves the need only to recognize the characteristic of change in that single thing; to say: 'There is no self' is the statement of an opinion formed about all things drawn from such a direct observation and is a point of view. One can state that there is no thing that is the self based on the direct observation that by the nature of existence as a phenomena occurring in and dependent on time, any thing that has come into existence is subject to time and consequently comes to an end, and that therefore all things that exist are out of one's control, and cannot because of that rightfully be called one's own, or that which belongs to the self. That is still not saying 'There is no Self' and is a statement of an observable fact, not a point of view. All behavior within existence is founded on a point of view. To extract the mind from existence by abandoning points of view, one adopts an intermediate point of view based on what is not a point of view concerning existence and non-existence, which aims at eliminating blindness, and which is not attached to issues of existence and non-existence but on observable phenomena which will lead to the abandoning of existence, that is, it directs the attention to pain and its elimination, that is, the Four Truths: 'This is Pain'; 'The origin of Pain is Thirst' the ending of Pain is the ending of that Thirst; and the Way is the way to do it. The mark of point of view is the presence of the thought "It is ... was, will be; It is not ... was not, will not be; This is the truth and all other beliefs are foolish."</p>
