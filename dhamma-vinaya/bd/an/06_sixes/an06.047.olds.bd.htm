					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>There are some significant differences of opinion concerning the meaning of a couple of terms in this sutta and this results also in a very different understanding between translators as to its meaning in general. My take is that it is a very skillfully handled answer to Sivaka's question that not only answers his question, but teaches him a <i>Dhamma</i> lesson that illustrates the answer. Bhk. Bodhi does not get his say, because his translation cannot be posted because of copyright restrictions, but his translation of key terms is cited in the footnotes to my translation.</p>

					<p>I have here suggested a significant change in the usual translation of <i>'moha'</i> as 'delusion' (Hare's 'infatuation'). I am suggesting 'confusion'. In this sutta we can see that one is supposed to be able to recognize the presence or absence of <i>'moha'</i> within ourselves. People are able to recognize when they are confused, they are not able to recognize when they are deluded or infatuated as those ideas are defined by the fact of the self being deceived.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Sandiṭṭhiko Dhammo.</i> own-seen thing. It could be 'with-seen,' or 'co-seen,' or 'con-seen,' or 'once-seen' but none of those makes sense. Hare: 'Dhamma for this life'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'The directly visible Dhamma'. The sense is clear from the way it is explained: when one knows about one's self that such and such a thing is present or absent in one, then one has <i>Sandiṭṭhiko Dhammo.</i> Since this is a question not about seeing things in general, <i>'Dhamma'</i> here means 'Teaching', or 'Form', as in the <i>'Tao'</i> or natural good form, for Buddhists, understanding and behavior according to <i>kamma.</i> Since this is a question coming from an outsider, the meaning for him is this latter, 'form', 'proper form' but Gotama steers him into seeing it in the Buddhist sense of such form as leads to liberation from pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Akālika.</i> Non-time stuff. Not bound by time. Here meaning that the knowledge is directly perceived it is not a matter of a conclusion, or a result to be experienced at a later time. But further, in the way it is here taught by Gotama, it is an instruction that does not apply simply to, say, the culture of Gotama in his Time, but is applicable to all beings from whatever cultures, at all times, in all states of consciousness. As an instruction, it does require an understanding that greed is not a good thing, which is not something that is all that clear to people here today [USA Saturday, October 04, 2014 9:16 AM], but the description of a 'to-be-seen-for-one's-self' <i>Dhamma</i> does require vision and anyone with any self-awareness can recognize that the popular expression 'Greed is good', is being made by a mind aware that it is voicing what it does not believe, what is not-<i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>-dhammaṃ.</i> 'greed- etc. practices', or 'forms of behavior leading to greed'. Hare: 'has some hold'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'state connected to'. From √<i>dha</i> to hold. But the better way to put that would be 'things held to be' which is, presumably, the idea in back of Bhk. Bodhi's translation.</p>
