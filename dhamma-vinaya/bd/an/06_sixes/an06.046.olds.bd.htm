					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>Today, as 2500 years ago, there is tension between two groups of students of the <i>Dhamma;</i> between those who specialize in <i>Dhamma</i> research and those who concentrate their practice on developing skills in <i>jhāna.</i> The tension comes primarily from not seeing the path to the goal as being a very broad and complex thing indeed; seeing one's own choice of path as being the superior or perhaps the only path to the goal. In fact attainment of the goal requires at least a bit of both specialties. <i>Jhāna</i> practice without knowledge of the theory of pain and its origin and ending and the subtle aspects of attachment to existence found in the <i>Magga,</i> is going to go off in a wrong direction; <i>Dhamma</i> research without a foundation in actual practice is going to be based on faulty logic and lead to working towards a wrong goal (e.g., activist Buddhism). We need to listen to the wise Cunda and fill ourselves with respect for both sides of the practice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Jhāyī.</i> To burn or shine. Cunning, ken, knowing. In English we miss the link between 'burning' and 'knowing'. The link between <i>'jha'</i> and 'know' [<i>γνω &gt; 'gno'</i>] is clear; the word <i>'jhāna'</i> means 'to know' ... but in a higher way than we credit to the term 'know'. Such a higher meaning is found in the term 'gnosis'. In Buddhism <i>'jhāna'</i> is a 'higher knowing,' specifically, a knowing of things as they really are. The <i>jhānas</i> are a series of stages advancing towards fully seeing things as they are such as makes clear the goal of abandoning the whole thing. The link is understood in our sense of 'burning to learn' or 'shining with brilliance'. But we do not have (at least in common usage) a good term for the activity. (In some places in the U.S. and the world, the kind of deep trance of seers is sometimes called 'shining' ... as per the movie) Brighten, enlighten, illuminate, inflame are all possibilities. <i>Jhāna</i> is now usually translated 'meditation', but that term smacks too much of thinking and reasoning where this practice moves quickly from thinking and pondering to direct perception and actively involves the letting go that results from perceiving things as they are, hence 'burning off' or 'burning up' of the unskillful. A term as alien to the ear as 'burning' is, I suggest, really better because it is closer to the actual behavior involved and reflects the term as originally heard, better than a misleading comfortably familiar term such as 'meditation,' but adopting such a term is really best left as a product arising from a group understanding: the way a group dedicated to a discipline quickly develops a specialized vocabulary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Vaṇṇa.</i> 'Colorfully'? But we have given this a bad connotation. Alternatively this could mean 'not in accordance with their rank or value'.</p>
