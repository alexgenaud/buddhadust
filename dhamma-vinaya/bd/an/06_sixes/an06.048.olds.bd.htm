					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a> revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, a brahman approached The Lucky Man and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near, he gave salutation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having given salutation,<br />
					having exchanged greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, the brahman said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A 'to-be-seen-for-one's-self' <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">A 'to-be-seen-for-one's-self' <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This, good Gotama, is what they say.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what way then, good Gotama, is there a 'to-be-seen-for-one's-self' <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					timeless,<br />
					inviting 'come, see!',<br />
					to be experienced individually through vision?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case brahman what is required is a counter-question<br />
					and you should make such response<br />
					as seems fit to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">What to you think brahman?</p>

					<p class="f4">There being lust within,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, Master Gotama, as though the turned-down were over-turned;<br />
					the lost were told the way,<br />

					so that those with eyes in their heads could see shapes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus thusly Master Gotama has shown Dhamma with not simply one exposition.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to The Lucky Man for refuge<br />

					<p class="f4">Having been given life this day,<br />
					remember me as a follower<br />
					who has taken refuge in the Venerable Gotama.</p>
