					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Sandiṭṭhiko dhammo.</i> own-seen thing. It could be 'with-seen,' or 'co-seen,' or 'con-seen,' or 'once-seen' but none of those makes sense. Hare: 'Dhamma for this life'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'The directly visible Dhamma'. The sense is clear from the way it is explained: when one knows about one's self that such and such a thing is present or absent in one, then one has <i>Sandiṭṭhiko dhammo.</i> Since this is a question not about seeing things in general, 'Dhamma' here means 'Teaching', or 'Form', as in the 'Tao' or natural good form, for Buddhists, understanding and behavior according to kamma. Since this is a question coming from an outsdier, the meaning for him is this latter, 'form', 'proper form' but Gotama stears him into seeing it in the Buddhist sense of such form as leads to liberation from pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Akālika.</i> non-time-stuff. Not bound by time. Here meaning that the knowledge is directly perceived it is not a matter of a conclusion, or a result to be experienced at a later time. But further, in the way it is here taught by Gotama, it is an instruction that does not apply simply to, say, the culture of Gotama in his Time, but is applicable to all beings from whatever cultures, at all times, in all states of consciousness. As an instruction, it does require an understanding that lust is not a good thing, which is not something that is all that clear to people here today [USA Saturday, October 04, 2014 9:16 AM], but the description of a 'to-be-seen-for-one's-self' Dhamma does require vision and anyone with any self-awareness can recognize that the popular expression 'lust is good', is being made by a mind aware that it is voicing what it does not believe, what is not-Dhamma.</p>
