					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> Town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There to the Beggars gathered round he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And <i>"Bhante!"</i> they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, beggars, six constituents of vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Instability-perception,<br />
					instability based<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> pain-perception,<br />
					pain based not-self-perception,<br />
					letting-go-perception,<br />
					dispassion-perception,<br />
					ending-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">These then, beggars, are the six constituents of vision."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The 'causative' form. But I object on general principles to the whole idea of causation. Instability does not cause pain perception. One perceives instability; using that perception of instability one, of one's self, (not 'because of', but 'one is enabled by that to'), perceives pain or maybe not.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">If instability caused pain-perception everyone would perceive pain; if pain caused not-self-perception everyone would perceive not-self. If everyone perceived not self everyone would let go of living, become dispassionate, and bring pain to an end, snap fingers everyone's an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Both Hare's and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translations suggest the meaning: "the perception that pain is inherent in that which is unstable'; 'the perception that not-self is inherent in that which is painful'. These are both statements that are consistent with <i>Dhamma,</i> but neither of them are what is being said here in this sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Hare's 'the idea of ill <i>in</i> impermanence' misleads in that the letter directs one to an intellectual understanding, not a direct perception. This is consistent with his translation of <i>'vijja'</i> as 'wisdom' and <i>'saññā'</i> as 'thought', but does not much help one attain the "perceptions" necessary to "see" a method for attaining freedom and does not accurately give the letter which should reflect the idea that the one perception is based on the other.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has 'perception of suffering <i>in</i> the impermanent' at least points to the direct perception but it too ignores the letter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The idea of the sutta is a mini-version of the <i>paṭicca-samuppāda:</i> the vision of a method for attaining utter detachment provided by the sequence of perceptions. A progression which insists on there being a relationship of dependence between the six items. Given this, that leads to this, this leads to that and this and this and this.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is not the constituents of vision are: the perception of instability, and the perception of pain in instability, and the perception of not-self in instability, and the perception of letting go, and the perception of dispassion and the idea of ending;<br />
					it is<br />
					the constituents of vision are the perception that the perception of instability leads to the perception of pain which leads to the perception of not-self, the perception of letting go, the perception of dispassion, and the perception of ending.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Its being scatter-brained versus being focused. The one way leaves one saying "OK", the other way leaves one saying "I see!"</p>
