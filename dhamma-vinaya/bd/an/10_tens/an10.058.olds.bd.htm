					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>The Buddha teaches ten important ideas by posing them as questions that might be asked of <i>bhikkhus</i> (or any Buddhist) by outsiders. There is an interesting manipulation of the term <i>'dhamma'</i> here which illustrates its dual meaning as 'thing' and 'Form' (in the sense of 'Good Form') or 'The Teaching.'</p>

					<p>This translation of <i>'Dhamma'</i> as 'Good Form' comes from the discussion of the term in <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.015.asoka.htm#pg292">Rhys David's <i>Buddhist India</i> pg 292</a> where he points to the etymological root as "identical with the Latin forma" our 'form'.</p>

					<p>This serves very well for this word where it must stand for 'thing' and is a synonym for <i>'rūpa'</i> (most often translated 'form' by me) in this sense, and also for 'the best way to do a thing', or 'Good Form'.</p>

					<p>This use for 'form' is found in Asian cultures where the idea is exactly that there is a perfectly correct and efficient way to do even the smallest things.</p>

					<p>The expression 'Doing Forms' is also used as the English translation for the term in Asian martial arts that stands for various groups of moves in practice routines.</p>

					<p>At this time the word <i>'Dhamma'</i> for Gotama's teaching is relatively well known here and it will probably stick, but there is confusion that results when the word must be used for 'things' and ... 'Good form' in general.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Paribbājakā:</i> A wanderer. I am putting into this word the idea that the reason they are wandering is that they are seeking out The Truth of things.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This sutta requires one to hear the pun between <i>'dhamma'</i> as meaning "thing" and <i>'Dhamma'</i> as meaning "teaching." The seekers are actually looking for one word as the answer to all these questions, that is, <i>"taṇhā,"</i> (thirst), the Buddha turns this into a useful lesson.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup><i>Samosara:</i> PED: <i>[saṇ+osaraṇa]</i> coming together, meeting, union, junction; Woodward: conjoined.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Pamukha:</i> PED: <i>[pa+mukha]</i> lit. "in front of the face," fore-part, first, foremost, chief, prominent; Woodward: headed by.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Uttara:</i> uttermost, outer limit; Woodward: ultimate.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Samādhi:</i> Woodward uses "concentration." I think not. This is the state experienced by those who have gotten high, where the feeling is that they are on top of it all, where meaning is in focus: from this point, all things are possible. I also think that this is the pivot point of the riddle: with the next, the memory, as the fulcrum, from here the answers require the understanding that what is being spoken of is the <i>Dhamma,</i> not just things in general — things in general are not directed at wisdom, do not have freedom at their heart, do not plunge into the deathless, or end in <i>Nibbāna.</i> So this change fits the idea of serenity being the interface between all things. See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/10_tens/an10.058.than.ati.htm#fn1">Bhikkhu Thanissaro's translation, footnote 1, paragraph 3,</a> where this view would make the situation clear.</p>
