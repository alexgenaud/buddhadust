					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> does not have titles; Woodward gives the negative form of the subject as the pattern to use for the titles; the BJT uses the positive form of the subject for the titles. Bhk. Bodhi uses the positive form of the subject as the pattern to use for the titles.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> There is no <i>nidana</i> for this group of suttas.</p>
