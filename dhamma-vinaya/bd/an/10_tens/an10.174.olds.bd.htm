<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 174. The Buddha explains that it is a consequence of acting upon lust, hatred and stupidity that there is killing, theft, sexual misconduct, lies, spite, bitter speech, idle babble, coveting ones neighbours goods, working harm and wrong view, and that to bring these things to an end it is necessary to end the intentional action (kamma) bound up in lust, hate and stupidity that brings them into being." />
