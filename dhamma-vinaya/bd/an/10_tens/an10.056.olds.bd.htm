					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>I have done this translation so that we would have here a contrast with Woodward's translation. There is an enormous difference when <i>'sannā'</i> is translated 'perception' rather than 'idea'. <i>Saññā</i> = 'one-knowing' or 'first-knowing' or 'once-knowing' = perception, not idea. The difference is that an idea is an abstract thing, tending to suggest an intellectual understanding apart from the perception of it being something connected to the self (speaking conventionally, or, rather, since these things are 'helps along the way', speaking with regard to the identification with 'this being'); here the idea is to have actually seen these things as they manifest themselves to one's self... actually seeing, or smelling, or tasting the identical repulsion one has of faeces, in some otherwise delightful food for example, or the actual feeling of world-wearyness when some ambition arises, or the conscious recognition of release (a deep sigh of relief that feels like it is a full breath) when one has finally passed the withdrawl stage connected with some habitual practice one has let go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#Sāvatthi">Sāvatthi.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There then, The Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Broke-tooth!" the beggas answered Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These ten perceptions, beggars,<br />
					which made become<br />
					made a big thing of,<br />
					have great fruit,<br />
					great advantage,<br />
					plunge into deathlessness<br />
					conclude in deathlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception of the inauspicious,<br />
					perception of death,<br />
					perception of disinclination for food,<br />
					perception of displeasure with all the world,<br />
					perception of discontinuity,<br />
					perception of the pain of discontinuity,<br />
					perception of non-self in pain,<br />
					perception of letting go,<br />
					perception of dispassion,<br />
					perception of ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">These then, beggars, are ten perceptions,<br />
					which made become<br />
					made a big thing of,<br />
					have great fruit,<br />
					great advantage,<br />
					plunge into deathlessness<br />
					conclude in deathlessness."</p>
