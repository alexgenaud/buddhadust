					<p class="f4">One time the Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding <i>"Bhante!"</i><br />
					The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As far as the Kosalān Kāsis, beggars,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Does this confine the 'Thousand-fold World' to the solar system, implying an overlap or parallel worlds of which we perceive only ours? Perception of the Thousand-fold World is described as like holding a sparkling gem in the palm of one's hand. Multiple-thousand-fold Worlds are described as like holding several such gems. So conceivably the idea was of multiple solar systems each of which was itself a thousand-fold parallel world. This is certainly something that must be seen with the clairvoyant eye and should not be made to fit into, but rather fit around our modern scientific "knowledge."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Rose-apple-peninsula, <i>Aparagoyānānaṃ, Uttara-Kurūnaṃ,</i> and <i>Pubba-videhānaṃ</i> are the four great land masses of this world. <i>Bhikkhu</i> Thanissaro translates: Rose-apple (continent - India),  Deathless Ox-cart (continent), northern Kuru (continent), eastern Videha (continent). These are difficult to fit into our map of the world, but as a guess I would make these out to be: Indo-Eur-Asia; Africa; North America and South America (not necessarily in that order).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> From here to Brahma Worlds, <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro has translated these names as follows: (heavens of the) Four Great Kings, (heavens of the) Thirty-three, (heavens of the) Hours, (heavens of the) Contented, heavens of the Devas Delighting in Creation, heavens of the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of Others, and Brahmā worlds.<br />
					Woodward: Mighty Rulers, Four-Great-Rulers; Heavens of the Thirty-three, Yama-worlds, Heavens of the Devas of Delight, Heavens of the Devas who delight in creation, those Devas who delight in others' creations, Brahma-worlds.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Kasiṇ'āyatanāni.</i> Woodward: "ranges of the devices"; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: "totality-dimensions" (this is supported by PED, but as to the meaning remains a mystery); <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: <i>kasiṇa</i> bases. What we have in the examples, is ten devices with five ranges each, where the practitioner is to master all five, so that lumping all the ranges together it is speaking of the "ranges of ten devices". What this is not is "ten ranges of the devices."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Viññāṇa-kasiṇam.</i> Woodward: intellection-device; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanisaro: consciousness-totality; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: consciousness <i>kasiṇa.</i> Here, working back from the context 'consciousness' does not serve well as a device. What this likely is, in detail, is the knowledge and insight and wisdom that arises from <i>Dhamma Vicaya,</i> <i>Dhamma</i> Research. But if <i>Dhamma</i> research is not the device, then the next most-likely candidate is some sort of perception of the Realm of Consciousness, or the characteristic (aka 'element'): 'consciousness'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Abhibh'āyatana: abhibhū + āyatana; Abhibhū:</i> from <i>abhi + bhū, cp. abhibhavati.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>'Jānāmi passāmī' ti.</i> I take this to be an exclamation "I get it!" made after the insight that one has risen above the transient, painful and not-self nature of the perceived.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The <i>Pāḷi</i> here reads <i>'a-rūpa-saññī';</i> Woodward translates 'unconscious of material quality'. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'not percipient of forms'. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro has: 'percipient of the formless'. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> footnotes "4. T.M<sub>6</sub> <i>rūpa°"</i> which doesn't help. This one is a little difficult to figure out from simple logic without having had the actual experience and I think the best course would be to follow the <i>Pāḷi.</i> But which <i>Pāḷi?</i> I have opted to follow Hardy's choice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This view is conducive to attainment of <i>Nibbāna,</i> but the person holding it is not yet Arahant and is still subject to reversals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Purification is not the highest good in this system. Here we hold that the best course is for attainment of the unshakable heart's release.
