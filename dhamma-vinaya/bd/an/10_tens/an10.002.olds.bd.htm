<meta name="description" content="Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 2. The Buddha explains why when one has established perfect ethical conduct there is no need to make an effort of will to bring forth freedom from regret, joy, enthusiasm, calm, happiness, serenity, knowing and seeing things as they are, disgust with things as they are, and knowing and seeing freedom, for these things arise naturally as a consequence of perfect ethical conduct." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammatā esā.</i> Such is Dhamma. Dhamma here neither simply 'thing' nor 'the Teaching', but analagous to the Tao or Great Spirit, or Great Mind, but not the Buddha Mind though this is what is mistaken for that.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Another case that points to 'excited' as the meaning of <i>pitī</i>. So here we see someone thinking that a distinction is needed as to the type of this <i>pitī</i>. In other words, not of the carnal variety.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Passaddhi.</i> Woodward has calm here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Woodward notes the change from optative to indicative but does not speculate as to why. I will fill the need: Look at what this sutta is saying: 'One begins by modifying and eliminating the most trouble-causing behavior by following a set of ethical values. This eliminates a barrior to deep emotional feelings of joy, that is, deep emotional feelings of remorse. Then without wasting one step we turn the mind onto what it is that we are doing and we see that we are re-forming our world for the better. OK! Enthusiasm. Beginning at the crude level of carnal lust, moving up to love and adoration, moving up to rapture; it's all Enthusiasm. And it is intensely pleasurable. This is definitely the time to throw in the zinger. When we are beginning, we hear about perfect ethical conduct and freedom from remorse and joy and Enthusiasm and the power to form with thought. So the beginner is always 'Let my body be such; let my sensations be so.' And here we are being shown the foolishness of that in the clarity of the relationship between perfect ethical behavior and the absense of remorse and all the variations one could work on that theme. We see this and we are convinced! Then the next step changes gear. It's talking about not needing to form the thought that an "I" is experiencing something. Experiencing. Is the subjective experience that "I sense pleasure!" a thought? It is a thought, and it is a thought with a trap. The trap is the "I" part. It is not that for pleasure to be sensed that no thought is needed; it is that no thought of self is needed to go along with that sensing of pleasure. Ja dig?</p>
