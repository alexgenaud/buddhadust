					<p class="f4">In Sāvaṭṭhi</p>

					<p class="f4">There Old Man Ānanda came into the presence of Bhagava.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having come into the presence of Bhagava,<br />
					he took a seat.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat,<br />
					Old Man Ānanda said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it, then, bhante,<br />
					that a bhikkhu's highgetting<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth', earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water', water-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of fire', fire-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of wind', wind-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-space' sphere-of-space-perception,<br />
					nor is there, 'of the sphere-of-consciousness' sphere-of-consciousness-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-no-thing-there' sphere-of-no-thing-there-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception' sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of this-world' this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld' afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Ānanda, it is the case<br />
					that a bhikkhu's highgetting<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth', earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water', water-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of fire', fire-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of wind', wind-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-space' sphere-of-space-perception,<br />
					nor is there, 'of the sphere-of-consciousness' sphere-of-consciousness-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-no-thing-there' sphere-of-no-thing-there-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception' sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of this-world' this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld' afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how is it so, bhante,<br />
					that a bhikkhu's highgetting<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth', earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water', water-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of fire', fire-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of wind', wind-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-space' sphere-of-space-perception,<br />
					nor is there, 'of the sphere-of-consciousness' sphere-of-consciousness-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-no-thing-there' sphere-of-no-thing-there-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception' sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of this-world' this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld' afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here Ānanda, a bhikkhu has perception thus:<br />
					'This is the resolution,<br />
					this is the conclusion,<br />
					that is:<br />
					the calming of all own-making,<br />
					the release of all that has arisen,<br />
					dispassion,<br />
					ending,<br />
					Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, Ānanda,<br />
					that a bhikkhu's highgetting<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth', earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water', water-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of fire', fire-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of wind', wind-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-space' sphere-of-space-perception,<br />
					nor is there, 'of the sphere-of-consciousness' sphere-of-consciousness-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-no-thing-there' sphere-of-no-thing-there-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception' sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of this-world' this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld' afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception."</p>
