					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Savatthi-town</a> revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anathapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there Old Man Ananda came to Old Man Sariputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having come to Old Man Sariputta<br />

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					Old Man Ananda said this<br />
					to Old Man Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it, then, friend,<br />
					that a <i>bhikkhu's</i> serenity<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth',<br />
					earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water',<br />
					water-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of fire',<br />
					fire-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of wind',<br />
					wind-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-space',<br />
					sphere-of-space-perception,<br />
					nor is there, 'of the sphere-of-consciousness',<br />
					sphere-of-consciousness-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the sphere-of-no-thing-is-had-there',<br />

					nor is there 'of this-world',<br />
					this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld',<br />
					afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Ānanda, it is the case<br />
					that a <i>bhikkhu's</i> serenity<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth',<br />
					earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water',<br />
					water-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of fire',<br />

					this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld',<br />
					afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how is it so, friend,<br />
					that a <i>bhikkhu's</i> serenity<br />
					can result in sucha state as,<br />
					neither is there 'of earth',<br />
					earth-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of water',<br />
					water-perception,<br />

					nor is there 'of this-world',<br />
					this-world-perception,<br />
					nor is there 'of the afterworld',<br />
					afterworld-perception,<br />
					and yet there is perception?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, friend Ānanda, I was living here in Sāvaṭṭhi, Blind-man's Woods<br />
					and at that time such was my serenity that<br />
					neither was there 'of earth',<br />
					earth-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of water',<br />
					water-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of fire',<br />
					fire-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of wind',<br />
					wind-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of the sphere-of-space',<br />
					sphere-of-space-perception,<br />
					nor was there, 'of the sphere-of-consciousness',<br />
					sphere-of-consciousness-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of the sphere-of-no-thing-is-had-there',<br />
					sphere-of-no-thing-is-had-there-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of the sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception',<br />
					sphere-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of this-world',<br />
					this-world-perception,<br />
					nor was there 'of the afterworld',<br />
					afterworld-perception,<br />
					but still I had perception."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, friend Sāriputta, was that perception that remained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'The end of becoming<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is <i>Nibbāna,</i><br />
					the end of becoming is <i>Nibbāna</i>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As one such perception arose,<br />
					another such perception faded away.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, friend,<br />
					as with sparks from a burning fire,<br />
					as one such spark arises,<br />
					another such spark fades away<br />
					even so, friend:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The end of becoming is <i>Nibbāna,</i><br />
					the end of becoming is <i>Nibbāna.</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">As one such perception arose,<br />
					another such perception faded away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The end of becoming is <i>Nibbāna</i><br />
					but still I had perception."</p>
