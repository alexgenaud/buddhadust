					<h4>Translator's Note:</h4>

					<p>I did a translation of this sutta so as to provide a second English translation. None of the translators have seen that little 'ti' in the <i>Pāḷi</i> which indicates that what is being said is a quotation, so they are all off track though the message is simple enough. In fairness it is no easy trick to figure out how to translate this. The utterance, and the quote, seem to come out of nowhere.</p>
