<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 116. Ajita approaches the Buddha and describes what he understands to be a sage. Gotama responds by describing that a sage in this sytem is to be understood as one who argues according to Dhamma. Gotama then enumerates ten general areas to be considered good form and which are the goal and ten which are not good form and which are not the goal." />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you not remember, beggars,<br />
