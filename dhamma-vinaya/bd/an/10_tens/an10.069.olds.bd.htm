					Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at that time a large number of beggars<br />
					after eating their meal<br />
					having returned from their beggar's rounds,<br />
					having gathered together<br />
					and taken seats in the meeting-hall<br />

					<p class="f4">There then rising up at evening time<br />
					The Lucky Man approached the meeting hall and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he sat down on the designated seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated then The Lucky Man said this to the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what was it, beggars,<br />
					that was the jist of the current talk<br />
					of this body gathered together here?</p>

					<p class="f4">What then the talk<br />

					<p class="f4">"Here, <i>Bhante,</i> after eating our meal<br />
					having returned from our beggar's rounds,<br />
					having gathered together<br />
					and taken seats in the meeting-hall<br />
					we were abiding given over to making various sorts of off-course talk,<br />
					such as of<br />
					kings and ministers of state,<br />
					robbers and thieves,<br />
					the horrors of war and battle;<br />
					talk of food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands and perfumes;<br />

					talk of those alive or of those who are departed;<br />
					talk comparing differences between this and that;<br />
					speculative talk about creation,<br />
					existence or non-existence."</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not, beggars,<br />
					reflect the form of such as you,<br />
					sons of good families,<br />
					gone from home into homelessness out of faith,<br />
					for you to live engaging in various sorts of off-course talk,<br />
					such as of<br />
					kings and ministers of state,<br />
					robbers and thieves,<br />
					the horrors of war and battle;<br />
					talk of food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands and perfumes;<br />
					talk of cities, towns, villages,<br />

					heroes and villains;<br />
					gossip at the corner,<br />
					over the back fence,<br />
					or at the well<br />
					talk of those alive or of those who are departed;<br />
					talk comparing differences between this and that;<br />
					speculative talk about creation,<br />
					existence or non-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, beggars, these ten topics of talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Talk about wanting little,<br />
					talk about contentment,<br />
					talk about impassivity,<br />
					talk about living in solitude,<br />
					talk about putting forth energy,<br />
					talk about ethical conduct,<br />
					talk about serenity,<br />
					talk about wisdom,<br />
					talk about freedom,<br />
					talk about the knowledge and vision of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, beggars, are the ten topics of talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should you, beggars,<br />
					take up taking up<br />
					only talking talk<br />
					about these ten topics of talk —<br />
					even these, the moon and sun,<br />
					so powerful,<br />
					become so great,<br />
					would you out-shine,<br />
					whatsoever the shine thereof,<br />
					not to speak of wanderers holding other positions."</p>
