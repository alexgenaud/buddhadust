					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Bāhuno approached the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached and paid respects,<br />

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side<br />
					Old Man Bāhuno said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How many things, <i>Bhante,</i> has the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Form,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />

					<p class="f4">Sense-experience, Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />
					shaken off,<br />
					so as to live with a heart made boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />
					shaken off,<br />
					so as to live with a heart made boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Own-making,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />

					<p class="f4">Consciousness,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />

					<p class="f4">Birth, Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />
					shaken off,<br />
					so as to live with a heart made boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aging, Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />
					shaken off,<br />
					so as to live with a heart made boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dying, Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />

					<p class="f4">Slime, Bāhuno, a <i>Tathāgata</i> has put away,<br />
					separated from,<br />
					shaken off,<br />
					so as to live with a heart made boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way Bāhuno,<br />
					as the blue lotus,<br />
					or the red lotus,<br />
					or the white lotus,<br />
					born in the water,<br />
					growing up in the water,<br />
					rises above the water,<br />
					stands in the water,<br />
					but is not wet by the water,<br />
					even so, Bāhuno,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Cetasā.</i> Heart. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro has 'awareness'. This is not so much an awareness as a feeling (and not so much a feeling as an absence of or freedom from feeling); a state of the heart or mind, not a function. The idea of the sutta is the condition achieved through detachment from every existing thing whatsoever. That state may be accompanied by awareness but is not awareness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/rupa.htm"><i>Rūpa.</i></a> Previously I have favored 'shape' for <i>rūpa,</i> but am switching to 'form' to free up 'form' for use as 'Dhamma' when it is to stand for 'Good Form'. see: Rhys David's <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.015.asoka.htm#pg292"><i>Buddhist India</i> pg292.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">I have, since the original translation of this sutta, switched back to 'form'. Nobody here hears <i>'Dhamma'</i> when they see form.</p>

Here this means consciousness as an individual. Woodward's '(persisting) consciousness' appears to be an attempt to join this to theories of self and by that explain how it may be stripped off, but there is no idea in the <i>Pāḷi</i> of 'persisting'.</p>
