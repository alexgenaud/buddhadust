					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Cetasā.</i> Heart. Bhk. Thanissaro has 'awareness'. This is not so much an awareness as a feeling (and not so much a feeling as an absense of or freedom from feeling); a state of the heart or mind, not a function. The idea of the sutta is the condition achieved through detachment from every existing thing whatsoever. That state may be accompanied by awareness but is not awareness.</p>
