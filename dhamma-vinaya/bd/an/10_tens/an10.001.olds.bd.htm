					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#Sāvatthi">Sāvatthi</a>,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Old Man <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/ananda.htm">Ānanda</a> approached The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached the Potter he took a seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat Old Man Ānanda said this to <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the point, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					of skillful <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sila.htm">ethical conduct,</a><br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Freedom from remorse is the point, Ānanda,<br />
					of skillful ethical conduct,<br />
					freedom from remorse is the advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And freedom from remorse, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Freedom from remorse, Ānanda,<br />
					has joy as its point,<br />
					joy as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And joy, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Joy, Ānanda,<br />
					has <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/piti.htm">enthusiasm</a> as its point,<br />
					enthusiasm as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And enthusiasm, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enthusiasm, Ānanda,<br />
					has <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/passaddhi.htm">impassivity</a> as its point,<br />
					impassivity as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And impassivity, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impassivity, Ānanda,<br />
					has pleasure as its point,<br />
					pleasure as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And pleasure, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pleasure, Ānanda,<br />
					has <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm">serenity</a> as its point,<br />
					serenity as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And serenity, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Serenity, Ānanda,<br />
					has knowing and seeing such as exists as its point,<br />
					knowing and seeing such as exists as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Knowing and seeing such as exists, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Knowing and seeing such as exists, Ānanda,<br />
					has world weariness and dispassion as its point,<br />
					world weariness and dispassion as its advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"World weariness and dispassion, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that,<br />
					what is the advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"World weariness and dispassion, Ānanda,<br />
					has knowing and seeing freedom as its point,<br />
					knowing and seeing freedom as its advantage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus Ānanda skillful ethical conduct<br />
					has freedom from remorse as the point,<br />
					has freedom from remorse as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">freedom from remorse has joy as the point,<br />
					has joy as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">joy has enthusiasm as the point,<br />
					has enthusiasm as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">enthusiasm has impassivity as the point,<br />
					has impassivity as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">impassivity has pleasure as the point,<br />
					has pleasure as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">pleasure has serenity as the point,<br />
					has serenity as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">serenity has knowing and seeing such as exists as the point,<br />
					knowing and seeing such as exists as the advantage,</p>

					<p class="f4">knowing and seeing such as exists<br />
					has world weariness and dispassion as the point,<br />
					world weariness and dispassion as the advantage</p>

					<p class="f4">world weariness and dispassion has<br />
					knowing and seeing freedom as the point,<br />
					knowing and seeing freedom as the advantage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus Ānanda skillful ethical conduct is directly followed after by the topmost."</p>
