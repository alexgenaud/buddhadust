					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, <i>Bhagava,</i> Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, the brahman Janussoni approached <i>Bhagava</i> and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, the brahman Janussoni said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does Gotama not<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> also profess to live the Brahmā carriage?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, brahman, he who would say,<br />
					speaking highly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Complete, faultless, spotless, unblemished,<br />
					fulfilled,<br />
					clean clear through,<br />
					he carries on the Brahmā carriage",<br />
					speaking highly,<br />
					would say so of me — <br />
					for, complete, faultless, spotless, unblemished,<br />
					fulfilled,<br />
					clean clear through,<br />
					I carry the Brahmā carriage."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what then, good Gotama<br />
					is the incomplete, faulty, spotted, blemished,<br />
					Brahmā carriage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, brahman,<br />
					some shaman or brahman<br />
					professes to live the highest Brahmā carriage,<br />
					and though not going so far as to actually enter upon duplicitous coupling<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> with women,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					nevertheless enjoys being rubbed, scrubbed, bathed, and shampooed by women.</p>

					<p class="f4">He savours this,<br />
					craves this,<br />
					and becomes intoxicated by this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, then, brahman,<br />
					is an incomplete, faulty, spotted, blemished,<br />
					Brahmā carriage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, brahman, I say<br />
					this is an unclean carrying on of the Brahmā carriage,<br />
					yoked to the yoke of intercourse<br />
					not set free from birth, aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair,<br />
					not set free from pain, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brahman, deeper than that,<br />
					here some shaman or brahman<br />
					professes to live the highest Brahmā carriage,<br />
					and though not going so far as to actually enter upon duplicitous coupling with women<br />
					not going so far as to enjoy being rubbed, scrubbed, bathed, and shampooed by women,<br />
					nevertheless enjoys joking, fooling around and playing with women.</p>

					the five strands of pleasure,<br />
					nevertheless he carries on the Brahmā carriage aspiring to a deva-body, thinking:<br />
					'May I by this ethical behavior, practice, penance and Brahmā-carriage, become some god or another.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He savours this,<br />
					craves this,<br />

					<p class="f4">For so long, brahman,<br />
					as I observed of these seven yokes to intercourse,<br />
					one or another of these yokes to intercourse<br />
					not given up by myself,<br />
					I did not, brahman,<br />
					acknowledge awakening to unsurpassed high-self-awakening<br />
					in this world with its generations of gods and men,<br />
					with its shamen and brahmans,<br />
					devas, Maras, and Brahmās.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then when I, brahman,<br />

					acknowledge awakening to unsurpassed high-self-awakening<br />
					in this world with its generations of gods and men,<br />
					with its shamen and brahmans,<br />
					devas, Maras, and Brahmās.</p>

					<p class="f4">The knowing and seeing then arose in me that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unshakable is the release of my heart,<br />
					this is my final birth,<br />
					there is now no further becoming.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, the brahman Janussoni said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enchanting good Gotama!<br />
					Enchanting good Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Its as though, good Gotama,<br />
					the upside-down were set upright,<br />
					the covered-over were opened,<br />
					someone held up an oil lamp in the darkness<br />
					to show the way for the lost<br />
					saying "Those with eyes will see shapes,"<br />
					even so has Gotama<br />
					in a multiplicity of permutations<br />
					made known the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Hold it, Gotama<br />
					that I have taken refuge<br />
					and am from this day forward<br />
					for as long as life shall last<br />
					a lay follower."</p>
