					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, the brahman Janussoni approached Bhagava and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, the brahman Janussoni said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">Does Gotama not<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> also profess to live the Brahma carriage<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>?</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, brahman, he who would say,<br />
					speaking highly:<br />
					"Complete, faultless, spotless, unblemished,<br />
					fulfilled,<br />
					clean clear through,<br />
					he carries on the Brahma carriage",<br />
					speaking highly,<br />
					would say so of me — <br />
					for, complete, faultless, spotless, unblemished,<br />
					fulfilled,<br />
					clean clear through,<br />
					I carry the Brahma carriage.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But what then, good Gotama<br />
					is the incomplete, faulty, spotted, blemished,<br />
					Brahma carriage?</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Here, brahman,<br />
					some shaman or brahman<br />
					professes to live the highest Brahma carriage,<br />
					and though not going so far as to actually enter upon duplicitous coupling<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> with women,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					nevertheless enjoys being rubbed, scrubbed, bathed, and shampooed by women.</p>

					<p class="f4">He savours this,<br />
					craves this,<br />
					and becomes intoxicated by this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, then, brahman,<br />
					is an incomplete, faulty, spotted, blemished,<br />
					Brahma carriage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, brahman, I say<br />
					this is an unclean carrying on of the Brahma carriage,<br />
					yoked to the yoke of intercourse<br />
					not set free from birth, aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair,<br />
					not set free from pain, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, the brahman Janussoni said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">Hold it, Gotama<br />
					that I have taken refuge<br />
					and am from this day forward<br />
