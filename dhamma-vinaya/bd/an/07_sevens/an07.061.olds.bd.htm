					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/hiri_and_ottappa.htm"><i>Hir'ottappe.</i></a> A contraction of the more frequent <i>Hiri ca ottappañ ca</i> which makes awkward the usual translation 'sense of shame and fear of blame' or Bhk. Bodhi's 'moral shame and moral dread'. Shame stands alone well enough for 'sense of shame', but what do we have for fear of blame such that we could make a single word of the both? Shame-blame-aversion? I think this needs to be rethought as just the fact that there is 'shame' and there is 'blame' in the world being sufficient basis for self control. We are adding to the terms 'the sense of' or 'the fear of' without real justification in the words themselves.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Vipanna.</i> I would like to have found one word for this. Failure works for the simile: 'failure to leaf and branch' but not for a person failing to develop shame. Hare's 'lack' and Bhk. Bodhi's 'deficient in' work for both but miss the idea that it is a matter of failure to develop, not just the non-existence of the things that is the lesson.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Hatūpaniso. Hata + Upanisā.</i> Hata = destroy. UPA = up-passed; NI = down; to set up by setting down on. So 'destroy the basis of'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>Indriyani.</i></a> Usually translated 'Faculties' or 'Sense Faculties' or 'controlling faculties' or just 'the senses'; it indicates the senses but also much more such as: faith, energy, mind, serenity, wisdom, knowing, and omniscience — so: forces, or energy flows, hence 'Indra'. PED: "belonging to Indra"; nt. strength, might, but in specific Pali sense "belonging to the ruler", i.e. governing, ruling, nt. governing, ruling or controlling principle. A. on term: Indriya is one of the most comprehensive and important categories of Buddhist psychological philosophy and ethics, meaning "controlling principle, directive force,</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Yathābhūta-.</i> Others including myself have usually translated as 'things as they really are', but <i>bhūta</i> is not 'things', it is 'living' things; <i>Yathābhūta:</i> Such is life. 'As it really is' which is again the usual rendering, may be going farther than is the intended scope. The point is not to see life as it 'really is' but to see it's essence (which is not it's entire reality) as pain, which is to see it 'such as it is'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Nibbidā.</i> Literally 'down-out-knowing'. World-weariness. Tired of knowing.</p>
