					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhavaga, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There a certain beggar drew near Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat he said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now how then, Bhante, does doubt not come to the well-read student of the Aristocrats<br />
					regarding what is not made explicit?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p2" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/07_sevens/an07.051.pali.bd.htm#p2">2</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/07_sevens/an07.051.hare.pts.htm#p2">pts</a>]</span> It is as a result of view-eradication, beggar,<br />
					that doubt regarding what is not made explicit<br />
					does not come to the well-read student of the Aristocrats.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Thathatgothat has an after-death"<br />
					— such, beggar, is view-gotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Thathatgothat has no after-death"<br />— such, beggar, is view-gotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Thathatgothat has and has no after-death"<br />
					— such, beggar, is view-gotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Thathatgothat neither has nor has no after-death"<br />
					— such, beggar, is view-gotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">The unread, common folk, beggar, do not apprehend view,<br />
					do not apprehend the arising of view,<br />
					do not apprehend the eradication of view,<br />
					do not apprehend the way that results in getting to the eradication of view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with such, view evolves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are not thoroughly free of birth, aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery, and<br />
					despair,<br />
					not thoroughly free from pain<br />
					Say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">The well-read, student of the Aristocrats, beggar, apprehends view,<br />
					apprehends the arising of view,<br />
					apprehends the eradication of view<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus with such, view desolves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are thoroughly free of birth, aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery, and<br />
					despair,<br />
					thoroughly free from pain<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus apprehending, beggar, the well-read student of the Aristocrats thus sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Thathatgothat has no after-death"<br />
