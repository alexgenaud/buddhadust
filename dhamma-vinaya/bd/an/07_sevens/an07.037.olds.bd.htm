					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Catasso paṭisambhidā abhiññā. Paṭisambhidā:</i> breaking up into detail, drawing distinctions, discrimination between fine points, analysis. All this with the strong overtones of perception at a higher than ordinary level.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Four:<br />
					<i>Attha-</i> Intuitive apprehension of the point or goal or profit, or intended meaning of a thing;<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i>- Intuitive apprehension of intended meaning of a given <i>Dhamma</i> teaching;<br />
					<i>Nnirutti-</i> Intuitive apprehension of derivation of words and terms;<br />
					<i>Paṭibhāna-</i> Intuitive apprehension of precision or accuracy of understanding or the degree to which one can place confidence in such understanding. Includes the understanding of the previous three.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> 'Of a dull heart' inserted to make sense of the statement. There is an issue here as to whether or not Sāriputta would at this point be experiencing dullness of heart. This sutta may have been delivered early in his career.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>'Unbeneficial' inserted. I believe it is implied but could have been accidentally omitted. Otherwise it could be understood as incorporated into the understanding of the beneficial.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Sūpadhārita.</i> 'well worn.' The sense is of a thing that has been understood through practice.</p>
