					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhavaga, Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />
					the Lucky Man said this to the Beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are four unguardeds, beggars, of the <i>Tathāgata,</i><br />
					and three unassailables.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four unguardeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impeccable in bodily conduct, beggars, is the <i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is no foul bodily conduct of the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					which the <i>Tathāgata</i> would guard, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let this not be known beyond myself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Impeccable in verbal conduct, beggars, is the <i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is no foul verbal conduct of the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					which the <i>Tathāgata</i> would guard, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let this not be known beyond myself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Impeccable in mental conduct, beggars, is the <i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is no foul mental conduct of the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					which the <i>Tathāgata</i> would guard, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let this not be known beyond myself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Impeccable in lifestyle, beggars, is the <i>Tathāgata</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no misguided lifestyle of the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					which the <i>Tathāgata</i> would guard, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let this not be known beyond myself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four unguardeds of the <i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three unassailables?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well taught is <i>Dhamma,</i> beggars, by the <i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this,<br />
					that a shaman, or brahman, or god, or Mara, or Brahmā,<br />
					or anyone in the world<br />
					could,<br />
					according to <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					make the criticism:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just so is this <i>Dhamma</i> not well elucidated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a mark, beggars,<br />
					there is no perceiving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceiving no such mark as this, beggars,<br />
					I live having attained peace,<br />
					having attained fearlessness,<br />
					having attained self-confidence.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary, beggars, well pointed out by beggars,<br />
					is the path following which<br />
					one who listens gains <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Such a path-following listener of mine,<br />
					destroying the corrupting influences,<br />
					without corrupting influences,<br />
					liberated in heart,<br />
					liberated in wisdom,<br />
					sees for themselves,<br />
					arises in and lives,<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					in higher knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this,<br />
					that a shaman, or brahman, or god, or Mara, or Brahmā,<br />
					or anyone in the world<br />
					could,<br />
					according to <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					make the criticism:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just so is it<br />
					that not well pointed out is the path<br />
					following which one who listens gains <i>Nibbāna</i><br />
					such that such a path-following listener of the <i>Tathāgata,</i><br />
					destroying the corrupting influences,<br />
					without corrupting influences,<br />
					liberated in heart,<br />
					liberated in wisdom,<br />
					sees for themselves,<br />
					arises in and lives,<br />

					in higher knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a mark, beggars,<br />
					there is no perceiving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceiving no such mark as this, beggars,<br />
					I live having attained peace,<br />
					having attained fearlessness,<br />
					having attained self-confidence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, too, beggars, not just one hundred,<br />
					are the persons who have listened,<br />
					who have destroyed the corrupting influences,<br />
					and without corrupting influences,<br />
					liberated in heart,<br />
					liberated in wisdom,<br />
					having seen for themselves,<br />
					have arisen in and live<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					in higher knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this,<br />
					that a shaman, or brahman, or god, or Mara, or Brahmā,<br />
					or anyone in the world<br />
					could,<br />
					according to <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					make the criticism:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just so is it<br />
					that not hundreds are the persons who have listened,<br />
					who have destroyed the corrupting influences,<br />
					and without corrupting influences,<br />
					liberated in heart,<br />
					liberated in wisdom,<br />
					having seen for themselves,<br />
					have arisen in and live<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					in higher knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a mark, beggars,<br />
					there is no perceiving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceiving no such mark as this, beggars,<br />
					I live having attained peace,<br />
					having attained fearlessness,<br />
					having attained self-confidence.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three unassailables.</p>

					<p class="f4">These then, beggars are the four unguardeds<br />
					and the three unassailables."</p>
