					<p class="lgqt">This is the Paṭicca Samuppada in brief. If there is no identification with an existing being, and no idea of a thing being 'mine', there will be no identified-with coming into existence, or coming into possession of things, and as for that which now exists, or is already living, by not holding on and by letting go one dumps that and by this whole process one attains detachment.</p>

Bodhi: 'lower fetters.' PED: 'Having part in the lower, i.e., this world.' The term is to indicate that these are ties to the 'lower' or 'kama' realms, not that these are a lower set of ties although they are the first five of 10 and lower in order of difficulty. We just don't like to think of ourselves as 'the lower realms.' The five are: 1. <i>Sakkāyaditthi</i>: One Truth View (holding the view that any one way of seeing the self or any other thing is the one true way and that all other ways are false); 2. <i>Vicikiccha</i>: Doubt (about the Four Truths and kamma); 3. <i>Sīlabbata-parāmāso</i>: (holding the belief that Ethical Culture, Good Deeds, Ritual or Ceremony can bring an end to Dukkha); 4. <i>Kāmacchanda</i> (wishing for sensual pleasures); 5. <i>Vyāpādo</i> (deviance: wrath, anger, malevolance). For the full set of 10 see: <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#FundamentalAttachments">The Ten Fundamantal Attachments</a> At the time of breaking the first five one becomes a Non-returner. The various forms of non-returner described here meet their various destinies after death based on the work they need to do to rid themselves of the remaining yokes. It is interesting to note that here the things which have not wholly completely been let go does not wholly completely encompass the usual 'higher' five.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> For a full treatment of the issues relating to my choice of terms for these Non-Returners, see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.46.003.olds.bd.htm#n2">SN 46.3 n. 2</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Divasa-santatte ayo-kapāle haññamāne.</i> <i>Santatte</i> means both to heat or fire, and to suffer torment and the simile points to the lack of clear distinction between hell and this life. ... in the lower realms. I have used 'cauldren' to parallel my translation of one of the first of the many torments of Hell (see <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/bag/advantages_disadvantages/06_thehorrors1.htm">The Horrors</a>) where one is boiled in an enormous series of iron cauldrens. Cauldren seems more accommodating to the task than Bhk. Bodhi's 'bowl'. <i>Haññamāne</i> means to strike or hit or kill or murder and stands for death. We say a man has a heart-'attack' or is 'stricken' or 'sruck' to death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Papaṭikā nibbattitvā nibbāyeyya.</i> Continuing the subliminal message. <i>Papaṭikā</i> is a fragment (which has fallen off) which would generally be understood as an impurity: slag. <i>Nibbatti</i> is <i>'nis vatti'</i> or 'down-out-volution' or 'fly out and fall' but also means to be re-born; <i>Nibbaye &gt; Nibkhāyati</i> is to 'go out' as a flame goes out and stands for Nibbāna (dis-binding). The simile clearly points to a period following the death of this body which does not fall into the usual classification of 'rebirth' but which is some form of identified-with existence. Bhk. Bodhi notes this and references what is one of the clearest cases of error being made by the commentators (see my note at SN <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.46.003.olds.bd.htm#n2">5.46.3</a>). It could be a purely mental state in which one works out one's final issues, or as with the one called 'with-ownmaking' where some deeds of some sort are done with the intent to create experience and with the resulting experience (I imagine this to be something like participating in a dream and willing some situation or another, experiencing it, and that's the end of it, there is no notion of a 'whole lifetime'), or, short of being able to work things through before taking a formal new birth, birth in the <i>Akaniṭṭha</i> realm. No mention is made of the other 'Pure Abodes' which are also said to be destinations exclusively reserved for Non-returners. Since the five Gateways described here are already highly advanced states, it seems reasonable to assume that there is another grade of Non-returners who have a lot more work to do who are subject to rebirth in the 'lesser' 'Pure Abodes' and other Brahma Realms. We even hear of non-returners being reborn in the Tussita Realm, which is below the Brahma Lokas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Anupahacca talaɱ</i> and <i>upahacca talaɱ</i> This case and the next can be thought of in two ways: As his course being not the course of the spark — by identifying with the spark (as it were), his course is altered or foreshortened. Or not. So in the first case, where the spark goes out before hitting ground, his course is not foreshortened, in the next case it is. Or, as I prefer to visualize it, it is the recrudescence of 'being' that is being spoken of as being stopped short, not the length of the interval (although it amounts to the same thing). This series is in descending order, but the terms appear to me to have been constructed from the bottom up. What is stopped short is the extension of the conflagration.</p>
