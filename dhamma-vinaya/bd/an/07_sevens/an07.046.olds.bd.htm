					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>Two things in this sutta should be very interesting to the careful reader. The first is that it is a complete path to the goal using perception as its theme. The second is that each of the seven perceptions given as upward steps in this method can be made to encompass the other perceptions and are, therefore, themselves complete paths to the goal.</p>
