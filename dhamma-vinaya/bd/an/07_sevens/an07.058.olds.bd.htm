					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup><i>Disā.</i> Points [N S E W] (4), + upward and downward (6) + intermediate points (4) = 10. <i>Dasa disā.</i> The idea is to rotate the eyeballs. In modern medicine the exercise is to rotate the eyes in a clock-wise or counter-clockwise fashion. The Buddha's method would also exercise the focal mechanism and engage the mind (e.g. in figuring out where North is). But if you do it, it will be seen to be difficult to look at the 'point' that points to the region at the back of the head. Trying to figure that one out might wake one up.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Pacchāpure-saññi.</i> After-before-perception. Hare has read the whole sentence differently and understands this phrase to mean attention should be given to the ends of the place to pace. Bhk. Thanissaro has: "percipient of what lies in front and behind". One of the special advantages of using a place to pace is the way it can be used to see the arising and passing off of phenomena which is our instruction in numerous places throughout the suttas.</p>

					<p class="in2">Or he revisits body, watching over the origins of things,<br />
					or he revisits body, watching over the aging of things,<br />
					or he revisits body, watching over the origins and aging of things.<br />
					—[see: <a href="../../dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p292">dn.22</a>].</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Because of the motion one is able to take a look around and actually see the first point at which a thing appears, then as it passes past and finally disappears.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Phassa.</i> Touch. An unusual way to speak of the pleasure of sleeping. Then below at <a href="#sansagga"><i>saŋsagga.</i></a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Uccāsoṇḍaŋ paggahetvā.</i> Hare translates: 'lifted up with pride' reading <i>soṇḍa</i> as 'spirit, high-spirited'. Bhk. Thanissaro reads it as 'trunk', the raised trunk of the elephant: pride, but of course the raised trunk of the elephant does not symbolize pride to the elephant, but another thing altogether. At this point the Buddha seems to be directing his advice at the causes of sleepiness.<br />
					Snooty. Drunk with Pride. Stuck-up. He's so stuck up he needs an umbrella in the shower just to keep from drowning. This could also mean just high spirited where such a state could lead to being upset by being ignored.</p>
