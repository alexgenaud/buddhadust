					lying down on the right side,<br />

					<p class="f4">And at re-awakening, Moggallāna<br />

					<p class="f4">'Not with my pride on display<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					will I draw near to families.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the way, Moggallana, you should train yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Moggallāna, a beggar drawing near to families<br />
					with his pride on display<br />
					— there are in families many chores,<br />
					and men may not notice the arrival of a <i>bhikkhu</i> —<br />
					might have the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who now, then, goes among the families spreading disruption,<br />
					making men to show me disrespect?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, getting nothing,<br />
					there is becoming upset.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being upset there is becoming disturbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being disturbed, there is loosing self-control.</p>

					<p class="f4">Loosing self-control,<br />
					far is one<br />
					from being high in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Additionally, Moggallāna,<br />
					train yourself this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No argumentative speech shall I speak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even in this way, Moggallāna<br />
					should you train yourself.</p>

					<p class="f4">With argumentative speech, Moggallāna,<br />
					there is much contentious talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">With much such talk,<br />
					there is becoming upset.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being upset there is becoming disturbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being disturbed, there is loosing self-control.</p>

					<p class="f4">Loosing self-control,<br />
					far is one<br />
					from being high in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not, Moggallāna, speak highly of all <a id="sansagga">conjunction</a><br />
					nor, Moggallāna, do I speak highly of letting go of all conjunction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of conjunction with groups and wanderers, Moggallāna,<br />
					I do not speak highly.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that bed-seat place<br />
					which has little noise,<br />
					little shouting,<br />
					is unpopulated,<br />
					a man's sleep-alone bed,<br />
					an adequate retreat,<br />
					of such-suitable bed-seats<br />
					I do speak highly."</p>

					Old Man Mahā Moggallāno said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In brief then, <i>bhante,</i><br />
					to what extent has a beggar<br />
					freedom from own-made thirst,<br />
					reached a basis for the finish,<br />
					reached the end of yokes,<br />
					reached the conclusion of the best of lives,<br />
					reached the end of the end,<br />
					best of gods and men?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, Moggallāna, a beggar has heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All things are inadequate refuges.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Moggallāna, a <i>bhikkhu</i> has heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All things are inadequate refuges',<br />
					he knows all things,<br />
					he understands all things,<br />
					comprehends all things,<br />
					apprehends all things,<br />
					and whatsoever sense-experiences he experiences,<br />
					whether pleasant or painful or neither painful nor pleasant<br />
					he lives observing their changing,<br />
					he lives observing dispassion for them,<br />
					he lives observing their ending,<br />
					he lives observing their thorough abandonment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living observing change,<br />
					living observing dispassion,<br />
					living observing ending,<br />
					living observing thorough abandonment,<br />
					he is bound up in nothing at all in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not bound up, he wants not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not wanting, he,<br />
					of himself,<br />
					has become all-round-extinguished<br />
					and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Left behind is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more it'n-n-at'n' for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is to this extent, Moggallāna,<br />
					that a beggar<br />
					has got freedom from own-made thirst,<br />
					reached a basis for the finish,<br />
					reached the end of yokes,<br />
					reached the conclusion of the best of lives,<br />
					reached the end of the end,<br />
					best of gods and men."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup><i>Disā.</i> Points [N S E W] (4), + upward and downward (6) + intermediate points (4) = 10. <i>Dasa disā.</i> The idea is to rotate the eyeballs. In modern medicine the exercise is to rotate the eyes in a clock-wise or counter-clockwise fashion. The Buddha's method would also exercise the focal mechanism and engage the mind (e.g. in figuring out where North is). But if you do it, it will be seen to be difficult to look at the 'point' that points to the region at the back of the head. Trying to figure that one out might wake one up.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Pacchāpure-saññi.</i> After-before-perception. Hare has read the whole sentence differently and understands this phrase to mean attention should be given to the ends of the place to pace. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro has: "percipient of what lies in front and behind". One of the special advantages of using a place to pace is the way it can be used to see the arising and passing off of phenomena which is our instruction in numerous places throughout the suttas.</p>

					<p class="in2">Or he revisits body, watching over the origins of things,<br />
					or he revisits body, watching over the aging of things,<br />
					or he revisits body, watching over the origins and aging of things.<br />
					—[see: <a href="../../dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p292">dn.22</a>].</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Because of the motion one is able to take a look around and actually see the first point at which a thing appears, then as it passes past and finally disappears.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Phassa.</i> Touch. An unusual way to speak of the pleasure of sleeping. Then below at <a href="#sansagga"><i>saṇsagga.</i></a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Uccāsoṇḍaṇ paggahetvā.</i> Hare translates: 'lifted up with pride' reading <i>soṇḍa</i> as 'spirit, high-spirited'. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro reads it as 'trunk', the raised trunk of the elephant: pride, but of course the raised trunk of the elephant does not symbolize pride to the elephant, but another thing altogether. At this point the Buddha seems to be directing his advice at the causes of sleepiness.<br />
					Snooty. Drunk with Pride. Stuck-up. He's so stuck up he needs an umbrella in the shower just to keep from drowning. This could also mean just high spirited where such a state could lead to being upset by being ignored.</p>
