					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Old Man, Ānanda, Vesali-town revisiting,<br />
					Great Woods,<br />
					The Chamber of the Pinicaled Ceiling.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, he drew near to The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near,<br />
					giving greeting,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then<br />
					the Lucky Man said this<br />
					to Old Man, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are then, Ānanda,<br />
					all ethical practices,<br />
					lifestyles,<br />
					holy persuits<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					practiced with dilligence<br />
					fruitful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But there is not in this case, bhante,<br />
					only one outcome."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then Ānanda, divide this into parts."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is, bhante,<br />
					ethical practice,<br />
					lifestyle,<br />
					holy persuit<br />
					practiced with dilligence<br />
					where hollow<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> things increase<br />
					solid things dwindle away<br />
					then such ethical practice,<br />
					lifestyle,<br />
					holy persuit<br />
					practiced with dilligence<br />
					is fruitless.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But when there is, bhante,<br />
					ethical practice,<br />
					lifestyle,<br />
					holy persuit<br />
					practiced with dilligence<br />
					where hollow things dwindle away<br />
					solid things increase<br />
					then such ethical practice,<br />
					lifestyle,<br />
					holy persuit<br />
					practiced with dilligence<br />
					is fruitful."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Master approved<br />
					this saying of Old Man Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Ānanda<br />
					thinking: "the Master approves,"<br />
					rose up<br />
					and keeping the Lucky Man to his right<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					took his leave,<br />
					giving salutation.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, the Lucky Man,<br />
					not long after Old Man Ānanda took leave,<br />
					said this to the beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A seeker, Begggars, is Ānanda<br />
					but it is not easy to come up with<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> his equal<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> in wisdom."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Brahmacariya.</i> 'Brahma-carryings-on'. A term which has given translators no end of hassle. It means living the holy life according to the highest standards of Brahmā. One has 'companions in the Brahmacariya.' It is frequently translated 'celebacy' but celebacy is only one aspect of this manner of living. Being able to say, at the end, that one has 'lived the Brahmacariya' is one of the knowledges of the Arahant. In this case the idea is that one has lived the life of the God <i>Brahmā</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>akusalā</i> and in the next <i>kusalā.</i> Usually translated 'unskillful and skillful', I have taken this to <i>kucchita</i> and then to <i>kucchi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This must be understood, (so I believe) as meaning 'of pleasant, or positive, or beneficial "fruit"; not 'no fruit', for surely poorly conceived and practiced behavior has fruit ... just not of the desirable sort. Or perhaps we are to understand 'fruit' in the strict sense of that which directly results from one's intentions. So in the case of poor behavior done with the intent to create positive results, there is no [<i>such</i>] fruit.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Abhivādetvā padakkhiṇaɱ katvā pakkāmi</i> Not precisely circumambulating (per Bhk. Thanissaro), which means going all the way around, but departing keeping one's right side towards the master (teacher, king, emperor), even to the extent of walking backwards. I am not sure if this might also mean by way of the master's right side. I have only seen this in the case of a person sitting to the master's left departing to the master's right. I do not know how this is managed when a person is sitting to the master's right. Crossing in front to depart by the master's right might be taken as offensive. Taken as it is written it would allow one sitting to the right to depart by the master's left.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Sulabharūpo.</i> Well-got-form/manifestation. ?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Samasamo.</i> Same same.</p>
