					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi-town</a> revisiting,<br />

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding <i>"Bhante!"</i><br />
					The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever fears are born, beggars,<br />
					all such are born in the fool,<br />
					not in one who is wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever attacks are born,<br />
					all such are born in the fool,<br />
					not in one who is wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever troubles are born,<br />
					all such are born in the fool,<br />
					not in one who is wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					as a fire originating in<br />
					a house thatched with<br />
					<i>naḷa</i> reeds, or<br />
					<i>tiṇa</i> reeds<br />
					burns even a well protected house<br />
					plastered top to bottom,<br />
					sheltered from the wind,<br />
					shuttered against heat,<br />
					even so, beggars,<br />
					whatever fears are born,<br />
					all such are born in the fool,<br />

					whatever attacks are born,<br />
					all such are born in the fool,<br />
					not in one who is wise<br />
					whatever troubles are born,<br />
					all such are born in the fool,<br />
					not in one who is wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is then, beggars,<br />
					the fool brings fear<br />
					the one who is wise<br />
					brings no fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fool brings attacks<br />
					the one who is wise<br />
					brings no attacks.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fool brings troubles<br />

					<p class="f4">There is no fear, beggars,<br />

Woodward: "well-rounded periods"; Bhikkhu Bodhi: "well-rounded and coherent words and phrases". The literal meaning is closer to Woodward's translation, but is incomprehensible. His "periods" here implies either "comprehensiveness" or (the same thing) "the termination of a complete thought".</p>
