					<p class="f4">There he said words to this effect:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The unread commoner, beggars, speaks of three<br />

					<p class="f4">2. There comes a time, beggars,<br />
					when a great fire rises up,<br />
					and this great fire rising up, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The terror of aging,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is not to be got, beggars,<br />
