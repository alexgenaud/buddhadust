A 'lion's roar' wherein Gotama emphatically states that he has taught the Dhamma and leads the congregation well, with logical explanations, in a way that is deep and full of wonders and that the reason he has been able to do this is because he has fully understood the truth of what he is teaching." />

					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time,</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lucky Man, Vesali District, Gotama Shrine, came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he said<br />
					to those same Beggars<br />
					who had found no satisfaction<br />
					in the Mulapariyaya Spell:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Broke-tooth" those Beggars responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars, when I teach Dhamma<br />
					I do so knowing Dhamma,<br />
					not without knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach Dhamma precisely<br />
					not imprecisely.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach Dhamma in a wondrously deep way,<br />
					not in a way that is not wondrously deep.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I teach Dhamma knowing,<br />
					not not knowning;<br />
					precisely,<br />
					not imprecisely;<br />
					in a wondrously deep way,<br />
					not in a way that is not wondrously deep<br />
					that it is as it ought to be<br />
					that it is I that am instructing,<br />
					that it is I that am advising.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case<br />
					it is the reasonable thing<br />
					that one should be pleased<br />
					and brought to higher consciousness,<br />
					mentally at ease<br />
					with the thought that<br />
					'Well taught is the Dhamma<br />
					by the #1 Wide-Awakened One;<br />
					Properly managed is the Order.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Buddha said,<br />
					and it was at this time<br />
					that those Beggars understood The Mulapariyaya Sutta<br />
					and were pleased<br />
					and were brought to higher consciousness,<br />
					and furthermore<br />
					the Thousandfold World System was shaken.</p>
