<meta name="description" content="Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 28. The Buddha characterizes three sorts of speech: The one who gives false testimony is like dung; the one who gives true testimony is like flowers; the one who having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech, speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many is like honey." />

But note no apparent conflict in the Pali with the explanation for 'honey-tongued.' I.e., the word was not considered harsh, harmful, unpleasant to the ear, disagreeable, unable to touch the heart, incourteous, or not delightful or pleasant to the ear of the common person.<br />
					This is not an easy expression to translate here. What is needed for <i>bhāṇi,</i> in terms of context is the word 'testimony'. The literal translation is simply 'speaking'. In this case 'tongued' works for all three but misses the context, 'testimony' works but is awkword in use with the descriptive adjective. In English, disregarding context, we have common phrases for all three: Foul-mouthed [jive-talk, shit-mouthed, dirty-mouthed], flowery speech, honey-tongued. In the case where 'testimony' is the context, Woodward's 'tricky-tongued', works for the first, but his 'fair-spoken' and 'honey-tongued' for the latter two do not work well.</p>
