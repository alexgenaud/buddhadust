					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>Woodward makes the distinction between 'experience' and <i>'Dhamma'</i> a matter of understanding the spirit <i>(attha)</i> and the letter <i>(Dhamma)</i> of a given dissertation.</p>

					<p><i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi footnotes [n 403]: 'Mp explains "experiences the meaning" <i>(attha-paṭisaṃvedī)</i> as "experiences with knowledge the explanation of the meaning (or commentary) ... and "experiences the <i>Dhamma</i> of the canonical text" ... However while the two terms are often paired, the precise distinction between <i>attha</i> and <i>dhamma</i> is not clearly drawn in the <i>Nikāyas.</i> ... <i>Attha</i> can signify meaning, benefit, good, and goal; <i>dhamma</i> can signify the teaching, the system of practice, the nature of things, and the truth pointed to by the teaching. Thus the contrast between <i>dhamma</i> and <i>attha</i> can be seen as that between the formulated teaching and its meaning, between the practice and its goal, and between the teaching and the benefit it brings.' ... and this does not cover all the possibilities!</p>

					<p>The translations of both <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi and Woodward put the emphasis on the evaluation of the teacher and the student against the understanding of these two terms.</p>

					<p>This translation is being made to alter the emphasis from that of self-evaluation and other evaluation against the understanding of the two terms <i>attha</i> and <i>dhamma,</i> to the idea that the basic message is that teaching should be a living experience of a real communication between two individuals, not a matter of delivering a memorized speech (however well understood, or likely to be understood) to an audience.</p>

					<p>In other words, in the best case, one should not flip between delivering a dissertation thinking that if nothing else, teaching is good because one learns one's self, or that teaching is good because someone else may learn something one has learned, but that it is the sharing of an experience of mutually understanding something <i>as the teaching is being given, in the here and now, in this seen thing.</i></p>

					<p>Then, with <i>this</i> in mind, it is necessary, before giving a talk, to evaluate one's ability to re-live the experience as one is delivering one's talk and to create this experience in the audience.</p>

					<p>This sutta relates closely to the next (if they are in fact separate suttas), where the case is the less than ideal case. So the two together would be heard as: "Ideally it is this way; it will do if it is this other way." This, at least, is how I hear it and tell it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a> residing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was there, then, that one time he said this to the beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">and the beggars responding <i>"Bhante!",</i><br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ideally,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> beggars,<br />
					there are these three objectives<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to bear in mind<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					when giving a dissertation on <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">That he who gives the dissertation on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					has the experience of the objective himself<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and<br />
					the experience of <i>Dhamma</i> himself.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That he who hears the <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					has the experience of the objective himself and<br />
					the experience of the <i>Dhamma</i> himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">That both the one who gives the dissertation on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and the one who hears the <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					have the experience of the objective for themselves and<br />
					the experience of the <i>Dhamma</i> for themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three objectives, beggars,<br />
					which properly should be born in mind<br />
					when giving a dissertation on <i>Dhamma.</i>"</p>
