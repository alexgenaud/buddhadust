					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>This is an extremely interesting sutta for anyone attempting to break into the just-above-the-beginner level of understanding this <i>Dhamma.</i> In several places throughout the suttas it is hinted that 'seeing the Four Truths, one sees the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i> seeing the <i>samuppada</i> one sees the Four Truths'. Here in this sutta the two are combined in one. I think this only happens in one other sutta. It is very important for understanding the fact that each of the major segments of the <i>Dhamma</i> are in fact just ways of re-stating the Four Truths in other terms. Understanding this will go a long way to eliminate conflicts between various practices that emphasize one or another of the multiplicity of methods put forward in the Suttas and will greatly simplify comprehension of the system as a whole.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Akiriyāya saṇṭhahantī.</i> Please not to be confused with the instruction here to practice 'intentional not-doing' which advocates strenuous conscientious effort to abstain from deeds based in lust, anger and blindness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Issara-nimmāṇa-hetu.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>A-hetu-appaccayā. Bhks.</i> Bodhi and Thanissaro: 'without a cause or condition,' Woodward: 'uncaused and unconditioned.' My preference for <i>'hetu'</i> is 'driver' over 'cause' because of the implied certainty of outcome in the term 'cause' whereas the idea is really 'driving force' where the outcome is not always certain. <i>'Paccaya'</i> is 'antecedent condition' or as with <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro often: 'requisite condition,' Sometimes also called 'economic condition'. Sometimes also called 'result' and sometimes 'condition.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Pubbe kataṃ kho pana bhikkhave sārato paccāgacchataṃ na hoti chando...</i> 'previously done then again strong attachment result-getting no having desire...' It looks as though <i>Bhks.</i> Bodhi and Thanissaro have given up trying to make sense of this and have just followed Woodward's: "Those who fall back on the former deed, past deeds, what was done in the past as the essential reason, essential truth, being essential ..." all of which pretty well convey the idea. Freely translated this might be best understood as: 'It follows then that those who strongly adhere to the doctrine of predestination formed by previous acts will generate no desire ...' My translation attempts to adhere to the literal <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> I think that this is to be heard:</p>

					      <p class="f3 in4">Thus without taking on what is true and reliable<br />
					      <i>according to Dhamma</i><br />
							concerning what is to be done and what is not to be done<br />
							it follows that there is no distinction<br />
							<i>according to Dhamma</i><br />
							between a shaman and one who lives forgetful-minded and unguarded.</p>
