					<p class="f4">There he said this to the beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Three, beggars, are men to be seen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, beggars, one man,<br />
					by entirely transcending perception of forms,<br />
					retiring perception of reaction<br />
					to diversity of perception<br />
					forming in mind the thought:<br />
					'Endless Space!'<br />
					rises up into and abides in the Sphere of Space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes satisfaction in,<br />
					sets up desire for and<br />
					indulges enjoyment thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking that stand,<br />
					obsessed with that,<br />
					living making a big thing of that,<br />
					not falling back,<br />
					having done his time,<br />
					he goes on to join those divinities<br />
					come to rebirth having gained the Sphere of Space<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					that have gained the Sphere of Space<br />
					20,000 kalpas<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> is the span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the common folk stay<br />
					for a lifetime lasting as long as<br />
					the life-span of those deities there,<br />
					and then, cast from there,<br />
					all such go to Niraya,<br />
					go to the animal womb<br />
					go to the ghostly garb.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the student of the Lucky Man stays there<br />
					for a lifetime lasting as long as<br />
					the life-span of those deities there<br />
					and then, cast from there,<br />
					all such become all-round-unbound.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars is the distinction,<br />

					the variance in this case<br />
					between the well-read student of the Aristocrats<br />
					and the unread common folk,<br />

					in the manner of their goings and rebirths.</p>
