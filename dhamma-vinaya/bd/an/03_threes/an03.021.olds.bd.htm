					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This sutta deals with three sorts of attainments: <i>Kāya-sakkhī,</i> the 'body-with-eyes' one who has seen the true nature of body with his own eyes, so at least provisionally: 'body-knower'; <i>Diṭṭha-p-patto,</i> the 'view-secured' (bowled, in-the-bowl, bagged); and <i>Saddhā-vimutto,</i> the 'faith-freed'. The Buddha makes it clear that these are modes or types of practice that have lead to stream-entry, they are not levels in a hierarchy. Any one of the three may be working for arahantship, or non-returning or once-returning. The body witness is one who has made <i>jhāna</i> practice his main focus. The view-attainer has made perception of the truth of the teachings the main focus of his practice. The faith-freed has made faith in the Buddha, <i>Dhamma,</i> and <i>Saṅgha</i> the main focus of his practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Old Man Sāriputta said this<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Old Man Sāriputta<br />

					<p class="f4">Having approached and saluted Bhagava<br />

					<p class="f4">Having taken seats to one side,<br />

					<p class="f4">As it stands, Sāriputta,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Kāya-sakkhī.</i> PED: <i>-sakkhin</i> he who has realized and gained the final truth concerning the body. Woodward: One who has testified to the truth with body.<br />
					According to "Designation of Human Types," [DHT] pp6 n.3: "There are six cases of <i>kāya-sakkhī</i>" The list of six goes from one who meditates on the first <i>jhāna</i> through to one who meditates on the ending of perception and sensation. Before the list is given it is explained that the term implies Stream-entry. So the idea is one who has attained Stream-entry by way of the <i>jhānas</i> or by perception of the ending of perception and sensation.<br />
					PED: <i>Sakkhi</i><sup>1</sup> [<i>sa</i><sup>3</sup> + <i>akkhin;</i> cp. Sanskrit <i>sāks.in</i>] an eyewitness D II.237 (nom. sg. <i>sakkhī</i> = with his own eyes, as an eyewitness); Sn 479, 921, 934 (<i>sakkhi dhammaṃ adassi,</i> where the corresponding Sanskrit form would be <i>sākād</i>); J I.74. - <i>kāya-sakkhī</i> a bodily witness, <i>i.e.</i> one who has bodily experienced <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimokkha.htm">the 8 <i>vimokkhas</i></a> A IV.451; Vism 93, 387, 659. - <i>sakkhiṃ karoti [Sanskrit sākṣī karoti]</i> (1) to see with one's own eyes S II.255;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Diṭṭhi-p-patto.</i> [DHT]: "According to the Commentary, he who thoroughly knows that this is suffering, this is the cause of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering, is one who has won vision.<br />
					This is Stream-entry.<br />
					I think there may be an error here. The distinction is between <i>diṭṭhi</i> and <i>diṭṭha.</i> When one has adopted <i>'sammā diṭṭhi'</i> as a working hypothesis, the goal is to see it at work as it actually is, which is <i>diṭṭha.</i> "Thoroughly" knowing would imply <i>"dittha"</i> which the context would show was not what was intended. I cannot tell if it was myself or BJT that previously had "dittha", but PTS and CSCD both use <i>"ditthi."</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Saddhā-vimutto.</i> [DHT] does not discuss 'freed by faith,' although it is listed; it does discuss <i>'saddh-ā-nusārī',</i> one conforming by faith: It applies to one who has reached the first state of sanctification, [stream-entry] because he moves by <i>saddhā</i> or faith.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> This is one of a very few times in the suttas where the conversation was not actually repeated in full or indicated by <i>"... pe ..."</i> that it should be repeated in full.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The key to this sutta is, of course, in the response of the Lucky Man, that is, that these are three different types of persons on the Path (or, of ways or modes of traveling the Path) as opposed to being three different stages of attainment.</p>
