					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>First off, <i>sankhata</i> means that which is 'own-made,' or 'constructed,' or 'confounded' or 'fabricated' (Bhk. Thanissaro has it correctly, though it would be preferable to see the 'con' there, and even moreso the personal attribute implied by own-making), not, (in spite of Bhk. Bodhi, Rhys Davids, Woodward, PED <i>et al</i>) 'conditioned.' <i>saŋ</i> = con or with or own; <i>khata</i> = <i>khara</i> = made. That which is constructed is conditioned, but not everything that is conditioned is constructed! To use 'conditioned' for <i>'sankhata'</i> is to skip over a step. And at another point the distinction is essential. See: <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna conditioned?</a></p>

					<p>But the point here is: Is this sutta about the nature of the characteristics or is it about the nature of the constructed?</p>

					<p>The interpretation of this sutta depends on one's interpretation of the phrase '<i>saŋkhatassa saŋkhata-lakkhaṇāni</i>'</p>

					<p>Woodward: 'condition-marks of that which is conditioned'.</p>

					<p>Bhk. Bodhi notes that the passage is literally (excepting the objection to the use of 'conditioned for constructed) <i>'contitioned-characteristics of the conditined'</i> and then translates <i>'characteristics that define the conditioned'</i> stating that he has done so <i>'to avoid giving the wrong impression that the characteristics themselves are conditioned or unconditioned.'</i> But these characteristics <i>are</i> <i>saŋkhata</i> that is, constructed' and certainly they are 'conditioned': a characteristic of a thing depends on (is conditioned by) the existence of the thing itself.</p>

					<p>These characteristics of existing things are built into, constructed with, the thing itself, are aspects of it's nature.</p>

					<p>That which comes to be (i.e., that which is made, own-made, constructed, <i>saŋkhata</i>ed) is subject to time and has a beginning, middle and end.</p>

					<p>Making something become (<i>sankhāra</i>ing) is the simultaneous making of such characteristics as becoming, aging and alteration. The characteristics themselves are constructed. Turn it upside down: without these characteristics there would be no animate life, it is as essential to the construction of a thing in existence that it have these characteristics as it is to build in strength in the foundation of a house.</p>

					<p>An insidental clue here is that the construction is arising, aging and difference while standing which is consistent with the usual ordering of time: past, future, present.</p>

					<p>Now then, what is the importance of understanding this as a sutta pointing to the nature of the characteristics of things that are own-made? Precisely the idea that these characteristics are constructed along with own-making and do not accompany that which is not own-made.</p>

					<p>If while conjuring some future pleasure one can note that one is also imagining it's beginning, aging and alteration while on-going, one has one more tool to abort that conjuration.</p>

					<p>That which is own-made has these characteristics.</p>
					
					<p>That which is own-made is, because of these characteristics, inherently painful.</p>
					
					<p>Not all things are own-made.</p>

					<p>Who hears by wisdom's knowing?</p>
