Bodhi here "fail", Woodward 'Warped' and 'askew' with a footnote explaining.' I suggest what we have here in this sutta is the basic intended meaning as it would be understood throughout the world wherever there is construction using wood, that is as Woodward has it, "warped". I suggest the derivation is: <i>via apada;</i> via the not-path. For the behavior and mental state: deviance, for the opposite: not-warped or straight.</p>
