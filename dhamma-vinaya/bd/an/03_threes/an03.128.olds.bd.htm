					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man, Baranasi-town revisiting, Isipatana, Deer Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Ancient Anuruddha approached the Ancient Sāriputta and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near the Ancient Sāriputta he gave friendly greeting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having given friendly greetings and exchanged polite conversation, he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then the Ancient Anuruddha said this to the Ancient Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here friend Sāriputta<br />
					the divine eye is purified beyond the ken of ordinary men: —<br />
					I overlook worlds a-thousand;</p>

					<p class="f4">And then further,<br />
					undertaken by me is energy unsluggish;<br />
					set up is memory unconfused;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passified in body<br />
					at peace<br />
					composed<br />
					at one with the heart;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But still there is no absolute<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> freedom of heart from the corrupting influences."</p>

					<p class="f4">[Sāriputta:]</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "This being as you say then friend Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I with the divine eye purified beyond the ken of ordinary men: —<br />
					overlook worlds a-thousand';<br />
					this is 'pride';</p>

					<p class="f4">This being just as you say friend Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Undertaken by me is energy unsluggish;<br />
					set up is memory unconfused;'<br />
					this is 'excitement';</p>

					<p class="f4">This being just as you say friend Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But still there is no absolute freedom of heart from the corrupting influences;'<br />
					this is 'worry'.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well it would be for you, friend Anuruddha,<br />
					to let go of these three things,<br />
					not look for the solution in<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> these three things,<br />
					taking up in heart the characteristics of the deathless."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. There then the Ancient Anuruddha,<br />
					wasted no time letting go these three things,<br />
					not looking for the solution in these three things,<br />
					took up in heart the characteristics of the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Ancient Anuruddho<br />
					alone by himself,<br />
					careful,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					living persistent,<br />
					not long thereafter attained and entered into<br />
					that unsurpassed conclusion of the godly life<br />
					even young sons of the best houses<br />
					leave home venturing to find<br />
					and he knew for himself<br />
					in this seen thing<br />
					as an eye-witness that:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Left behind is birth,<br />
					lived is carrying on like God,<br />
					duty's doing's done,<br />
					no further it'n-at'n me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Ancient Anuruddha too became one of the Arahants.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Cittaɱ ekaggaɱ.</i> Usually translated: 'at one point', e.g., Woodward, Bhk. Bodhi. Here this is being taken to mean an aspect of the necessity to get body and mind in alignment in order to attain freedom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Na anupādāya āsavehi cittaɱ vumuccatī.</i> No non-support [for] corrupting-influences heart freedom. Woodward: 'heart not released from the āsavas without grasping'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'mind not liberated from the taints through non-clinging'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>mānasmiɱ, uddhaccasmiɱ, kukkuccasmiɱ,</i> in Sariptuta's analysis of Anuruddha's three statements. These are two of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>saŋyojanas</i></a> binding one to the higher births that need to be eliminated to attain arahantship here and now. This sutta is being cast by Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi as a sort of rebuke or taking down of Anuruddha where here it is being taken as his seeing and pointing out what is being overlooked: the subtle form which these 'fetters' are taking in Anuruddha. Neither Woodward nor Bhk. Bodhi associate this with the <i>saŋyojanas.</i><br />
					Woodward: conceit, arrogance, worrying; Bhk. Bodhi: conceit, restlessness, remorse. Note that 'conceit' is the term often used to describe the idea 'I am'. This is what is being missed by Anuruddha to this point, that his attachment to his skills are his manifestation of self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Amanasikaritvā</i> not study in mind, in this method the effort being to trace to their origin [yoniso-] the source of problems. The understanding here being that Anuruddha is speaking of this to Sāriputta in an effort to uncover the error in his method that is causing him his lack of success. Sāriputta is instructing him that he is looking in the wrong places.</p>
