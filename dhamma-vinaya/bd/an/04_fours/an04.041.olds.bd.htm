					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārāya.</i> Woodward translated 'in this very life'; Thanissaro: 'in the here and now.' Literally: Seen-thing-sweet-abiding. The problem with 'here and now' is the difficulty of locating that point when sense experience occurs subsequent to contact of sense organ with sense object. What the early beatnicks called 'the lag.' Translating more literally puts the focus on the experienced.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Ñāṇadassanapaṭilābhāya.</i> Book knowledge that has been actualized (reafied). In the Dhamma specificially it is the having seen as true the working hypothesis set up by the Four Truths. The first stage of secure accomplishment in the system, named 'Stream-entry'; however long it takes, the streamwinner will inevitably arrive at liberation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Āsavā.</i> Anything which results in good conditions decreasing and bad conditions increasing. At the most general level: lust, anger and blindness, with blindness specifically to the truth of the Four Truths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5a" href="#fn5a">5a</a>]</sup> <i>Vūpasama.</i> <i>Jhāna.</i> Literally 'burning brite' or 'shining' &gt; intelligence to Chinese 'Chan', Japanese 'Zen', English "Knowing", but best yet the Old English term 'ken', here meaning to grasp the meaning of a thing primarily through the mind's eye by way of the physical eyes. When 'this visible thing' aligns up with what is seen by the mind's eye without wavering, it's 'seen' 'ken' as true or understood in terms of it's cosmic significance, it's trueness as a metaphore for life or the wisdom of the Dhamma, etc. I really like the resonance with 'jhana' 'chan' 'zen' ken?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Vūpasama.</i> Settling down, not repression. What is happening here is that the thinking and imagining settle down, resolve themselves into nothing like a slip-knot when it is pulled when the meditator ceases to attend to the dialog. The meditator does not take an active repressive role.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Cetaso ekodībhāva.</i> One of the continuously debated terms. Literally: heart (or mind) made one. Concentrated, single-minded, one-pointed. Thanissaro: composed; Woodward: single-minded. 'Concentrated' causes problems for those who would define samadhi as concentration. Experience tells us it is the evolution of the mind from the ordinary diffused state to one intent on the process of becoming high. It is not concentration on one thing, as the process of geting high involves alertness to this and that source of tension and distraction and the tracing back of these sources to such a point as allows their release. Concentration on a device is a training tool which is to be let go as soon as skill in becoming single-minded of purpose is mastered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Pubbeva somanassa-domanassānaɱ attha-gamā.</i>Pub'eva. Younger, too young, before eve, early, before. <i>soma</i>nassa, being filled with extacy. Doma, bad feeling. <sup>[<a id="n7a" href="#fn7a">7a</a>]</sup>"Finding their own way home" is literal, but a good way to put it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Manasi karoti.</i> Literally Mind-such making. Woodward: pays attention; Thanissaro: attends to. I think this would be more widely recognized as meditation if that word were not being used for the composite practice of sitting, minding and becoming high that is common today.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Ālokasañña.</i> Āloka, as 'light' in English, also meaning 'seeing' 'comprehending' and 'vision' (I've seen the light), and 'intuiting' or 'insight' (throwing light on the matter).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Text segues to the verses with an obvious anacronism: <i>Idañca pana me taɱ bhikkhave sandhāya bhāsitaɱ pārāyane puṇṇakapañhe.|| ||</i> Woodward translates: "Moreover, in this connexion I thus spoke in <i>The Chapter on the Goal</i> in (the sutta called) <i>The Questions of Puṇṇaka</i>" And footnotes: In <i>Pārāyana-Vagga</i> of <i>Sutta Nipāta, v.</i> 1048. The lines are also quoted at G.S. i, 116, and other verses from this ancient poem are found in the Nikāyas. See Buddhist India, <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.010.literature.htm#p1">178</a>. Bhk. Thanissaro has: "And it was in connection with this that I stated in <a id="punnaka">Punnaka</a>'s Question in the Way to the Far Shore [<a href="../../../ati/kd/snp/snp.5-03.than.ati.htm">Sn V.3</a>]:</p>
