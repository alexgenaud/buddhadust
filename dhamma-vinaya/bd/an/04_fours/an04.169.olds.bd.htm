<meta name="description" content="translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 169. The Buddha distinguishes between two sorts of persons in accordance with their path: one pair meditates on the foul and one pair uses the jhanas. Of each pair one attains extinguishment here and one hereafter. In the case of the first pair, meditating on the foul, extinguishment either here or hereafter comes after own-making (sankhara). In the case of the second pair, using the jhanas, extinguishment either here or hereafter comes without own-making." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>(sā- and a-) saŋkhāra</i> In the description of the type of person Woodward translates <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> as 'with- and without effort'; but in the list of contemplations, he translates it 'activities'. Bhk. Bodhi does a similar thing using 'exertion' and 'conditioned phenomena'. <i>'Saŋkhāra'</i> does have the dual meaning of the activity used to create personal existence and the identified-with existing thing, but the translation should make it more obvious that it is the two sides of this one idea that are being spoken of. 'Confounding' and 'the confounded' or 'fabricating' and 'the fabricated'. And it is not 'conditioned'! (see the discussion: <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/dhamma_talk/dt_009.conditioned.vs.own-made.htm">Is Nibbāna Conditioned</a>) And the idea is not just 'activity' but 'identification with the intent to create the experience of pleasure through action of thought, speech, and body; and the identified with result. It is essential to grasp this idea in order to understand how the Buddha is distinguishing the two sets of individuals. The contimplation of the unpleasant involves <i>saŋkhāra</i> (it involves personal, identified-with perceptions and thoughts and intentions and behavior), where the <i>jhānas</i> do not (or, at least they evolve towards and culminate in detachment precluding own-making).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Note not the usual <i>kāyassa bhedā parama maranā</i> 'upon the break-up of the body after death'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Āhāre paṭikkūla-saññī.</i> Usually tranlated 'repulsiveness of food' (as Woodward, Bhk. Bodhi). But the literal meaning of <i>paṭikkūla-saññī</i> is 'against- (contra- anti- retro- re-) the-slope-perception' where, I believe the real idea is that eating food is contradictory behavior relative to the goal. So 'repellant' or 'repulsive' if heard literally are not incorrect, but do not bring out the reason food is repellant. There is this experience for the one bent on serenity: even one bite beyond what is absolutely necessary to maintain the body fogs up the mind and brings discomfort to the body for a very long time, and with sharp perception disinclination to eat or to eat more can be perceived and if followed brings great benefit. This may be the meaning and it is to indicate this idea that I have made this translation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Muduttā.</i> Softly, tenderly, mildly. The word needs to have some positive connotation, for it is necessary that the forces be somewhat developed, if not strongly manifest as in the previous case.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Cetaso ekodī-bhāvaɱ.</i> 'Single-become at heart.' My latest attempt at a good translation of this much disputed phrase. </p>
