					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a> revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then <i>Bhagava</i> said this to the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Elder!" those beggars responding, the Lucky Man said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Four, Beggars, are the persons to be seen in this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">One who comprehends intuitively;<br />
					one who comprehends upon analysis;<br />
					one who comprehends after being instructed;<br />
					one who comprehends only the letter.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, beggars, are the four persons to be seen in this world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The first understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is pain" immediately upon hearing it.<br />
					The second understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is pain" upon hearing that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> includes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness.<br />
					The third understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is pain" upon hearing that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> includes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness, and that this group of terms encompasses all that which is understood to be a living, existing being, and that birth, aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair; not getting what is wished-for; getting what is not wished-for; in a word, that the entire stockpile of temptations (form, sense-experience, own-making, and consciousness) is a heap of flaming du-k-kha.<br />
					The fourth type is able only to repeat that in Buddhism what is taught is that "This is pain" and that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> is said to include form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness, and that this group of terms encompasses all that which is understood to be a living, existing being, and that birth, aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair; not getting what is wished-for; getting what is not wished-for; in a word, that the entire stockpile of temptations (form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness) is a heap of flaming du-k-kha.</p>
