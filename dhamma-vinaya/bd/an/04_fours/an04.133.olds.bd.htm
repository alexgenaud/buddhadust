					<p class="f4">There then Bhagava said this to the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">And 'Elder!' those beggars responding, the Lucky Man said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Four, Beggars, are the persons to be seen in this world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One who comprehends intuitively;<br />
					one who comprehends upon analysis;<br />
					one who comprehends after being instructed;<br />
					one who comprehends only the letter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					The second understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is Pain" upon hearing that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> incluces form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness.<br />
					The third understands the full scope of the statement: "<i>This</i> is Pain" upon hearing that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> includes form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness, and that this group of terms encompasses all that which is understood to be a living, existing being, and that birth, aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair; not getting what is wished-for; getting what is not wished-for; in a word, that the entire stockpile of temptations (form, sense-experience, own-making, and consciousness) is a heap of flaming du-k-kha.<br />
					The fourth type is able only to repeat that in Buddhism what is taught is that "This is pain" and that the scope of the term <i>'this'</i> is said to include form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness, and that this group of terms encompasses all that which is understood to be a living, existing being, and that birth, aging, sickness and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair; not getting what is wished-for; getting what is not wished-for; in a word, that the entire stockpile of temptations (form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness) is a heap of flaming du-k-kha.</p>
