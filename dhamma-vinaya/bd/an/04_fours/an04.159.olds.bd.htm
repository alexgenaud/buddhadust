<meta name="description" content="A comparison of the translations of Olds, Woodward, Bhk. Thanissaro and Bhk. Bodhi with regard to an obscure term. The issue comes up often with the question: How can one eliminate desire without desire and if one uses desire how does one eliminate desire?

					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>I wanted to take a look at the <i>Pāḷi</i> of this sutta because I wanted to see what was being translated by Woodward as "the breaking down of the bridge which is in sexual intercourse," by <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro as: "the cutting off of the bridge," and by <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi as: "the demolition of the bridge". Was this, as it is apparently understood by Woodward the Bardo-like phenomena wherein after death, in the subsequent intermediate state, one comes across a copulating couple and enters the womb? Or is this to be understood as per Bhks. Thanissaro and Bodhi as simply an admonition to stop indulging in intercourse. If the latter the use of the term 'bridge' seemed to me to be somewhat unnecessary.</p>

					<p>With the translation and explanation in detail I have managed below, I have tried to show that the idea was that while there are certain things that serve equally well for the origination of life and the achieving of freedom from individualized existence and therefore can be called 'bridges', one of them is not sexual indulgence.</p>

					<p>While I think that the bulk of the sutta points to the meaning as 'tool', as per <i>Bhks.</i> Thanissaro and Bodhi, the use of the term 'bridge' still allows for a secondary meaning pointing to an actual danger, Bardo-style, of rebirth in intercourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Ānanda was residing in Kosambī, in Ghosita Park and a certain beggar lady apparently having conceived an improper affection for him had a man approach and request that Ānanda pay her a visit. Ānanda did visit, but having correctly perceived the situation for what it was, gave her this lesson:</p>

							depending on food, let go of food;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">This body, sister, lives because of thirst:<br />
							depending on thirst, let go of thirst;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">This body, sister, lives because of insanity:<br />
							depending on insanity, let go of insanity;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">This body, sister, lives because of copulation,<br />
							but of copulation it is of terminating the bridge<br />
							which is spoken of by The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda goes on to show the meaning in each case. I understand the explanation as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Food is necessary for the maintenance of the body. Since the body is necessary in order to go from point a to point b, using food to maintain the body, eliminate all extraneous factors [eating for indulgence in sense experience, beautification, etc.,] from the act of eating. By that practice the consequences of old intentions with regard to food are used up and further intentions with regard to food are not generated. Food is used as a bridge to the elimination of intensions with regard to food with the final result that food connected to the identification with the body is eliminated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bodies come into existence as a consequence of desires. Since the desire is necessary in order to go from point a to point b, using thirst to motivate one's self to achieve the goals of the <i>Dhamma,</i> one achieves the goals of the <i>Dhamma</i>. Thirst is used as a bridge to the elimination of intentions with regard to thirsts connected to identification with the body with the final result that thirst connected to the identification with the body is eliminated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Identification with the body is a form of insanity. Since the insanity 'I am' is necessary in order to go from point a to point b, using the insanity of identification with the body as self to achieve the goals of the <i>Dhamma</i> through the mental (and insane) construction "Let me achieve the goal...", one achieves the goals of the <i>Dhamma.</i> Insanity is used as a bridge to the elimination of insane intentions with regard to identification with body with the final result that insanity connected to the identification with the body is eliminated.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body came into being because of copulation. But although the body came into being because of copulation, in the case of copulation, what The Lucky Man teaches is the burning of bridges!</p>

					<p class="f4">The sutta ends happily with the Sister confessing her error and Ānanda acknowledging it for her.</p>
