<meta name="description" content="Aṅguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 172. The Buddha describes how it is intent that is the mechanism of action of kamma of body, speech and mind that results in the personal experience of pleasure or pain in body, speech, or mind. Hearing this exposition, Sāriputta explains the details of how this works for the self-instigated action that results in rebirth, the other-instigated action that results in rebirth, the both self and other-instigated action that results in rebirth and asks the Buddha for an explanation of how there can be rebirth or not in the case where there is neither self-instigation nor other instigation. Gotama explains." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Bhadante!"</i> replied those beggars to the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Bhagava</i> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "There are these four regainings of self-life.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, beggars, the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />

					<p class="f4">There is, beggars, the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is another-intentionally walked to,<br />
					not self-intentionally.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, beggars, the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is self-intentionally walked to,<br />
					and another-intentionally.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, beggars, the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is neither self-intentionally walked to,<br />
					nor another-intentionally.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four regainings of self-life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, the Elder <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">I, <i>bhante,</i> of this of which the Lucky Man has concisely spoken, understand the expansion thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, <i>bhante,</i> the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is self-intentionally walked to,<br />
					not another-intentionally,<br />
					it is self-intentionally that those beings quit body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, <i>bhante,</i> the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is another-intentionally walked to,<br />
					not self-intentionally<br />
					it is another-intentionally that those beings quit body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, <i>bhante,</i> the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is self-intentionally walked to,<br />
					and another-intentionally<br />
					it is self-intentionally,<br />
					and another-intentionally that those beings quit body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, <i>bhante,</i> the regaining of self-life<br />
					which regaining of self-life<br />
					is neither self-intentionally walked to,<br />
					nor another-intentionally — <br />
					of this, what deva is to be understood?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Those devas, Sāriputta, are to be understood<br />
					as those uprisen in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, <i>bhante,</i> drives,<br />
					what results<br />
					in this sort of being,<br />
					upon quitting body,<br />
					to returning,<br />
					coming to it'n-n-at'n?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, <i>bhante,</i> what drives<br />
					what results<br />
					in this sort of being,<br />
					upon quitting body,<br />
					to non-returning,<br />
					not coming to it'n-n-at'n?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here Sāriputta this sort of person,<br />
					not having put down and let go<br />
					the yokes to lower rebirth<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">He savours it,<br />

					<p class="f4">Taking a stand in that,<br />

					not falling back,<br />
					having served his time<br />

					<p class="f4">Here again, Sāriputta this sort of person,<br />
					having put down and let go<br />

					he, in this seen thing,<br />

					<p class="f4">He savours it,<br />

					<p class="f4">Taking a stand in that,<br />

					he, having quit there,<br />
					is a non-returner, does not come to it'n-n-at'n.</p>

					<p class="f4">This then, Sāriputta, drives,<br />
					this results<br />
					in this sort of being,<br />
					upon quitting body,<br />
					to returning,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, Sāriputta, this drives<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Atta-bhāva-paṭilābho.</i> Really either Woodward's 'getting personality' or <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'acquisitions of individuality' would do and would be more familiar, but this translation serves to point out that what is being spoken of is 're-gaining', gaining again, living as an individual thinking of himself as having a self. The Buddha's message is, in brief, directed at action of any sort, applicable minute-to-minute, but Sāriputta takes it to the extreme case of acts which result in dropping from one form of existence and re-appearing in another.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The way I hear this, Sāriputta has been speaking about the previous sorts of ways beings (of all sorts, not just <i>devas</i>) 'shift' (<i>cuta,</i> quit, cut out) from one state to another (using the extreme case of death from one sort of life and rebirth into another), but seeing no human situation in which there is no instigator of transition, he understands it must be a <i>deva</i> that is being spoken of. Since he is Arahant and the Arahant has the ability to know whatever he wishes to know, he must feel the explanation would be best heard from the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Itth'attan.</i> Being some sort of an 'it' at some place of 'at-ness'. Woodward's (and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's): 'this state of things', but 'this state' is not implied by this term, it is more general: 'any state'. Elsewhere translators have used 'thusness,' 'suchness' and 'such and so'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>Ora-m-bhā-giyāni saṇyojanāni</i></a> (the first five). See also: <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#VeryPowerfulIndividuals">The <i>An-agamin</i></a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> In other words his returning is simply a matter of having exhausted the <i>kamma</i> that resulted in him being reborn in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception being exhausted and the attachments to worlds of sense-pleasures not having been eliminated, he 'is returned', falls back to some lower world. Or again said another way: from neither-perceivig-nor-not-perceiving, he perceives.</p>
