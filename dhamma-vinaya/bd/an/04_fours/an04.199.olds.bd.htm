The Buddha teaches about the craving that ensnares, that floats along, that is far-flung, that clings to one, by which this world is smothered, enveloped, tangled like a ball of thread, covered as with blight, twisted up like a grass-rope, so that it overpasses not the Constant Round (of rebirth), the Downfall, the Way of Woe, the Ruin." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> See Woodward, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.199.wood.pts.htm#n9">n9</a> <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/04_fours/an04.199.than.ati.htm#bad">'bad'</a>. To my ear neither 'good/bad' nor 'eternal/not-eternal' are obvious, but neither is 'happy'. I can figure a way to work either: If 'happy' the two thoughts should be at the end and apply to the whole sequence: 'At the thought, I will be, he is happy.' or they should again go at the end and be some kind of conclusion: 'I will be eternal.' All three possibilities appear to me to be present where there is the thought 'I am'.</p>
