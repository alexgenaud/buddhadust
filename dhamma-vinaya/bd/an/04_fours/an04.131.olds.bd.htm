					<h4 class="ctr">Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This sutta is especially relevant to the debate concerning whether or not there is for some a sort of continued existence between the time of death and the next rebirth.</p>

					<p>The key phrase to understand here is: <i>Antarā-parinibbāyissa. Antarā</i> from <i>antara:</i> in the interstice, "in between". Presumably after death and before final <i>Nibbāna;</i> but could it also mean after having abandoned the self-yokes that would otherwise have lead him at death to some sort of rebirth have been let go, and before final <i>Nibbāna?</i> This latter would allow the argument that there was no continuation of consciousness between births, but it would duplicate or cover the territory of other types of non-returner and such a one would be an arahant prior to or upon death so the category would be useless.</p>

					<p>The designation <i>Antarā-parinibbāyissa</i> is here defined as a person who has let go of the self-yokes which would have bound him to the lower sorts of rebirth (defined elsewhere as those realms from the Tusita worlds down); he has let go those sorts of self-yokings which would have bound him to any sort of rebirth; but has not yet let go of those sorts of self-yokes that would result in personal experience of existence <i>(bhava).</i> Think incorporeal observation, or perhaps an identified-with eye otherwise without a body, seeing objects. Having eliminated 'rebirth' from the options available, we have only one reasonable possibility as to the meaning: That subsequent to this individual's death here, but prior to his rebirth anywhere else, he continues to experience, (or there continues to be the experience of) the results of his earlier own-makings <i>(saṅkhāra).</i></p>

					<p>Why do I find this completely reasonable while it drives so many people nutz? Because of the explanation of the definition of existence as given in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15,</a> where it is said that it is only in-so-far-as there is the conjunction of consciousness with named forms that it can be said that there is existence for a thing. Such a one's prior <i>saṅkhāra</i>ming was the joining together of consciousness with named-forms; the result is identified-with consciousness of named forms. The results of earlier <i>saṅkhāra</i>ming are <i>kamma</i> which must be experienced (worked out). When the rest of the individuality has 'served its time', the body goes. When the individuality breaks up at death, if the mind isn't ready yet, consciousness of existing named-forms continues on. At a later point, 'all this' becomes cool, and such a one has attained Arahantship.</p>

					<p>It is because our 'science' cannot conceive of anything outside existence (e.g., pre-existence, post-existence, extra-sensory existence, potential existence, coming into being, etc.) that there is so much resistance to this idea.</p>

					<p>Finally, the idea that this sutta does not spell out a clear progression of ideas describing the advantages of letting go of the self-yokes: The Streamwinner who comes back but once; the Streamwinner who goes in a steady line from here to the end; the Streamwinner who is almost an arahant, but has some own-makings lagging behind, and the arahant in this visible world ... is hard to believe.</p>
