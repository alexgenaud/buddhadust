					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This is a crime in the translations of many of Gotama's suttas: the utter lack of a sense of humor.</p>

					<p>I first got interested in translating this sutta because of Bhk. Bodhi's phrase: 'lie deep within one' (Woodward's: 'occupies the mind,' Bhk. Thanissaro's 'obsessed with'). I wanted to see what word was being translated this way, and whether or not it could be understood to mean 'the unconscious.' I thought this might be a good sutta describing the process of 'making the unconscious conscious'. The word was <i>anuseti.</i> What it means is 'to bed'. And the sutta is, indeed, an excellent example of attempting to make the unconscious conscious.</p>

					<p>This is what happens when a person gives up sense-pleasures: the world is seen as it really is: obsessed with sex, finding sex in indulgence in every sense ... mind, such as it is, included.</p>

					<p>The self-indulgence is so pervasive and gross and is carried to such extremes that it becomes ridiculous. So ridiculous it is undeserving of ridicule. This is something to be discussed between two wise old hands who see and joke between themselves in terms that are utterly clear but so subtle as to be completely invisible to the blind.</p>

					<p>How come?</p>

					<p>Because the old hands are using the very terminology of the game.</p>

					<p>The blind, they know, are willfully blind and therefore will never allow themselves to see the joke.</p>

					<p>This is the real joy of the intellect, to be experienced by the man of knowledge. This is no dry droning on ... um ... finger-wagging lecture on morality! There isn't humor of this caliber anywhere to be seen today and this is a shame. And to see and experience this is a reward of this study.</p>

					<p>This is the point: This self-indulgent mind is <i>not</i> the unconscious mind. It is, for the blind, the dominant mind. What is unconscious about it is its lack of self-awareness. It is the person that is unconscious! By the mind being made to be ashamed of itself, it becomes a pure mind cohabiting with this low-life. Gradually it overcomes it's stockholm-syndrome-like, identifcation with it and frees itself from it. Before it is free it is said to be 'yoked' like the ox to the plow so to speak.</p>

					<p>It is to motivate this mind intent on purification, through awareness and shame at being ridiculous, to separate itself off that a sutta such as this is constructed. To miss the double-entendra is to miss the entire point of the sutta.</p>

					<p>You are being invited to join an elite. Take advantage!</p>

					Once upon a time the Lucky man, Vajji-land revisiting, Bhaṇḍagāma village.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Bhagava said this to the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">And 'Elder!' those beggars responded.</p>
