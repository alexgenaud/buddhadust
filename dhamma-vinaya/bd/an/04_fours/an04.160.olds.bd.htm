					<p class="f4">'Beggars, when a Welcome One<br />
					or a Welcome One's system is found in the world,<br />
					that happens for the profit of many,<br />
					the happiness of many;<br />
					out of compassion for the world,<br />
					for the good,<br />
					for the profit,<br />
					for the happiness of deities and man.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, beggars, is a Welcome One?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, beggars, a Getter-of-the-Getting arises in the world,<br />
					an Aristocrat,<br />
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and conduct,<br />
					a Welcome One,<br />
					a world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed driver of men to be driven,<br />
					Teacher of deities and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is a Welcome One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, beggars, is a Welcome One's system?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a system taught<br />
					in such a way as to be<br />
					helpful in the beginning,<br />
					helpful in the middle and<br />
					helpful at the end,<br />
					making plain the holy life,<br />
					entirely complete and purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is the system of a Welcome One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, when a Welcome One<br />
					or a Welcome One's system<br />
					is found in the world,<br />
					that happens for the profit of many,<br />
					the happiness of many;<br />
					out of compassion for the world,<br />
					for the good,<br />
					for the profit,<br />
					for the happiness of deities and man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, these four things<br />
					conduce to the undermining,<br />
					confusion,<br />
					and vanishing away<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first case, beggars,<br />
					is the case where beggars<br />
					commit to memory a sutta<br />
					in the wrong way,<br />
					with the words and their implications stated incorrectly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now beggars,<br />
					if the words and their implications<br />
					are stated incorrectly,<br />
					the intended meaning<br />
					will subsequently be understood incorrectly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first case<br />
					which conduces to the undermining,<br />
					confusion,<br />
					and vanishing away<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					the beggars become difficult to speak to,<br />
					having qualities which make them difficult to speak to;<br />
					they are intractable and incapable of being instructed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is the second case<br />
					which conduces to the undermining,<br />
					confusion,<br />
					and vanishing away<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					those beggars who are widely read,<br />
					who have got the <i>Dhamma</i> by heart,<br />
					who have got the <i>Vinaya</i> by heart,<br />
					who know the outlines,<br />
					these, not doing their duty,<br />
					do not pass along the suttas to others<br />
					and when they die<br />
					the suttas are cut down at the roots<br />
					and cannot be propagated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is the third case<br />
					which conduces to the undermining,<br />
					confusion,<br />
					and vanishing away<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					the elder beggars live in luxury,<br />
					are slackers and backsliders,<br />
					they do not carry on the tradition of solitary living<br />
					and do not set going effort to reach the goal,<br />
					to gain what can be gained,<br />
					to know what can be known.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the generation that follows<br />
					takes their example and lives in luxury,<br />
					are slackers and backsliders,<br />
					they do not carry on the tradition of solitary living<br />
					and do not set going effort to reach the goal,<br />
					to gain what can be gained,<br />
					to know what can be known.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is the fourth case<br />
					which conduces to the undermining,<br />
					confusion,<br />
					and vanishing away<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, beggars,<br />
					these four things<br />
					conduce to the maintenance,<br />
					clarification,<br />
					and propagation<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first case, beggars,<br />
					is the case where beggars<br />
					commit to memory a sutta in the correct way,<br />
					with the words and their implications stated correctly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now beggars, if the words and their implications are stated correctly,<br />
					the intended meaning will subsequently be understood correctly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first case<br />
					which conduces to the maintenance,<br />
					clarification,<br />
					and propagation<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					the beggars are easy to speak to,<br />
					having qualities which make them easy to speak to;<br />
					they are tractable<br />
					and capable of being instructed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is the second case<br />
					which conduces to the maintenance,<br />
					clarification,<br />
					and propagation<br />
					of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					those beggars who are widely read,<br />
					who have got the Dhamma by heart,<br />
					who have got the Vinaya by heart,<br />
					who know the outlines,<br />
					these, doing their duty,<br />
					pass along the suttas to others<br />
					and when they die<br />
					the suttas are not cut down at the roots<br />
					and can be propagated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is the third case<br />
					which conduces to the maintenance,<br />
					clarification,<br />
					and propagation of the good word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					the elder beggars do not live in luxury,<br />

					they do carry on the tradition of solitary living<br />
					and do set going effort to reach the goal,<br />

					to know what can be known.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the generation that follows<br />
					takes their example and does not live in luxury,<br />
					are not slackers and backsliders,<br />
					they do carry on the tradition of solitary living<br />
					and do set going effort to reach the goal,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, beggars,<br />
					these are the four things<br />
					that conduce to the undermining,<br />
					confusion,<br />
					and vanishing away<br />
					of the good word,<br />
					and these are the four things<br />
					that conduce to the maintenance,<br />
					clarification,<br />
