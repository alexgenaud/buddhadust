					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ajjhattaɱ ceto-samathassa.</i> Internal heart-calmness. Heart is not the organ, though it is the organ, it is the central part. The hearth. We say 'peace of mind'. This is peace of mind that is alert and focused.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Adhipaññā-dhamma-vipassanāya.</i> Say: Higher-wisdom-things-insight.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Saŋkhārā daṭṭhabbā.</i> Seeing that things are constructed by one's self. Note that with identification with the intent to create experience for the self there are acts of body, speech and mind which bring consequences which are experienced in accordance with the intent to make that experience pleasant or unpleasant or to create the end of sense experience (kamma). This is not the idea 'The world is created by me' or 'the world is created by the self', but the idea that the world is created by actions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Saŋkhārā sammasitabbā.</i> Own making is to be mastered much as any bad habit is mastered, through a combination of insight into it's disadvantages, tactical approaches to restraint, and willpower.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Saŋkhārā vipassitabbā.</i> Insight into own-making is seeing that the own-made is of little satisfaction, of great trouble, and doesn't last; that identification with it brings pain on it's ending, and blindness to this reality results in repeating the story over and over until it is mastered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Cittaɱ saṇṭhapetabbaɱ.</i> Another word for courage. Having the heart for the task. Putting your heart into it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Cittaɱ sannisādetabbaɱ.</i> When the heart has accepted the task there remains excitement which is an unnecessary distraction so the next step is stilling, calming, tranquillizing the heart. Steady-as-she-goes. Strong but not noticed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Cittaɱ ekodi kattabbaɱ.</i> <i>Ekodi.</i> Eka+Odhi Single-, uni-purposed. Focused, concentrated in the sense of intent on an aim. See: Morris <a href="../../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1885_ii.pdf">J.P.T.S. 1885,</a> 32 sq. Often translated as Woodward here 'one-pointed' Bhk. Bodhi here has 'unified'. The point, for me is that it is this word that should be being translated 'concentration' if any word is to be so translated, and <i>Samādhi</i> and <i>Jhāna</i> should be translated with terms closer to their root meanings: serenity and knowing or brilliance. <i>Ekodi</i> is an <i>aspect</i> of <i>samādhi,</i> <i>samādhi</i> is of greater scope than concentration by itself. The meaning is our expression: 'Single-minded' (in it's good sense). It means to take the heart in hand and eliminate it's tendency to run off in a thousand directions and set it on the purpose of attaining freedom from pain. To become 'whole-heartedly-single-minded.' But for 'whole-hearted' see: <a href="../../../pali/an/04_fours/an04.114.pali.bd.htm#p2">AN 4.114,</a> where we find the expression <i>sabbacetaso</i> whole-hearted</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Cittaɱ samādahātabbaɱ.</i> Serene. Really rolling, on top of the situation, clear sailing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Note the order in which the questions are to be asked. Note the order in which the four types of persons are listed. This suggests that the practice of the time was to first develop centered internal calm and then insight. See also <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p1">SN 5.56.1</a> for the idea that first comes calm, then understanding.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Āsavas.</i> The corrupting influence of lust, being, blindness and viewpoints.</p>
