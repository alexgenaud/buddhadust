<meta name="description" content="Aṅguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 171. The Buddha describes how it is intent that is the mechanism of action of kamma of body, speech and mind that results in the personal experience of pleasure or pain in body, speech, or mind. Intent, in turn, is shown to be impersonal. The intent driving a deed can arise in the self or in another. Further, the groundwork for action can be known or unknown. In whatever combination of factors it is blindness that is at the bottom of it and the elimination of blindness that ends kamma." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Bhadante!"</i> replied those beggars to the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Bhagava</i> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Beggars, either there being body,<br />
					the driving force of intent of body,<br />
					personal pleasure and pain arises,<br />
					or there being speech,<br />
					the driving force of intent of speech,<br />
					personal pleasure and pain arises,<br />

					<p class="f4">or not comprehending, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">3. Either by one's self, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">3. Either by one's self, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">These things, beggars, are the afflictions of blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But with the utterly dispassionate ending of blindness,<br />
					he has not got that body<br />
