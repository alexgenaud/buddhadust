					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> No <i>Nidana</i> for this sutta; the closest <i>Nidana</i> previous to this is for #68 where the Buddha is said to be residing in Rājagaha at the Vulture's Peak shortly after Devadatta had left the order.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Brāhmaṇa-gahapati;</i> brahmans and householders, but to make this apply to the current make up of society, the roles these groups held at the time are used here in stead.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Vi-sama;</i> un-even; which doesn't work, so my deviate: de + via, to swerve off course or off track.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> There will be objection here that such a thing is impossible according to our modern science. Putting aside for the time being the fact that our modern science has an almost unbroken record of being wrong; there are a couple of interpretations of this that do not conflict with our science. What is being described may not be a situation such as we see here today (USA Friday, March 28, 2003 10:46 AM) where corruption has taken over like mold on an orange, not to be stopped until it has completely ruined the orange for eating, what is being described is an observation made by seer's of huge courses of time, to be measured in millions of years, not a few decades or hundreds of years; or another way of hearing this is as an ala gory, the projection of how corruption works to throw every day life off course, souring one for the taste for life and bringing about general all-round depression and the feeling that everything is out of whack.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Recently I read that the Earth
				 	has gone off its normal course by a considerable extent. This would also alter the perceived courses of the stars.<br />
