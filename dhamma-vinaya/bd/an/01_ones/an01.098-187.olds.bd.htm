					PED: Tathāgata [Derivation uncertain. Buddhaghosa (DA I.59-67) gives eight explanations showing that there was no fixed tradition on the point, and that he himself was in doubt]. The context shows that the word is an epithet of an Arahant, and that non-Buddhists were supposed to know what it meant. The compilers of the Nikāyas must therefore have considered the expression as pre-Buddhistic; but it has not yet been found in any pre-Buddhistic work. Mrs. Rhys Davids (Dhs. tr. 1099, quoting Chalmers J.R.A.S. Jan., 1898) suggests "he who has won through to the truth." Had the early Buddhists invented a word with this meaning it would probably have been tathaɱgata, but not necessarily, for we have upadhī-karoti as well as upadhiɱ karoti. - D I.12, 27, 46, 63; II.68, 103, 108, 115, 140, 142; III.14, 24 sq., 32 sq., 115, 217, 264 sq., 273 sq.; S I.110 sq.; II.222 sq.; III.215; IV.127, 380 sq.; A I.286; II.17, 25, 120; III.35, etc.; Sn 236, 347, 467, 557, 1114; It 121 sq.; KhA 196; Ps I.121 sq.; Dhs 1099, 1117, 1234; Vbh 325 sq., 340, etc., etc.</p>

					For laymen, and in general (as opposed to the 'rules' of the Saŋgha) an offense is anything one would not wish to have done to one's self and the manner of 'redress' is to make the matter conscious by speaking about it to some respected individual, understanding the error, and making a resulution to train one's self to better behavior.</p>

Dhammapāla: anabhiṇha-ppavattitāya accharāpaharaṇa-yoggaɱ that which happens without a moment's notice, at the snap of a finger; i. e. causally unconnected (cp.

Thus freq. combd. with abbhutaɱ = how wonderful and strange, marvellous, beyond comprehension, e. g.
