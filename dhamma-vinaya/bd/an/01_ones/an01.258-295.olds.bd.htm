					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Apubbam acarimam.</i> Not before, not after. The way I hear it, this means that a new Buddha does not appear before the last vestige of the previous Buddha has died out — there are descriptions of this process; it comes down to one line of the true Dhamma being remembered by one individual, and then it dies out. How come? Because a 'Buddha' is the Dhamma, so the life (Time) of a Buddha is the lifetime of his Dhamma. This would explain the issue for a Buddha; but it cannot apply to a Wheel-Rolling King for we are given numerous examples of Wheel-rolling Kings yielding their position to their sons.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> See note 6, above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> It is not here being said that a person who is now a woman could never become a Buddha (or any of the other "Office Holders" that follow. In theory, such a person would "only" need to become a male prior to such a happening: the fact is that this is no easy change to make, and any being capable of making such a change would be more likely to devote the energy to becoming a "simple" Arahant. On the other side of the story, a being destined to become a Buddha will have undergone countless lives as a female. The statement exists that the Buddha's mother, now residing in the Tussita Realm, is to become a future Buddha. I do not know how the commentaries deal with this. The Tussita Realm is the realm in which future Buddha's wait their turn. The presumption is that in her descent into her final life in this world she will take birth as a male.</p>
