					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> This sutta and the one that follows are translated for meaning. For me, trying to follow the Pali results in a statement in English that can be understood to mean its opposite.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This section [#s 348-377 of our versions of the Pali Text and Woodward's translation] appears to be mangled in both in different ways. The PTS Text version leaves off the introductory paragraphs and indicates [no ellipsis] that this is really one sutta. The Sri Lanka Buddha Jayanti Tripitaka Series version breaks out each section into three suttas including the introductory paragraph in each.<br />
					All versions (except here) have the order out of wack, creating duplicates.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Generally the progression given elsewhere in the suttas is Deva &gt; Man &gt; Animal &gt; Ghost &gt; Hell. The progression in this series in the PTS and BJT goes:</p>

					<p class="lgqt g">[KEY: x &gt; y = born as x, reborn as y; + = duplicate]</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Man &gt; Man<br />
					Man &gt; Hell<br />
					Man &gt; Animal<br />
					Man &gt; Ghost<br />
					Man &gt; Gods<br />
					Man &gt; Hell<br />
					Man &gt; Animal +<br />
					Man &gt; Ghost +<br />
					Gods &gt; Gods<br />
					Gods &gt; Hell<br />
					Gods &gt; Animal<br />
					Gods &gt; Ghost<br />
					Gods &gt; Man<br />
					Gods &gt; Hell +<br />
					Gods &gt; Animal +<br />
					Gods &gt; Ghost +<br />
					Hell &gt; Man<br />
					Hell &gt; Hell<br />

					Ghost &gt; Animal +<br />
					Ghost &gt; Ghost +</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><b>The structure should be:</b><br />
					Gods &gt; Gods,<br />
					Gods &gt; Man,<br />
					Gods &gt; Animals,<br />
					Gods &gt; Ghosts,<br />
					Gods &gt; Hell;<br />
					Man &gt; Gods,<br />
					Man &gt; Man,<br />
					Man &gt; Animals,<br />
					Man &gt; Ghosts,<br />
					Man &gt; Hell;<br />
					Animals &gt; Gods,<br />
					Animals &gt; Man,<br />
					Animals &gt; Animals,<br />

					Ghosts &gt; Gods<br />
					Ghosts &gt; Man<br />
					Ghosts &gt; Animals,<br />
					Ghosts &gt; Ghosts,<br />
					Ghosts &gt; Hell,<br />
					Hell &gt; Gods,<br />
					Hell &gt; Man,<br />
					Hell &gt; Animals,<br />
					Hell &gt; Ghosts<br />
					Hell &gt; Hell.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is not simply an alternative order. The reversing of the usual 'Animal, Ghost, Hell' order, and beginning the series with 'Man' in stead of 'Gods' has made it necessary to loop back and include duplicates. This is not correct 'wheel' style sutta construction, totally destroys the image and by that the lesson...it's one steep drop! And it is not stylistically or pedantically what we would expect from Gotama.<br />
					Sutta numbers/links for this section are omitted except for the first sutta and resume at the next section skipping the omitted duplicate suttas.</p>
