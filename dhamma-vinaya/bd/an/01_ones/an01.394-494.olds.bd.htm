This is a behavior cycle typically interpreted as Manic behavior followed by Depression. If, in stead of seeing the Manic state as a state of energetic effort leading to frenzy, a deeper interpretation is given to it, that is, that it is behavior stimulated by coveting, or intense desire or wanting, a calming of this behavior is suggested in directing the attention to the disadvantages of gain. With the so called Manic side given less power over the resources of the individual, the consequent depression is less severe.</p>

[Edit: still later I have opted for 'serenity' as the best all-round translation for <i>samādhi</i>]<br />
					PED: [excerpt, <b>bf</b> added for emphasis]: <i>Samādhi</i> [from <i>saṇ+ā+dhā</i>] 1. concentration; a concentrated, <b>self-collected,</b> intent state of mind and meditation, which, concomitant with right living, is a necessary condition to the attainment of higher wisdom and emancipation. In the <i>Subha-suttant</i>a of the <i>Dīgha</i> (D I.209 sq.) <i>samādhi-khandha</i> ("section on concentration") is the title otherwise given to the <i>citta-sampadā,</i> which, in the ascending order of merit accruing from the life of a <i>samaṇa</i> (see <i>Sāmaññaphala-suttanta,</i> and cp. Dial. I.57 sq.) stands between the <i>sīla-sampadā</i> and the <i>paññā-sampadā.</i> In the <i>Ambaṭṭha-sutta</i> the corresponding terms are <i>sīla, caraṇa, vijjā</i> (D. I.100). Thus <i>samādhi</i> would comprise (a) the guarding of the senses <i>(indriyesu gutta-dvāratā),</i> (b) self-possession <i>(sati-sampajañña),</i> (c) contentment <i>(santuṭṭhi),</i> (d) emancipation from the 5 hindrances <i>(nīvaraṇāni),</i> (e) the four <i>jhānas.</i><br />
					<b>OED:</b> Focus. To draw to a focus; to cause to converge to or as to a focus ... That point or position at which an object ... may be clear and well-defined. Hence in, or out of focus, lit. and fig. depth of focus (of a lens): the power of giving a 'sharp' image of objects not in the same plane ... also, the adjustment (of the eye, or an eyeglass) necessary to produce a clear image.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Woodward adds some text here which I am not sure is justified. His reading of this case is (parentheses his):</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"... If, (to attain the form-world, he cultivates the path thereto and) conscious of form quality in his own person, he sees objects external to himself to be limited and fair or foul, and, having mastered them with the thought: 'I know: I see,' is thus conscious (of knowing and seeing, and so enters the musings) ..."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">He explains in a footnote: "... They are the Eight Stations of Mastery <i>(Abhibhāyatana = abhibhū + āyatana)</i> ... To elucidate the difficulties of the compressed sentences I have translated and bracketed the parts omitted."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I believe he is saying he is including stock phrases of other expositions of the Eight Stations of Mastery — not form that we can say for certain was mistakenly omitted. In the <i>Dīgha</i> (D.II.110)(Dialogues II. 118) the text reads the same as here. I suspect he is taking the interpretations made by commentators and translators and filling in the blanks he thinks are there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This set of concepts — The <i>Abhibhāyatana:</i> Lit: the Overbeing Realms; usually translated the Stations of Mastery — is in any case difficult to grasp. I believe this is the case because they are stated from the point of view of one who has attained the level of mastery at least one level above that level which is being described: in other words, in the case of the first case for example, looking down (so to speak) on the form world, seeing "one's own" form, one sees external form shapes as finite, whether beautiful or ugly, and one is consciously aware and understands what one is seeing. Woodward's "to attain the form-world, he cultivates the path thereto —" is in my view <i>one</i> application of this station of mastery. In the burnings it is as important to know how to emerge from the "trance" as it is to get into it. To emerge into what we here would call the ordinary world (the Form World) seeing in this way would bring one into line with the way this world is normally seen and would give one the method for re-entry. There are other applications than re-entry, such as not re-entering, but moving higher: having become aware that one is close to re-entry one would be able to renew one's resolve to go higher.]</p>

These are often referred to as the 'Stages of Release'. the first of these might seem on a quick glance to be no more than ordinary consciousness. I explain this to myself as being either of two cases: the first is that of the perception that although we all think we are aware of our form selves and the world, in fact very few are, so the recognition of the fact is in fact a stage of release; the second is that it is implied that along with the perception is "knowing and seeing": namely of the changeable, painful, and not-self nature of the form quality of things. Again, in the second stage (as in the above sequences also) the "not perceiving" indicated is not blind unconsciousness, but having achieved a state where no form quality is seen as belonging to the self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Bhāveti.</i> Here my personal inclination is to stay "tries" "experiments with", but the commentators will more likely have this as having achieved the degree of mastery over the device which brings about the so-called "reflex image." This is a mental after image of the device which is then refreshed in mind and made more and more vivid to the degree that it provides a bridge between the imagined, and the ordinary real world. At this stage it manifests a variety of uses for the accomplishment of magic powers (for example, the after image of the earth device might be projected on water to enable the power to walk on water). Still, for <i>Pāḷi</i> Buddhists, the primary use of any device should be insight into things as they really are.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I can remember at one point using the earth device. I was living in New York (where dirt is somewhat scarce, although filth is plentiful) so I wrote home to request some sifted earth. I made the device <a href="../../../../backmatter/exercises/earth_kasina.htm">according to the specifications</a>. I placed the device in front of my seat at a distance comfortable for viewing, and began to concentrate. Quite a while later I became aware of a scent which was vaguely familiar. Then it occurred to me: I could smell in this earth the odor of the pet cat I had had as a child. the true nature of <i>paṭhavi</i> (Earth, solidity) had been revealed to me!</p>
