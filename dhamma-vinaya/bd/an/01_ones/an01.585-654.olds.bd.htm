					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Woodward has:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Even as one, monks, who embraces with his mind's eye the mighty ocean includes therewith all the rivulets whatsoever that run into the ocean; just so, monks, by whomsoever mindfulness relating to body is practiced, made much of and plunged into, — in him exist all good states whatsoever that have part in wisdom."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The phrase at issue is: <i>cetasaa phuto</i> — Woodward's: "embraces with his mind's eye" — seeing in the expression the psychic power of clairvoyance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The term <i>"phuto"</i> (PED: &gt; <i>pharati &gt; sphur, sphar,</i> to twitch; Lat <i>sperno</i> "spurn"; lit. kick away; to excite or stimulate the nerves) (— to me it sounds like an onomat for "spray"; say phooey!) seems to be highly correlated with two floral activities: the blossoming and casting forth of scent by a flower, and the splitting open of a seed pod and the casting forth of the seed (the way a mustard seed pod bursts and casts out its seed comes to mind). PED has: pervade, permeate, thrill, expand, spread out, spread with, fill, spread out over. To me there is a world of difference between these and "embrace." Or encompass with the mind, etc. To me "embrace" implies having mastered where pervade implies investigation perhaps without limits. This, in turn, has critical importance in the second half of the simile where we must ask: "Is it that when we practice mindfulness relating to body good states that have part in wisdom are automatically created; or is it that we should, in our making a big thing of recollection of body, include also those skillful things that conduce to vision.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">More critical in my estimation, however is <i>"sati",</i> here and through to the end in the term <i>kāya-gatāsati.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Starting with the <i>Pāḷi</i> English Dictionary:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Sati</i> [see etym. Under <i>sarati</i> (2)]</p>

					<p class="lgqt">But first I think it is important to know of <i>Sarati</i> (1): to go, to flow, run, move along; 1. to make go; 2. to rub, to mix</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Sarati</i> (2): [Lat <i>memor, memoria</i> = memory; Greek <i>care,</i> witness, martyr; Gothic <i>maurnan</i> = English mourn, to care] to remember; caus. <i>Sāreti</i> to remind</p>

					<p class="lgqt">[so on with <i>sati</i>] memory, recognition, consciousness, intentness of mind, wakefulness of mind, mindfulness, alertness, lucidity of mind, self-possession, conscience, self-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The task we have in selecting a term to be used to understand this word is that it must be made to "taste of freedom." Those definitions which do not include the idea of letting go (or include the idea of 'ever-minding') are omitting half of the meaning of this term as described in painstaking detail in the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22"><i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i></a> (other translator's use of the term mindfulness notwithstanding). Look at the idea of flow and go in the first definition of the root concept; think of what is happening in the process of mourning or remembering the dead. These are ideas which speak of saying goodbye, of process. So in my choice of the phrase "Minding body" I am again suggesting that what is thought of here is that which is encompassed in the idea of satisfaction: penetrating knowledge and release. Penetrating knowledge of the transience of body, the pain associated with that transience, and seeing that as a consequence, "body" cannot be the "self" or "of the self." And then letting it go. Mindfulness and attention and such ideas just never let go and this is a huge error! Read the "refrains" between the sections (for example, <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#body">for "Body"</a>), the emphasis is not for nothing: "This is the way to live in a body so seeing body that one releases one's angry downbound longing and misery, and rising above it all, watchful and diligent, satisfied, reviewing and calming down, overcoming any <i>taṇhā</i> that may appear, one is bound up bound up in nothing at all in the World."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Anusaya.</i> PED: bent, bias proclivity, the persistence of a dormant or latent disposition, predisposition, tendency. Always in a bad sense. In the oldest texts the word usually occurs absolutely, without mention of the cause or direction of the bias. Thus my trans, but usually translated "lurking tendencies" as with Woodward, and meaning specific, although varying, sets made up of: 1. pride, doubt, 2. ignorance, lust, hatred, 3. delusion and craving for rebirth.</p>
