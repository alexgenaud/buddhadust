					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding:<br />
					"Broke Tooth!"<br />
					Bhagava said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For one of poor ethics, beggars,<br />
					for the ethically bereft,<br />
					consummate serenity has had its means of support cut off.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consummate serenity not being,<br />

					has had its means of support cut off.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Knowing and seeing things as they are not being,<br />
					for the knowing-and-seeing-bereft,<br />
					world-weary dispassion has had its means of support cut off.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">World-weary dispassion not being,<br />
					for the world-weary-dispassionate-bereft,<br />
					freedom through knowledge and vision has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In just the same way, beggars, as with a tree<br />
					stripped of its branches and leaves,<br />
