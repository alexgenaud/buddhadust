					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, The Lucky Man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a><br />
					came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, to the Beggars gathered round, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding:<br />
					"Broke Tooth!"<br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For one of poor ethics, beggars,<br />
					for the ethically bereft,<br />
					consummate serenity has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate serenity not being,<br />
					for the consummate-serenity-bereft,<br />
					knowing and seeing things as they are<br />
					has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing and seeing things as they are not being,<br />
					for the knowing-and-seeing-bereft,<br />
					world-weary dispassion has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">World-weary dispassion not being,<br />
					for the world-weary-dispassionate-bereft,<br />
					freedom through knowledge and vision has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In just the same way, beggars, as with a tree<br />
					stripped of its branches and leaves,<br />
					its component parts just do not reach maturity.</p>

					<p class="f4">The bark just doesn't reach maturity,<br />
					the soft-wood just doesn't reach maturity,<br />
					the heartwood just doesn't reach maturity.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Even so then, beggars, for one of poor ethics,<br />
					for the ethically-bereft,<br />
					consummate serenity has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate serenity not being,<br />
					for the consummate-serenity-bereft,<br />
					knowing and seeing things as they are<br />
					has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing and seeing things as they are not being,<br />
					for the knowing-and-seeing-bereft,<br />
					world-weary dispassion has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">World-weary dispassion not being,<br />
					for the world-weary-dispassionate-bereft,<br />
					freedom through knowledge and vision has had its means of support cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. For the ethically practiced, beggars,<br />
					for one who is ethically endowed,<br />
					consummate serenity is well endowed with means of support.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate serenity being,<br />
					for the consummate-serenity-well-endowed,<br />
					knowing and seeing things as they are is well-endowed with means of support.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing and seeing things as they are being,<br />
					for the knowing-and-seeing-things-as-they-are-well-endowed,<br />
					world-weary dispassion is well-endowed with means of support.</p>

					for the world-weary-dispassion-well-endowed,<br />

					<p class="f4">5. In just the same way, beggars, as with a tree<br />
					endowed with branches and leaves,<br />
					the component parts of such may easily reach maturity.</p>

					<p class="f4">The bark may easily reach maturity,<br />
					the soft-wood may easily reach maturity,<br />
					the heartwood may easily reach maturity.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. For the ethically practiced, beggars,<br />
					for one who is ethically endowed,<br />
					consummate serenity is well endowed with means of support.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate serenity being,<br />
