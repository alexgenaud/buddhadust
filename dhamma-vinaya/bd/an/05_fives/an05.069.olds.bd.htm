If a person can develop and make a big thing of the idea of their being nothing attractive in the body, the disgusting nature of food, the thought of distaste for the world, the perception of impermanance in everything that has been own-made, and has established in his mind the thought of death, he may expect Arahantship even in this life." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i> Sāvatthi-town, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park, came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, to the Beggars gathered round, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And: "Broke Tooth!" the Beggars gathered round responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>Bhagava</i> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars! These five things when made become,<br />
					when made a big deal of,<br />
					result in extreme satisfaction,<br />
					dispassion,<br />
					ending,<br />
					settling down,<br />
					higher knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here a Beggar lives seeing the impure<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> nature of the body;<br />
					the disgusting nature of food,<br />
					perceiving nothing to delight in in all the world,<br />
					sees the impermanent nature of all own-made things,<br />
					and perceiving that death applies to one personally.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars! These five things when made become,<br />
					when made a big deal of,<br />
					result in extreme satisfaction,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					dispassion,<br />
					ending,<br />
					settling down,<br />
					higher knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This is not a word with moral connotations in this use. It means something like physically dirty. "The intestines of a 50 year old man, beggars, look like a sewer that has not been cleaned in 50 years."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The final phrase: <i>marana-sanna kho pan'assa ajjhattam supa-ṭ-ṭhita hoti,</i> translated by Hare: "... and the thought of death is by him inwardly well established," accords with the usual understanding. My interpretation is that this term <i>"ajjhattam"</i> is used to avoid the term "his own" or "own" "personal". But here it may have lead to a misunderstanding of the intent which I believe is the fact that one has come to see that "My own body" too will die, has not risen above that state, is subject to such an end as that. See: <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#internal"><i>Satipaṭṭhana,</i> Charnal Ground.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Extreme Satisfaction is <i>ekanta-nibbidaya.</i> I assume most translators avoid the acceptable translation of this term as satisfaction for the reason that that word is most often heard in an exactly wrong way. Here the intended meaning is "having had enough" fed up. The difficulty with the word used by Hare and others (probably also myself!), "disgust" is that it is often heard in a way that reflects a non-Buddhist state of mind — "disgust" when understood as an active disliking — and the goal must taste of indifference, <i>upekkha,</i> objective detachment; the reader should when coming across "disgust" in translations hear this as "an absence of taste for, an absence of gusto.</p>
