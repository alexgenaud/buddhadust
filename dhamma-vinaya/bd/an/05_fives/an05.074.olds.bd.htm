					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i> Sāvatthi-town, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park, came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain <i>Bhikkhu</i> came to pay a call,<br />
					and, after paying respect with closed palms,<br />
					he sat on a low seat to one side<br />
					at a respectful distance<br />
					and asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Walk'n the Talk' is the expression.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent, <i>Bhagavā</i> does one<br />
					'walk the talk'<br />
					in this <i>Dhamma?</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the case of the first case<br />
					we have the case of the Beggar<br />
					who has an all-round understanding of <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">He spends his day in the mastering of <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					but that beyond,<br />
					which is attained through wisdom,<br />
					he knows not.</p>

					<p class="f4">This beggar, beggar, is said to be big on all-round understanding,<br />
					but does not live the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the second case<br />
					we have the case of the beggar<br />
					who teaches <i>Dhamma</i> to others as he has heard and understood it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends his time instructing and inciting others<br />
					but that beyond,<br />
					which is attained through wisdom,<br />
					he knows not.</p>

					<p class="f4">This beggar, beggar, is said to be big on wisdom,<br />
					but does not live the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the third case<br />
					we have the case of the beggar<br />
					who is a repeater.</p>

					<p class="f4">He memorizes <i>Dhamma</i> and repeats it to others as he has heard it<br />
					and so spends his day<br />
					but that beyond,<br />
					which is attained through wisdom,<br />
					he knows not.</p>

					<p class="f4">This beggar, beggar, is said to be big on memory,<br />
					but does not live the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the fourth case<br />
					we have the case of the beggar<br />
					who is a thinker.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks about <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					as he has heard it and understood it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends his day thinking about <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					but that beyond,<br />
					which is attained through wisdom,<br />
					he knows not.</p>

					<p class="f4">This beggar, beggar, is said to be big on thinking, but does not live the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the fifth case<br />
					we have the case of the beggar<br />
					who has an all-round understanding of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					does not spend his entire day in the understanding of,<br />
					memorization of,<br />
					and thinking about <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					he does not neglect putting down interaction<br />
					and does devote himself to mental tranquillity within<br />
					and that beyond,<br />
					which is attained through wisdom,<br />
					he knows.</p>

					<p class="f4">This beggar, beggar, is said to 'Walk the Talk'.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Beggar,<br />
					I have given you one who is big on understanding,<br />
					one who is big on wisdom,<br />
					one who is big on memory,<br />
					one who is big on thinking,<br />
					and one who 'Walks the talk'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggar! What a teacher should do for his student,<br />
					looking after his well-being,<br />
					seeking his good,<br />
					out of sympathy,<br />
					such is such as I have done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are the roots of trees,<br />
					places of solitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not be negligent,<br />
					do not give yourself cause for self-recrimination later.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>
