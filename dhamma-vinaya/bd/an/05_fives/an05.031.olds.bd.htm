Sumana, Raja Pasanadi's sister, has waited a long time to join the order as she first felt the need to take care of her grandmother.

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi-town,</a> Jeta Woods, Anāthapiṇḍika Park,<br />
					came a revisit'n.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Sumana, the daughter of the king,<br />
					sister of King Pasenadi,<br />
					rajah of Kosala,<br />
					along with 500 handmaidens<br />
					in 500 chariots<br />
					came to pay a call.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, after paying respect with closed palms,<br />
					she sat on a low seat to one side<br />
					at a respectful distance and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the case, Bhante,<br />
					where there were two disciples of the Bhaggava<br />
					who were of equal faith,<br />
					equal ethical culture,<br />
					and equal understanding,<br />
					but where there was a difference<br />
					in their practice of generosity,<br />
					one being a giver and one not,<br />
					and both were to find consciousness again<br />
					after the death of the body<br />
					in a happy condition<br />
					among the gods:<br />
					would there be any noticeable difference between them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There would be a difference, Sumana,"<br />
					said the Lucky Man,<br />
					"The giver, finding consciousness again<br />
					in a happy condition<br />
					among the gods<br />
					would be better off in five ways:<br />
					life,<br />
					beauty,<br />
					ease,<br />
					energy<br />
					and strength of wits."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But supposing, Bhante,<br />
					that these two should once again find rebirth as Man,<br />
					would there continue to be any noticeable difference between them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There would be a difference, Sumana.</p>

					<p class="f4">The giver finding consciousness again as Man<br />
					would be better off in five ways:<br />
					life,<br />
					beauty,<br />
					ease,<br />
					energy<br />
					and strength of wits."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But supposing, Bhante,<br />
					that these two should leave the householder's life<br />
					and go forth into homelessness,<br />
					would there continue to be any noticeable difference between them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There would be difference, Sumana.</p>

					<p class="f4">The giver, leaving the householder's life<br />
					and going forth into homelessness,<br />
					would be better off in five ways:<br />
					in the frequency of the times<br />
					he was asked to accept robes;<br />
					in the frequency of the times<br />
					he was asked to accept food;<br />
					in the frequency of the times<br />
					he was asked to accept shelter;<br />
					in the frequency of the times<br />
					he was asked to accept medicines;<br />
					and furthermore,<br />
					his companions in the life<br />
					tend to act towards him<br />
					with friendliness<br />
					in body, speech and mind<br />
					and often offer to do him services."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But supposing, Bhante,<br />
					that these two should both win Arahantship,<br />
					would there continue to be any noticeable difference between them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the case of this case, Sumana,<br />
					I say there is no difference<br />
					to be perceived between them,<br />
					comparing freedom with freedom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, Bhante,<br />
					it is marvelous<br />
					the extent of the positive effects<br />
					of giving and doing good deeds:<br />
					a help to one as a man,<br />
					a help to one as a god,<br />
					and a help to one as one gone forth!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Sumana! Even so!"</p>
