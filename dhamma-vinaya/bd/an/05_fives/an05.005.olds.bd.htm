					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Sikkhā-Pacca-k-khāna.</i> "Rejecting out-of-hand" is probably too strong. What is usually the case (at least in the <i>Suttas</i>) is that a <i>Bhikkhu</i>-in-training finds the job too difficult, and admits that it is he, himself, and not the training, that is at fault. In the case in this sutta the reference is to one who leaves the training without admitting his weakness, essentially rejecting the <i>Dhamma,</i> and not going through the formal renunciation of <i>bhikkhu.</i></p>
