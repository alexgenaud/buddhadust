					<p class="f4">The trust-ally,<br />
					the sense-of-shame-ally,<br />
					the fear-of-blame-ally,<br />
					the energy-ally,<br />
					the wisdom-ally.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the trust-ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has trust.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has trust in the awakening of the <i>Tathāgata</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is the <i>Bhagava,</i> Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened, perfected in vision and conduct, The Welcome One, World-Knower, unsurpassable <i>Dhamma</i>-coach for man, teacher of gods and men, a Buddha, The Lucky Man.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the trust ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the sense-of-shame-ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has sense-of-shame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-of-shame follows after injurious conduct of body, injurious conduct of speech, injurious conduct of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-of-shame follows after any bad, unskillful state he attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the sense-of-shame-ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the fear-of-blame-ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has fear-of-blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fear-of-blame follows after injurious conduct of body, injurious conduct of speech, injurious conduct of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fear-of-blame follows after any bad, unskillful state he attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the fear-of-blame-ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the energy-ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats is habitually energetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of unskillful things,<br />
					acquiring skillful things,<br />
					steadfastly pursuing progress,<br />
					not putting down the yoke of skillful things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the energy-ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the wisdom-ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is wise to comings and goings<br />
					having penetrated for himself<br />
					that consummate Aristocratic going to the end of pain.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the wisdom-ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, then, Beggars, are five allies of the seeker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Beggars, train yourselves this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'the trust-ally,' ally of seekers.</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'the sense-of-shame-ally,' ally of seekers.</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'the fear-of-blame-ally,' ally of seekers.</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'the energy-ally,' ally of seekers.</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'the wisdom-ally,' ally of seekers.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you should train yourselves!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Bhk. Thanissaro (<i>Wings to Awakening,</i> pp 140): "Now what, monks, is the faculty of conviction? There is the case where a monk, a noble disciple, has conviction, is convinced of the <i>Tathāgata's</i> Awakening: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine and human beings, awakened, blessed.'"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Hare pp. 2: "Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith and believes in the enlightenment of the <i>Tathāgata:</i> Of a truth he is the Exalted One, arahant, fully enlightened, abounding in wisdom and right, the well-gone, the world-knower, the incomparable tamer of tamable men, the teacher of devas and men, the Buddha, the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Since this is a series directed at the seeker, not the adept, I view this as intending "understanding the <i>Magga</i>", The Way: High Views; High Principles, High Talk, High Works, High Lifestyle, High Self-Control, High Mind, and High Getting High.</p>
