					The Wisdom-Ally.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the Trust-Ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has trust.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He has trust in the awakening of the Tathāgata:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Thus is the Bhagava, Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened, perfected in vision and conduct, The Wellcome One, World-Knower, unsurpassable Dhamma-coach for man, teacher of gods and men, A Buddha, The Lucky Man.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the Trust Ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the Sense-of-Shame-Ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has Sense-of-Shame.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sense-of-Shame follows after injurious conduct of body, injurious conduct of speech, injurious conduct of mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sense-of-Shame follows after any bad, unskillful state he attains.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the Sense-of-Shame-Ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the Fear-of-Blame-Ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has Fear-of-Blame.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fear-of-Blame follows after injurious conduct of body, injurious conduct of speech, injurious conduct of mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fear-of-Blame follows after any bad, unskillful state he attains.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the Sense-of-Shame-Ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the Energy-Ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats is habitually energetic.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Letting go of unskillful things,<br />
					acquiring skillful things,<br />
					steadfastly persuing progress,<br />
					not putting down the yoke of skillful things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the Energy-Ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Beggars, is the Wisdom-Ally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats has Wisdom.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is wise to comings and goings<br />
					having penetrated for himself<br />
					that consummate Aristocratic going to the end of pain.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, Beggars, is the Wisdom-Ally, so say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, then, Beggars, are five allies of the seeker.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Beggars, train yourselves this way:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'The Trust-Ally,' ally of seekers;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'The Sense-of-Shame-Ally,' ally of seekers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'The Fear-of-Blame-Ally,' ally of seekers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'The Energy-Ally,' ally of seekers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We shall make live within us 'The Wisdom-Ally,' ally of seekers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how you should train yourselves!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Bhk. Thanissaro (Wings to Awakening, pp 140): "Now what, monks, is the faculty of conviction? There is the case where a monk, a noble disciple, has conviction, is convinced of the Tathāgata's Awakening: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine and human beings, awakened, blessed.'"<br />
					Hare pp. 2: "Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith and believes in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata: Of a truth he is the Exalted One, arahant, fully enlightened, abounding in wisdom and right, the well-gone, the world-knowler, the incomparable tamer of tamable men, the techer of devas and men, the Buddha, the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Since this is a series directed at the seeker, not the adept, I view this as intending "understanding the Magga", The Way: High Views; High Principles, High Talk, High Works, High Lifestyle, High Self-Control, High Mental Preparation, and High Getting High.</p>
