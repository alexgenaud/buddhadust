<meta name="description" content="Aṅguttara Nikāya, Fives, Sutta 51. The Buddha likens a person mastered by wishing for sense pleasure, hate, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling, and doubt and vacillation (the Nivaranas — diversions) to a stream which has been diverted and no longer has its original strength or free will. Then he likens a person who has mastered desire for sense pleasures, hatred, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling and doubt and vacillation to a stream whose diversions have been closed off and which has regained its strength and free will." />

					<p class="f4">There then, the Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual-desire, beggars is a distraction,<br />
					a diversion overgrowing the heart,<br />
					making for the debilitation of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Āvaraṇā</i> and <i>nīvaraṇā. Āvaraṇā:</i> to weave (veer) or to open; and <i>nīvaraṇā</i> to 'down' (tear down, bring down, open up) a barrier. Most frequently translated in a way that indicates the making or encountering of a barrier, but the simile asks that this be understood in an inverse way as in the destruction of or distraction from a natural course.</p>
