					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town came a revisit'n.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these five states which are unattainable<br />
					by shaman, brahman, God, gods or the Devil;<br />
					not by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The state where there is aging but no old age.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first state which is unattainable<br />
					by shaman, brahman, God, gods or the Devil;<br />
					not by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The state where there is going but no being gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second state which is unattainable<br />
					by shaman, brahman, God, gods or the Devil;<br />
					not by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The state where there is dying but no death.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third state which is unattainable<br />
					by shaman, brahman, God, gods or the Devil;<br />
					not by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The state where there is passing but no passing away.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth state which is unattainable<br />
					by shaman, brahman, God, gods or the Devil;<br />
					not by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The state where there is disappearance but no disappearing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth state which is unattainable<br />
					by shaman, brahman, God, gods or the Devil;<br />
					not by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars! For the untamed, untrained, uneducated common man,<br />
					aging brings old age.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when old age approaches<br />
					he does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aging does not bring old age only to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever aging is to be seen,<br />
					there one also sees<br />
					the arriving and departing,<br />
					passing away and coming to be of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">To one and all aging brings old age.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were one who,<br />
					when old age comes<br />
					were to weep and lament,<br />
					grieve and complain,<br />
					beat my breast in frustration, anger and despair,<br />
					then food would no longer provide enjoyment<br />
					and wasting would afflict my body<br />
					and my business would suffer<br />
					and my enemies would be happy<br />
					while my friends would be sad.'</p>
