					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Samaya-vimutti.</i> 'Con-time-' or 'with-time' or 'of-time' freedom. Note the expression opening most suttas: <i>"Ekam samayam ..."</i> "Once upon a time." The meaning I believe is not, for this, 'temporary-freedom' (although the sutta is dealing with what makes temporary release temporary), but freedom based on or connected to perception of things as bound up in Time. The nature of this freedom is unstable and the attainer is subject to falling back, but not in all cases. Related to this freedom is <i>Asamaya-vimutti. Asamaya-vimutti</i> is attained when the freedom in freedom from things of time is separated off (by reflection on the heart as freed) and freedom from things of time is itself taken as the object of freedom and is recognized as the goal: <i>i.e.,</i> <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>
