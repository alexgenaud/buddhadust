					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man, Sāvatthi-town, Jeta Woods, Anāthapiṇḍika Park, came a revisit'n.<br />
					There, Anāthapiṇḍika, the housefather, came to pay a call, and,<br />
					after paying respect with closed palms,<br />
					he sat on a low seat to one side at a respectful distance,<br />
					and Bhaggava said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are these five reasons for getting rich.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What five?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the case of the first case,<br />
					a student of the Aristocrats gets rich in a just, lawful manner;<br />
					by the strength of his arm,<br />
					the sweat of his brow;<br />
					hard work,<br />
					energy,<br />
					enterprise and<br />
					intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his wealth so earned he makes himself happy<br />
					and he is able to sustain that happiness;<br />
					he makes his parents happy<br />
					and he is able to sustain their happiness;<br />
					he makes his wife and children happy<br />
					and he is able to sustain their happiness;<br />
					he makes his employees happy<br />
					and he is able to sustain their happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first case.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the second case,<br />
					a student of the Aristocrats gets rich in a just, lawful manner;<br />
					by the strength of his arm,<br />
					the sweat of his brow;<br />
					hard work,<br />
					energy,<br />
					enterprise and<br />
					intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his wealth so earned<br />
					he makes his friends and companions happy<br />
					and he is able to sustain their happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second case.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the third case,<br />
					a student of the Aristocrats gets rich in a just, lawful manner;<br />
					by the strength of his arm,<br />
					the sweat of his brow;<br />
					hard work,<br />
					energy,<br />
					enterprise and<br />
					intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his wealth so earned<br />
					he is able to set up protections<br />
					against loss through disaster,<br />
					fire,<br />
					water,<br />
					kings,<br />
					robbers,<br />
					enemies and<br />
					greedy heirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third case.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of the fourth case,<br />
					a student of the Aristocrats gets rich in a just, lawful manner;<br />
					by the strength of his arm,<br />
					the sweat of his brow;<br />
					hard work,<br />
					energy,<br />
					enterprise and<br />
					intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his wealth so earned<br />
					he makes the Five-Dimensional Offering Ceremony,<br />
					offering gifts and nourishment,<br />
					remembrance and gratitude to<br />
					kinfolk,<br />
					friends,<br />
					ancestors,<br />
					kings, and<br />
					the gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth case.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, in addition,<br />
					a student of the Aristocrats gets rich in a just, lawful manner;<br />
					by the strength of his arm,<br />
					the sweat of his brow;<br />
					hard work,<br />
					energy,<br />
					enterprise and<br />
					intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his wealth so earned<br />
					he makes gifts to shaman and godly men;<br />
					men of modest demeanor<br />
					who have let go of lazy ways,<br />
					bearing all with patience,<br />
					men who have stilled,<br />
					calmed,<br />
					controlled the self,<br />
					perfected the self,<br />
					abandoned the self;<br />
					gifts aimed at the high,<br />
					the godly,<br />
					resulting in happiness,<br />
					leading to the godly realms.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth case.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five reasons for getting rich.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, householder,<br />
					should the wealth of such a one,<br />
					having gathered wealth with these five reasons in mind,<br />
					come to destruction,<br />
					he may rightly think:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'At least this wealth now lost<br />
					was gathered for righteous reasons.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will find he is without shame or regret.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if his wealth should grow<br />
					he may think:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This wealth is growing,<br />
					and I am one who grows his wealth for righteous reasons.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way he will have protected himself from worry from either cause.</p>
