					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Pacc'avekkhaṇā-nimitta: (paṭi+avekkhati)</i> reflect-observation. Observing the signs is not seen elsewhere connected with <i>sammā samādhi</i> or the mastery of higher powers and it's meaning here is subject to question. There is no support in the sutta itself for the idea that this is paying attention to a concentration device, or the so called 'reflex image,' or to the subject of one's meditation. I believe the key is in the simile which is of a man observing another man while standing, observing while standing another man who is sitting, and sitting observing another man who is lying down. I believe what is being observed is one's state of serenity and that there is, in the idea of 'a man', a symbolic imagry for mnemonic purposes which is humorous. Note that the final, always the highest state, is supine.<br />
					However to cover one's bets also take this to mean the signs or mile-stones identifying stages in ones mastery of a subject of meditation (not attention to the kasina or subject propper). Further, the 'subject' can be a kasina, but is not limited to the kasinas; it can be a subject like the emptiness meditation, the idea of the repulsive, the idea of death, etc. Generally we are not aware of the vast amount of information we receive and promptly forget. The idea here would be to make conscious the various stages one progresses through so that it is not necessary to develop them anew at each meditation session.</p>
