					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>Some things should be kept in mind when thinking over and pondering the meaning of this sutta while in the first <i>jhāna:</i> The <i>Nivaraṇas</i> are not 'obstructions', they are 'diversions'. The simile [see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p51">AN 5.51</a>] is of something that is diverting, not obstructing, the forward momentum of a stream. Then think about the fact that that which obstructs does not involve the will of the individual or necessarily reduce his strength, whereas diversions are by their nature participated in by the individual and weaken his strength and diminish his individual willpower. The point is the need to take responsibility. Don Juan would call these 'self-indulgences'. Thinking this way of the <i>nivaraṇa</i> one has allowed the possibility of their removal by putting them under the control of the individual. Obstructions come from the outside and their appearance cannot be controlled, diversions are self-created and can be abstained from. No action required. Just not-doing. The trick is to be fast enough to see where one is, one's self, allowing the mind to become diverted from the goal.</p>
