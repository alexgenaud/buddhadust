					revisiting the Sakyans,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#Kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a><br />
					Nigrodhā's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also at this time<br />
					Mahānāma the Sakkyan<br />
					had just emerged from sickness,<br />
					not long emerged from sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also at this time<br />
					many beggars were at work<br />
					making robes for The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The robes being finished," they said,<br />
					"The Lucky Man will go on his three months tour."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma the Sakkyan came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">Many beggars are at work<br />
					making robes for The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The robes being finished," they are saying,<br />
					"The Lucky Man will go on his three months tour."</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Mahānāma the Sakkyan<br />
					went to where The Lucky Man was located,<br />
					where he drew near and<br />
					having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />
					Mahānāma the Sakkyan said this<br />
					to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, <i>Bhante,</I><br />
					that many beggars are at work<br />
					making robes for The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The robes being finished," they are saying,<br />
					"The Lucky Man will go on his three months tour."'</p>

					<p class="f4">In that diverse residence, <i>Bhante</i><br />
					in which we reside<br />
					in whose residence<br />
					should we reside?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">You reflect good form<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup><br />
					when you sons of clans<br />
					approach the <i>Tathāgata</i> and ask:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In that diverse residence, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					in which we reside<br />
					in whose residence<br />
					should we reside?'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in faith, then Mahānāma,<br />
					not that of the faithless<br />
					in that of the accomplished in energy,<br />
					not in that of the indolent,<br />
					in that of the accomplished in setting up the mind,<br />
					not that of the absent-minded.<br />
					in that of the accomplished in composure,<br />
					not that of the confused,<br />
					in that of the accomplished in wisdom,<br />
					not that of the stupid.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Mahānāma, these five things set up,<br />
					six further things should be developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is truly the Lucky Man,<br />
					aristocrat,<br />
					The Consummately Self-Awakened,<br />
					accomplished in vision and conduct,<br />
					The Welcome One,<br />
					knower of the world,<br />
					unsurpassed coachman of trainable men,<br />
					Master of gods and men,<br />
					The Awakened One,<br />
					The Lucky Man</p>

					<p class="f4">At which time, Mahānāma,<br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					recollects the Tathāgata<br />
					not at that time does<br />
					lust obsess the heart,<br />
					nor does anger obsess the heart,<br />
					nor does confusion obsess the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time<br />
					the heart walks tall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Mahānāma,<br />
					with heart walking tall,<br />
					setting out from the Tathāgata,<br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					gains the thrill of attainment,<br />
					gains the thrill of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					gains possession of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					knowing gladness,<br />
					being pleased,<br />
					enthusiastic.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enthusiastic in mind,<br />
					the body becomes impassive<br />
					impassive in body<br />
					pleasure is experienced<br />
					pleased,<br />
					the heart is serene.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma,<br />
					this recollection of the Awakened One<br />
					should be developed when going along,<br />
					should be developed when standing,<br />
					should be developed when sitting,<br />
					should be developed when lying down,<br />
					should be developed when supervising your works<br />
					should be developed when at rest among your family.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect the <i>Dhamma:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">'Well-preached by The Lucky Man<br />
					is the <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					to be seen for one's self,<br />
					outside of Time,<br />
					a 'come see' thing,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be experienced for himself<br />
					by the learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">At which time, Mahānāma,<br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					recollects the <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					not at that time does<br />
					lust obsess the heart,<br />
					nor does anger obsess the heart,<br />
					nor does confusion obsess the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time<br />
					the heart walks tall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Mahānāma,<br />
					with heart walking tall,<br />
					setting out from the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					gains the thrill of attainment,<br />
					gains the thrill of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					gains possession of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					knowing gladness,<br />
					being pleased,<br />

					<p class="f4">Enthusiastic in mind,<br />
					the body becomes impassive<br />
					impassive in body<br />
					pleasure is experienced<br />
					pleased,<br />
					the heart is serene.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma,<br />
					this recollection of the <i>Dhamma</i><br />

					should be developed when at rest among your family.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect the <i>Saṇgha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Practicing well<br />
					is The Lucky Man's <i>Saṇgha</i> of followers<br />
					practicing uprightly<br />
					is The Lucky Man's <i>Saṇgha</i> of followers<br />
					practicing according to method<br />
					is The Lucky Man's <i>Saṇgha</i> of followers<br />
					practicing consummately<br />
					is The Lucky Man's <i>Saṇgha</i> of followers<br />
					that is,<br />
					the four pairs of persons,<br />
					the eight individual-persons.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is The Lucky Man's <i>Saṇgha</i><br />
					deserving of offerings<br />
					worthy of veneration<br />
					worthy of the right hand salute<br />
					unsurpassed field for merit in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">At which time, Mahānāma,<br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					recollects the <i>Saṇgha</i><br />
					not at that time does<br />

					nor does anger obsess the heart,<br />
					nor does confusion obsess the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time<br />
					the heart walks tall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Mahānāma,<br />
					with heart walking tall,<br />
					setting out from the <i>Saṇgha,</i><br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					gains the thrill of attainment,<br />
					gains the thrill of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					gains possession of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />

					impassive in body<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma,<br />

					should be developed when standing,<br />
					should be developed when sitting,<br />

					should be developed when at rest among your family.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect your ethical standards:</p>

					<p class="f4">Unbroken<br />
					uncorrupted<br />
					consistent<br />
					untarnished<br />
					untrammeled<br />
					unperverted<br />
					unadulterated<br />
					evolving into serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">At which time, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">At such time<br />
					the heart walks tall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Mahānāma,<br />
					with heart walking tall,<br />
					setting out from ethics,<br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					gains the thrill of attainment,<br />
					gains the thrill of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect your liberality:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is truly a gain for me,<br />
					it is truly well-gained by me,<br />
					that in this world<br />
					obsessed by the stingy grip of greed,<br />
					I inhabit my home<br />

					freely giving,<br />
					open-handed,<br />
					delighting in letting go,<br />
					taking delight in<br />
					liberally dispensing gifts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At which time, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect the gods:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are gods of the Four Great Kings,<br />
					there are gods of the Three and Thirty,<br />
					there are Yama gods,<br />
					there are gods of Delight,<br />
					there are gods that delight in creation,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such as was the form of faith<br />

					<p class="f4">Such as was the form of ethics<br />
