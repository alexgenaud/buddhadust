					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This sutta has no <i>Nidana,</i> but it is hard not to see that this sutta belongs with the previous two.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> "failing to have" and "missing" in Woodward is "has lost" and "lacks basis"; in Bhikkhu Bodhi it is "deficient in" and "lacks its proximate cause"; the <i>Pāḷi</i> is <i>"vipannassa"</i> and <i>"hata."</i> In PED <i>"vipannassa"</i> would support "has lost" as well as "failing to have" and "being deficient in" but the sutta could then imply that these things were had at an earlier point and were subsequently lost. In PED <i>"hata"</i> can mean "destroyed" as well as "missing" and "lack". For the "has lost" and "destroyed" meaning to make sense in English, it needs to have an "or" between the initial "being without" and the "having lost". But that might not be required in the <i>Pāḷi.</i> What could be being spoken of is having attained and subsequently having lost because the basis has been destroyed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>  <i>Sammā-samādhi.</i> ("consummate serenity" which is defined as the four <i>jhānas</i>) where in the previous two it was only <i>samādhi</i> (just "serenity" which is understood to be the entire system). I would only point out that <i>samādhi</i> in the previous two was to be looked for, established in, or a property of the heart, whereas the location (or characteristic) for <i>jhāna</i> here (and elsewhere) is not specified.</p>
