					<p class="f4">There then many beggars<br />

					having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />

					<p class="f4">"For us <i>bhante,</i> things are best resorted to<br />

					<p class="f4">It would be good, <i>bhante,</i><br />

					<p class="f4">"Then give ear, beggars,<br />
					Pay good attention!<br />
					I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, the beggars saying<br />
					"Even so, bhante!"<br />
					in response,<br />
					the Lucky Man said this to them:</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">"It is, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But just how, <i>bhante,</i> is it<br />

					<p class="f4">"Here beggars, a beggar has this perception:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is it!<br />
