<meta name="description" content="The M. Olds translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Elevens, Sutta 7. The Buddha explains how it can be that a monk's winning of serenity (samadhi) may be of such a sort that he is not, even in the midst of earth, percepient of earth, nor is he, in the midst of water, percepient of water, nor in the midst of firelight, percepient of firelight, nor in the midst of wind, percepient of wind, nor in the midst of The Realm Space, percepient of The Realm Space, nor in the midst of The Realm Consciousness, percepient of The Realm Consciousness, nor in the midst of The Realm No-Things-There, percepient of The Realm No-Things-There, nor in the midst of The Realm of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception, percepient of The Realm of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception, nor in the midst of This world, percepient of This world, nor in the midst of The World Beyond, percepient of The World Beyond, nor in the midst of The Seen, Heard, Sensed, Known, percepient of The Seen, Heard, Sensed, Known, nor in the midst of the attained, the saught-after, the explored in mind, percepient of the attained, the saught-after, the explored in mind — that of such he has no perception and yet he is perceiving." />
