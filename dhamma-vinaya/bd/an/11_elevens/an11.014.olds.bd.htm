					revisiting the Sakyans,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#Kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a><br />
					Nigrodhā's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, at this time,<br />
					The Lucky Man desired to<br />
					enter upon the rains residence<br />
					in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#Sāvatthi">Sāvatthi.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakkyan heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lucky Man desires<br />
					enter upon the rains residence<br />
					in Sāvatthi."</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Nandiya the Sakkyan<br />
					thought to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What if I also now<br />
					spend the rains<br />
					in Sāvitthi?</p>

					<p class="f4">I would be able<br />
					to supervise my business,<br />
					and would get to see The Lucky Man<br />
					from time to time."</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man<br />
					entered the rains residence<br />
					in Sāvatthi, and<br />
					Nandiya the Sakkyan too<br />
					spent the rains<br />
					in Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he was able<br />
					to supervise his business, and<br />
					got to see The Lucky Man<br />
					from time to time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, at this time,<br />
					many beggars were at work<br />
					making robes for The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The robes being finished," they said,<br />
					"The Lucky Man will go on his three months tour."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nandiya the Sakkyan came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">Many beggars are at work<br />
					making robes for The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The robes being finished," they are saying,<br />
					"The Lucky Man will go on his three months tour."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then and there Nandiya the Sakkyan<br />
					went to where The Lucky Man was located,<br />
					drew near and<br />
					having drawn near,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />
					Nandiya the Sakkyan said this<br />
					to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, <i>Bhante,</I><br />
					that many beggars are at work<br />
					making robes for The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The robes being finished,' they are saying,<br />
					'The Lucky Man will go on his three months tour.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In that diverse residence, <i>Bhante</i><br />
					in which we reside<br />
					in whose residence<br />
					should we reside?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, Nandiya.</p>

					<p class="f4">You reflect good form<br />
					when you sons of clans<br />
					approach the <i>Tathāgata</i> and ask:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In that diverse residence, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					in which we reside<br />
					in whose residence<br />
					should we reside?'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in faith, then Nandiya,<br />
					not that of the faithless.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in ethics,<br />
					not in that of those without ethics.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in energy,<br />
					not in that of the indolent.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in setting up the mind,<br />
					not that of the absent-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in composure,<br />
					not that of the confused.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that of the accomplished in wisdom,<br />
					not that of the stupid.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Nandiya, these six things set up,<br />
					five further things should be developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Nandiya,<br />
					you should recollect the <i>Tathāgata:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">'He is truly the Lucky Man,<br />
					aristocrat,<br />
					The Consummately Self-Awakened,<br />
					accomplished in vision and conduct,<br />
					The Welcome One,<br />
					knower of the world,<br />
					unsurpassed coachman of trainable men,<br />
					Master of gods and men,<br />
					The Awakened One,<br />
					The Lucky Man.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is then, Nandiya,<br />
					that starting out from the <i>Tathāgata,</i><br />
					you set up the personal mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Nandiya,<br />
					you should recollect the <i>Dhamma:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">'Well-preached by The Lucky Man<br />
					is the <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					to be seen for one's self,<br />
					outside of Time,<br />
					a 'come see' thing,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be experienced for himself<br />
					by the learned.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is then, Nandiya,<br />
					that starting out from the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					you set up the personal mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Nandiya,<br />
					you should recollect the good friend:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is truly a gain for me,<br />
					it is truly well-gained by me,<br />
					for me to have a good friend<br />
					who is empathetic,<br />
					desiring my benefit,<br />
					an advisor,<br />
					a mentor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is then, Nandiya,<br />
					that starting out from the good friend<br />
					you set up the personal mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Nandiya,<br />
					you should recollect your liberality:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is truly a gain for me,<br />
					it is truly well-gained by me,<br />
					that in this world<br />
					obsessed by the stingy grip of greed,<br />
					I inhabit my home<br />
					with a heart without<br />
					the grip of greed,<br />
					freely giving,<br />
					open-handed,<br />
					delighting in letting go,<br />
					taking delight in<br />
					liberally dispensing gifts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is then, Nandiya,<br />
					that starting out from your liberality<br />
					you set up the personal mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, after that, Nandiya,<br />
					you should recollect the gods:</p>

					<p class="f4">'whatever gods that pass beyond<br />
					companionship with the gods that eat solid food,<br />
					reborn with some sort of mind-made body,<br />
					these, do not see in themselves<br />
					the heaping up of that which needs to be done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Nandiya,<br />
					a beggar, freed as to thing of time,<br />
					does not see<br />
					that which needs to be done, or<br />
					heaping up of selves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Nandiya,<br />
					whatever gods that pass beyond<br />
					companionship with the gods that eat solid food,<br />
					reborn with some sort of mind-made body,<br />
					these, do not see in themselves<br />
					the heaping up of that which needs to be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is then, Nandiya,<br />
					that starting out from the gods<br />
					you set up the personal mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Nandiya,<br />
					that possessed of these eleven <i>Dhammas</i><br />
					the student of the aristocrats
					gets rid of,<br />
					does not grasp after,<br />
					bad, unskillful things.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Nandiya,<br />
					as an overturned pot<br />
					does take back the water<br />
					it has spilled out;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Nandiya,<br />
					as a dry grass jungle fire<br />
					burns forward,<br />
					does not return<br />
					to what has already been burnt;</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Nandiya,<br />
					possessed of these eleven <i>Dhammas</i><br />
					the student of the aristocrats<br />
					gets rid of,<br />
					does not grasp after,<br />
					bad, unskillful things."</p>
