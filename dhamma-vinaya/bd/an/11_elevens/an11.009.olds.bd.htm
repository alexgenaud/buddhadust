					<p class="f4">There then Old-man<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda came to <i>Bhagava,</i> drawing near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near and giving salutation,<br />

					not thinking of earth,<br />
					not thinking of water,<br />
					not thinking of firelight,<br />
					not thinking of wind,
					not thinking of The Realm Space,<br />
					not thinking of The Realm of Consciousness,<br />
					not thinking of The Realm of No-Things-to-be-Had-There,<br />
					not thinking of The Realm of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But just how, <i>bhante,</i> is it<br />
					that a beggar acquires<br />

					<p class="f4">"Here Ānanda, a beggar has this perception:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is it!<br />

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Ānanda,<br />
