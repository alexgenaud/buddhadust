					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Mūlakā</i> Literally root; foot, basis, foundation, remuneration (pay = support). Here of <i>sabbe dhammā</i> (all things), compare with <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#1">MN 1</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Sambhavā</i> This may be the point of origin, but the word does not mean origin. Literally it is 'com-becoming', or 'com-existing', or 'com-living'. It means the coming together of what is one's own with that which is other that makes a living being, an individual, or that which is personal existence, or owned. Hint: the word also means 'semen viril'. And that is a good illustration of the meaning. But here we are talking about 'all things', not just living beings, and that which is the co-becoming of all things is work of mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>  <i>Adhipateyya.</i> PED has: "probably misreading for <i>ādhipateyya.</i>" [<i>Ādhipacca:</i> supreme rule, lordship, sovereignty, power] <i>Childers:</i> Influence, rule, supremacy. There are three <i>adhipatteyyas</i> or influences that induce men to follow virtue: <i>Attādhipateyyaɱ,</i> "the influence of self," that is, self-respect orride; <i>Lokādhipateyyaɱ,</i> "the influence of the world,' that is, dread of censure, and <i>Dhammādhipateyyaḍɱ,</i> "the influence of religion," or thelove of virtue for its own sake.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Uttarā<sup>2</sup>.</i> PED: [from uttarati] crossing over, to be crossed. &gt; <i>Uttaraṇa</i> (nt.) [from <i>uttarati</i>] bringing or moving out, saving, delivery.</p>

					<p class="in2">See also: <a href="../10_tens/an10.058.olds.bd.htm">AN 10.58</a> where I translate some terms differently. I think my previous choices are not incorrect, but I think the better choice, and coming closer to the Pali, is with this sutta. I think it is incorrect to say 'Rooted in Bhagava'. The Bhikkhus are saying 'we are (our views are) rooted in Bhagava', not 'things' or 'all things' are rooted in Bhagava.</p>
