					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man, Sāvatthi Town, Anāthapiṇḍika Park, Jeta Grove came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, to the Beggars gathered round he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And, "Broke Tooth!" they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars, upholding the eight-dimensional day of preparation is very fruitful,<br />
					a thing casting a great, widespread radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Beggars, does one uphold the eight-dimensional day of preparation<br />
					so that it is very fruitful,<br />
					a thing casting a great, widespread radiance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats reflects to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long,<br />
					the Arahants let go of, and live abstaining from harm to breathing things;<br />
					repelled by harm to breathing things,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					they put down stick and sword<br />
					and live in friendliness,<br />
					for the benefit of all beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will let go of<br />
					and live abstaining from harm to breathing things;<br />
					repelled by harm to breathing things,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					I will put down stick and sword<br />
					and live in friendliness<br />
					for the benefit of all beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, beggars,<br />
					one upholds the first dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants let go of,<br />
					and live abstaining from taking that which is not given;<br />
					repelled by theft,<br />
					they put down taking the ungiven,<br />
					depending on the given<br />
					they live clean handed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will live abstaining from taking that which is not given;<br />
					repelled by theft,<br />
					putting down taking the ungiven,<br />
					depending on the given,<br />
					I will live clean-handed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way too I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, beggars,<br />
					one upholds the second dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants let go of,<br />
					and live abstaining from ungodlike conduct,<br />
					carrying themselves like gods,<br />
					they abstain from sex and family life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will let go of<br />
					and live abstaining from un godlike conduct,<br />
					carrying myself like god,<br />
					I will abstain from sex<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup><br />
					and family life.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way too I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, Beggars,<br />
					one upholds the third dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants let go of,<br />
					and live abstaining from deceitful speech,<br />
					repelled by deceitful speech,<br />
					truthful,<br />
					they stick to the truth,<br />
					they rely on the truth,<br />
					they keep their word to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will live abstaining from deceitful speech,<br />
					repelled by deceitful speech,<br />
					truthful,<br />
					I will stick to the truth,<br />

					<p class="f4">In this way too I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, Beggars,<br />
					one upholds the fourth dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants let go of,<br />
					and live abstaining from the carelessness caused by narcotic drinks,<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup><br />
					repelled by the carelessness caused by narcotic drinks<br />
					they abstain from the carelessness caused by narcotic drinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will let go of,<br />
					and live abstaining from the carelessness caused by narcotic drinks,<br />
					repelled by the carelessness caused by narcotic drinks<br />
					I will abstain from the carelessness caused by narcotic drinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way too I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, Beggars,<br />
					one upholds the fifth dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants eat one-meal a day,<br />
					not eating at night<br />
					abstaining from eating at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will eat only one meal,<br />
					not eating at night,<br />
					abstaining from eating at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way too I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, Beggars,<br />
					one upholds the sixth dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants abstain from indulging in dancing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and playing music<sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup>;<br />
					looking at shows;<br />
					wearing garlands<br />
					or adorning and ornamenting themselves with garlands,<br />
					ointments<br />
					and perfumes;<br />
					repelled by such things,<br />
					they abstain from such things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will abstain from indulging in dancing,<br />

					<p class="f4">In this way too I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the day of preparation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, Beggars,<br />
					one upholds the seventh dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All life long<br />
					the Arahants abstain from using high and broad beds,<br />
					repelled by high and broad beds,<br />
					they lie down on low beds,<br />
					proper beds,<br />
					such as a grass mat.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will abstain from using a high and broad bed,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the way, Beggars,<br />
					one upholds the eighth dimension<br />
					of the day of preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, Upholding The Eight-Dimensional day of preparation in this way<br />
					is very fruitful,<br />
					a thing casting a great, widespread radiance."</p>
