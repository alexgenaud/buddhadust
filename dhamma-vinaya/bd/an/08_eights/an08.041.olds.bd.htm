					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man, Sāvatthi Town, Anāthapiṇḍika Park, Jeta Grove came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, to the Beggars gathered round he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Broke Tooth! they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, Upholding The Eight-Dimensional Day of Preparation is very fruitful,<br />
					a thing casting a great, widespread radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Beggars, does one uphold the Eight-Dimensional Day of Preparation<br />
					so that it is very fruitful,<br />
					a thing casting a great, widespread radiance?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Beggars, the student of the Aristocrats reflects to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"All life long,<br />
					the Arahants let go of, and live abstaining from harm to breathing things;<br />
					repelled by harm to breathing things,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					they put down stick and sword<br />
					and live in friendliness,<br />
					for the benefit of all beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">This night and day, then,<br />
					I too will let go of<br />
					and live abstaining from harm to breathing things;<br />
					repelled by harm to breathing things,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					I will put down stick and sword<br />
					and live in friendliness<br />
					for the benefit of all beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way I will follow the example of the Arahants<br />
					and keep the Day of Preparation."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, beggars,<br />
					one upholds the first dimension<br />
					of the Day of Preparation.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Beggars, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">"All life long<br />
					the Arahants let go of,<br />

					repelled by theft,<br />
					they put down taking the ungiven,<br />
