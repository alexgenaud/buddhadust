<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya, Eights, Sutta 63. A bhikkhu asks for a lesson 'in brief' and gets a lesson in detail. A truly unique sutta which leads to arahantship by a complex mixing of the four brahma viharas, and samādhi practice in the context of satipatthana training. A good sutta to break up the rigid understanding of samādhi and satipaṭṭhana practice." />

					<p class="f4">"It would be well for me, <i>bhante,</i><br />
					if the <i>Bhagavā</i> would teach a condensed <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
