					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#bhagga">Bhagga-land</a> revisiting,<br />
					Crock-mount,<br />
					the Deer-Park of Medicine-man's-woods<br />
					while also at that time the Elder <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was residing among the <a href="http://localhost/themozone/bd/backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#ceti">Cetis,</a><br />
					in Eastern Bamboo Woods.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then in the private reflections of Elder Anuruddho<br />
					there arose in his heart these thoughts:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A thing<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> for those who are of small<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> wishes, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those of great wishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who are contented, this is,<br />
					<a id="pt229" href="../../../pali/an/08_eights/an08.030.pali.bd.htm#pg229"><span class="f2">[229]</span></a> not a thing for those of discontentment.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who are retiring, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those who take pleasure in community.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who seize at energy, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those who are cozy.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who have set up mind, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those who are absent-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who are serene, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those who are not serene.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for the wise, this is,<br />
					not a thing for the stupid."</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man,<br />
					knowing by his heart the thoughts<br />
					in the heart of the elder Anuruddha,<br />
					like a strong man stretching out his bent arm,<br />
					or bending back his outstretched arm,<br />
					vanishing from Bhagga-land, Crock-mount,<br />
					the Deer-Park of Medicine-man's-woods,<br />
					reappearing in Ceti-land, Eastern Bamboo Woods<br />
					facing the elder Anuruddha,<br />
					sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then the Elder Anuruddha saluted and took a seat to one side.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lucky Man said this to the elder Anuruddha seated to one side:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done Anuruddha!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well have you, Anuruddha,<br />
					thought the seven thoughts of the great man:</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who are of small wishes, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those of great wishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who are contented, this is,<br />

					not a thing for those who are cozy.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who have set up mind, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those who are absent-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for those who are serene, this is,<br />
					not a thing for those who are not serene.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for the wise, this is,<br />
					not a thing for the stupid.</p>

					<p class="f4">From there Anuruddha,<br />
					think over this eighth thought of a great man:</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing for the undistracted, this is,<br />
					for one loving the undistracted,<br />

					<p class="f4">This indeed being so, Anuruddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so bhante" replied the elder Anuruddha to the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man,<br />

					Bhagava said:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dhamma.</i> 'Form' in accordance with the practice of this system.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Not 'few' as per <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi. Bhk. Thanissaro has the sense, but his 'modest' and 'self-aggrandizing' is an explanation, not a translation. Hare's translation is closer but all miss the fact that the meaning is defined below when the Buddha gives as examples: A small wish is one which is focused on one's own attainments, a great wish is one which is focused on fame for such attainment. And <i>'iccha'</i> is better as 'wish'. We have too many words being translated 'desire'!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> It was not polite to sit directly in front of someone: "to confront." The seat should be close enough to allow touching with the outstretched arm.</p>

There is a secondary meaning of <i>Kaṅkha</i> meaning to wish, but that would make the meaning 'to not wish to' or any time you didn't wish to. I don't see how any of these translations are arrived at. But what is the meaning of <i>"yāva-d-eva ākaṅkhissasi'</i> 'as long as you are thus without doubt'? I suggest it means that as long as one is coasting along on these eight thoughts without doubt as to their soundness one is in such a state of confidence that higher states of consciousness are easily attained, but that the opposite is also true, that when such a state of confidence is lacking, attaining these higher states will be difficult.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Pūtimutta.</i> Putrid-urine. Amonia. Usually from cows.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Paṭicca.</i> This use sheds light on the intended meaning in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda.</i> Essentially 'a thing resulting from.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Titthiyā.</i> To define one <i>Pāḷi</i> word with another that happens to be current here. It means one who sets up satisfaction in others, or one who guides others across, but was understood to mean teachers of other disciplines.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>añña-datthu uyyojanika-paṭisaṃyuttaṃ yeva kathaṃ kattā hoti.</i> A controversial line centering on the two possible meanings of <i>'uyyojanika':</i> <i>'uyyo: ud+ya + jati'</i> 'up-whatever jump (born this)'; PED: 1. to instigate, and 2. to dismiss or take leave. I am here opting for the more compassionate view. However, from experience, talk about giving up, renunciation, etc. invariably results in people loosing interest and taking leave with the result that one quickly finds the desired solitude. Bhk. Bodhi: 'entirely confines his talk to the subject of going apart.' Hare: 'a talk invariably concerned with dismissing them'; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: 'he converses with them only as much is necessary for them to take their leave'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Deeper, I think, than my/the usual: "remembers things said and done long ago". It means to be able, as well as to remember, to follow, placing in context, a thought that is recollected. One of the criteria considered in recognizing growth in a person is whether or not they are able to explain their past movements as well as simply remembering them. "I did this because I was thinking this way, had this feeling resulting from this contact, etc."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Saṅkappa.</i> Not 'thoughts' <i>('vitakka')</i> as with <i>Bhks.</i> Thanissaro and Bhodi. <i>Saṇ:</i> own-; <i>kappa:</i> fit and proppa. I usually translate "principles." Others usually translate 'intentions', 'aims.' <i>Sammā Saṅkappa</i> is departure, abandoning, letting go; to abstain from inflicting mental pain; and to abstain from inflicting physical pain = violence. Principles. Things that are fit and proper for one who is following the Four Truths, or "High View."</p>
