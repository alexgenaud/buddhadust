					Crock-mount,<br />
					the Deer-Park of Medicine-man's-woods<br />
					while also at that time the Elder <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was residing among the <a href="http://localhost/themozone/bd/backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#ceti">Cetis,</a><br />

					<p class="f4">There then in the private reflections of Elder Anuruddho<br />
					there arose in his heart these thoughts:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A thing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> for those who are of small<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> wishes, this is,<br />

					<p class="f4">2. There then The Lucky Man,<br />

					in the heart of the elder Anuruddha,<br />
					like a strong man stretching out his bent arm,<br />

					vanishing from Bhagga-land, Crock-mount,<br />
					the Deer-Park of Medicine-man's-woods,<br />
					reappearing in Ceti-land, Eastern Bamboo Woods<br />

					<p class="f4">And then the Elder Anuruddha saluted and took a seat to one side.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Luck Man said this to the elder Anuruddha seated to one side:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dhamma.</i> 'Form' in accordance with the practice of this system.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Not 'few' as per Bhk. Bodhi. Bhk. Thanissaro has the sense, but his  'modest' and 'self-aggrandizing' is an explanation, not a translation. Hare's translation is closer but all miss the fact that the meaning is defined below when the Buddha gives as examples: A small wish is one which is focused on one's own attainments, a great wish is one which is focused on fame for such attainment. And <i>'iccha'</i> is better as 'wish'. We have too many words being translated 'desire.'!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> It was not polite to sit directly in front of someone: "to confront." The seat should be close enough to allow touching with the outstretched arm.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Ākaŋkhi.</i> not doubting, without doubt. Bhk. Bodhi: 'as much as you wish'; Hare: 'you may, an [if] you will'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'whenever you want'. There is a secondary meaning of <i>Kaŋkha</i> meaning to wish, but that would make the meaning 'to not wish to' or any time you didn't wish to. I don't see how any of these translations are arrived at. But what is the meaning of <i>"yāva-d-eva ākaŋkhissasi'</i> 'as long as you are thus without doubt'? I suggest it means that as long as one is coasting along on these eight thoughts without doubt as to their soundness one is in such a state of confidence that higher states of consciousness are easily attained, but that the opposite is also true, that when such a state of confidence is lacking, attaining these higher states will be difficult.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Pūtimutta.</i> Putrid-urine. Amonia. Usually from cows.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Paṭicca.</i> This use sheds light on the intended meaning in the Paticca Samuppada. Essentially 'a thing resulting from.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Titthiyā.</i> To define one Pali word with another that happens to be current here. It means one who sets up satisfaction in others, or one who guides others across, but was understood to mean teachers of other disciplines.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>aññadatthu uyyojanika-paṭisaɱyuttaɱ yeva kathaɱ kattā hoti.</i> A controversial line centering on the two possible meanings of <i>'uyyojanika':</i> <i>'uyyo: ud+ya + jati'</i> 'up-whatever jump (born this)'; PED: 1. to instigate, and 2. to dismiss or take leave. I am here opting for the more compassionate view. However, from experience, talk about giving up, renunciation, etc. inveriably results in people loosing interest and taking leave with the result that one quickly finds the desired solitude. Bhk. Bodhi: 'entirely confines his talk to the subject of going apart.' Hare:
					'a talk invariably concerned with dismissing them'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'he converses with them only as much is necessary for them to take their leave'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Anikkhittadhuro.</i> Really: Not-putting down-yoke.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Deeper, I think, than my/the usual: "remembers things said and done long ago". It means to be able, as well as to remember, to follow, placing in context, a thought that is recollected. One of the criteria considered in recognizing growth in a person is whether or not they are able to explain their past movements as well as simply remembering them. "I did this because I was thinking this way, had this feeling resulting from this contact, etc."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Saŋkappa.</i> Not 'thoughts' <i>('vitakka')</i> as with Bhks. Thanissaro and Bhodi. <i>saŋ</i>: own-; <i>kappa:</i> fit and proppa. I usually translate "principles." Others usually translate 'intentions', 'aims.' <i>Sammā Saŋkappa</i> is departure, abandoning, letting go; to abstain from inflicting mental pain; and to abstain from inflicting physical pain = violence. Principles. Things that are fit and proper for one who is following the Four Truths, or "High View."</p>
