					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#alavi">Āḷavi-town,</a> Aggālave shrine revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/hatthako_alavako.htm">Hatthaka Āḷavaka</a> surrounded by Upāsakas,<br />
					some five-hundred by count,<br />
					approached the Lucky Man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having approached and given salutation,<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When they were seated to one side then<br />
					The Lucky Man said this to Hatthaka Āḷavaka:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">2. "Great, indeed, Hatthaka, is your company!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How, Hatthaka, did you gather together<br />
					this great company of yours?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, bhante, by way of<br />
					these four gathering-tactics<br />
					taught by the Lucky Man<br />
					that I have gathered this company:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I, bhante, knowing:<br />
					"This, gifts will gather in,"<br />
					— he by gifts I gather in.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing such:<br />
					"This, kind words will gather in,"<br />
					— he by kind words I gather in.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing such:<br />
					"This, helpfulness will gather in,"<br />
					— he by my being helpful I gather in.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing such:<br />
					"This, impartiality will gather in,"<br />
					— he by impartiality I gather in.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, bhante,<br />
					there is immense wealth found in my family<br />
					no one thinks to listen to one impoverished.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">3. Well-said, well-said, Hatthaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the very way to begin, Hatthaka,<br />
					the gathering of a great company.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whomsoever, Hatthaka, during the past,<br />
					gathered a company<br />
					all such did so with these same four gathering-tactics<br />
					for gathereing a great company.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whomsoever, Hatthaka, during the future,<br />
					will gather a company<br />
					all such will do so with these same four gathering-tactics<br />
					for gathereing a great company.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whomsoever, Hatthaka, presently,<br />
					gathers a company<br />
					all such do so with these same four gathering-tactics<br />
					for gathereing a great company.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					instructed, made enthusiastic, aroused, convinced<br />
					by Dhamma-talk from the Lucky Man,<br />
					rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted,<br />
					and keeping the Lucky Man to his right,<br />
					departed.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Lucky man<br />
					not long after the departure of Hatthaka Āḷavaka<br />
					addressed the beggars:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Bear in mind, beggars, these eight wonderful and marvelous things<br />
					possessed by Hatthaka Āḷavaka.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">6. Convinced, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					virtuous, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					possessed of a sense of shame, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					possessed of fear of blame, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					well-read, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					generous, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					wise, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka,<br />
					modest, beggars, is Hatthaka Āḷavaka.</p> 

					<p class="f4">"These are, beggars, the eight wonderful and marvelous things<br />
					possessed by Hatthaka Āḷavaka<br />
					which should be born in mind."</p>
