					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man, Sāvatthi Town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, to the Beggars gathered round he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding, <i>"Bhante!"</i> the Lucky Man said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Fear', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'pain', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'sickness', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'a cancer', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'a stabbing', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'relations', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'a mire', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality;<br />
					'a womb', beggars, is a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'fear' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from fear in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from fear in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'fear' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'pain' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from pain in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from pain in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'pain' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'sickness' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from sickness in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from sickness in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'sickness' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'a cancer' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from cancer in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released cancer in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'a cancer' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'a stab' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from being stabbed in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from being stabbed in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'a stab' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'relations' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from relations in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from relations in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'relations' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'the mire' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from the mire in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from the mire in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'the mire' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, beggars, is 'the womb' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever is impassioned by lust for sensuality,<br />
					bound by lustful wishing,<br />
					is not even released from the womb in this visible thing,<br />
					is certainly not released from the womb in his future states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is 'the womb' a deeper way of speaking of sensuality."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Fear, pain, sickness,<br />
					      and a cancer,<br />
					      relations, a mire and a womb — each<br />
					      'sensuality' are called —<br />
					      as common people<br />
					      beset by forms delightful,<br />
					      further wombs beget.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">But when a beggar, ardent,<br />
							self-awareness not neglecting,<br />
					      this painful mired-path surpasses,<br />
					     	a people quaking at birth and aging<br />
					     	is what he sees there.</p>
