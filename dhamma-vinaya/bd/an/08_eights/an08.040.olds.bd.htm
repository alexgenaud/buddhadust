					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There is no <i>Nidana</i> for this specific sutta. The nearest previous <i>Nidana</i> is for sutta 30 which is used here. It is likely this sutta was originally delivered with all those previous to this point as one sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup><i>Pāṇ-ā-tipāta. Pāṇa-a-tipāta. pāṇa:</i> PED: [from <i>pa + an,</i> cp. Vedic <i>prāṇa</i> breath of life; <i>Pāli apāna,</i> etc.] living being, life, creature; <i>tipāta:</i> not in PED. ?&gt; PED: <i>Tippa</i> (adj.) [a variant of <i>tibba</i> = Sanskrit <i>tīvra,</i> presumably from <i>tij</i> (cp. <i>tikhiṇa</i>), but by Bdhgh connected w. <i>tap</i> (<i>tapati,</i> burn) ... piercing, sharp, acute, fierce; always and only with reference to pains, esp. pains suffered in <i>Niraya;</i> or PED: <i>Pātana</i> (nt.) [from <i>pāteti</i>] bringing to fall, destroying, killing, only in <i>gabbha-</i> destroying the foetus, abortion (q.v.) DhA I.47 and passim.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Niraya-saṃvattaniko.</i> Hell-one-(serves, delivers)-down to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup><i>Sabba-lahuso.</i> All-lightly. Very light. Insignificant. Here 'comparatively'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Adinn-ā-dānaṃ. Adinn'ādāna.</i> Not-gift-un-giving. Not-gift-taking. Taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Bhoga-vyasana. Bhoga:</i> wealth; <i>vyasana:</i> misfortune.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Kāmesu micchā-cāro.</i> Pleasure's mis-behavior. <i>Micchā</i> &gt; piss- mis- mictorate, low, contrary. Contrasted with <i>'Sammā'</i> High. Usually mistranslated Wrong vs. Right. Misbehavior in pleasures usually means having sexual intercourse with protected women: another man's wife, a child, a young girl still living with her parents, a girl that is engaged to be married, a girl 'belonging' to a powerful individual or protected by the state. <i>Cara:</i> carry on &gt; car, cart, cargo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Verasapatta. Vera:</i> hatred; <i>Sapatta:</i> enmity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Musāvādo.</i> Lying speech. Telling lies. PED: <i>Musati:</i> to betray, beguile, bewilder, dazzle; <i>Vada:</i> speech. This includes the practice we see today in representatives of the CIA and other government representatives where what is said is technically true but intended to mislead. e.g., setting up two programs both of which are identical and then disbanding one. When the program is exposed as illegal the representative states that 'Yes, we had such a program, but it was disbanded.' Why 'deception' is used here as opposed to 'lying'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Abhūta-byākkhāna. Akkhāna:</i> telling stories, tales; <i>Akkhāti:</i> to tell, declare, announce; <i>Abhūta:</i> 'not is' <i>a:</i> not; (under <i>Bhūta</i>) a being, natural, real, PED: that which is, <i>i.e.</i> natural, genuine, true; nt. truth; negative <i>abhūta</i> falsehood, lie; <i>Bya:</i> via, by way of.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Pisuṇā—vācā.</i> PED: backbiting, calumnious, malicious speech. PED: [cp. Sanskrit <i>pishāca</i> and Vedic <i>pishāci;</i> to same root as <i>pisuna</i> = Vedic <i>pishuna,</i> and Latin <i>piget,</i> Ohg. <i>fehida</i> enmity = Ags. <i>faehp</i> ("feud"), connected with root of Goth. <i>fijan</i> to hate; thus <i>pisāca</i> = fiend]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Mittehi bhedana.</i> The making into enemies of friends alienated from each other by the malicious gossip. PED points to <i>Mithu &gt; Miccha:</i> contrary, low, wrong and the compound <i>*-bheda</i> [evidently in meaning of <i>mitta-bheda</i> "break of friendship," although <i>mithu</i> means "adversary," thus perhaps "breaking, so as to cause opposition"] breaking of alliance, enmity D II.76; J IV.184 (here with v. l. <i>mitta-</i>); Kvu 314. *friendship; <i>bhedana:</i> breaking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Pharusā — vācā. &gt; Pharasu:</i> hatchet. Harsh, unkind, rough speech. Here on this site the interpretation is being bounded by the idea of 'hurtful' — intended to hurt — and its interpretation as 'distasteful to some ears' is being rejected. A great deal of the literal <i>Pāḷi</i> would be found distasteful to the so-called cultured member of the modern U.S. This is just false modesty.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>Amanāpasadda.</i> <i>a:</i> un/not; <i>Manāpa:</i> pleasing; <i>Sadda:</i> words, sounds.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Sampha-p-palāpo. Sampha:</i> PED: frivolity, foolishness; only in connection with expressions of talking; <i>Palāpa:</i> chaff of corn to "chaff as frivolous talk" prattling, prattle, nonsense; adj. talking idly, chaffing, idle, void.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>Anādeyya vācā Anādara [an + ādara]</i> Dis- respect disrespectful speech.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Surā-meraya-pānaṃ</i> PED: <i>Surā</i> (f.) [Vedic <i>surā</i>] spirituous (intoxicating) liquor ("drink"); <i>*-meraya (-pāna)</i> (drinking) rum and spirits. This is further defined as spirits that have been fermented or distilled. Alcohol is intended. The use of alcohol was not originally dis-allowed to the <i>bhikkhus</i> and was not originally one of the precepts for laymen, and in and of itself it is not considered bad <i>kamma.</i> Alcohol was dis-allowed after an insident where a <i>bhikkhu</i> who otherwise had great magic powers lost control of his body which then assumed a disrespectful position towards Gotama. The idea is to avoid loss of control of one's behavior such that one creates bad <i>kamma </i> Psychadelic drugs should not be considered as included in a blanket way under this heading. Individuals who use psychadelic drugs that find themselves losing control of their behavior should abstain from their use as they should abstain from doing anything else that caused them to lose control of their behavior and perform badly conceived deeds. Alcohol is the exception because 'there is no controlling the mind by a person intoxicated with alcohol.' [Gotama] Further, there is a long tradition of use of 'ambrosias' drinks that transport one to the gods. <i>i.e.,</i> psychadelics.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Ummattaka. Ummatta</i> (adj.) [<i>ud + matta</i> of mad] out of one's mind, mad</p>
