					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This sutta is almost identical to AN 8.65. I have adapted the title there to fit the meaning here. The <i>Pāḷi</i> retains the title <i>Abhibhāyatana Suttaṃ:</i> The Spheres of Mastery over Fear. <i>Abhibhāyatanāni.</i> PED gives: <i>abhibhū + āyatana. Āyatana</i> is 'sphere'; <i>Ābhibhū</i> is 'Overlord', referring to the idea of lordship (Childers: 'vanquisher'; CPD: sovereign, also: defeater, ruler) and also to the ruler of the sphere of non-perception. But also there is <i>Abhibhūta:</i> overcoming, or being overwhelmed, with specific reference to the involvements (hindrances, <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm"><i>nīvaraṇā</i></a>). Bhk. Bodhi accepts the commentarial explanation that these 'are approaches to the <i>kasiṇas</i>' and are describing the mastering or overcoming of the adverse qualities of such. To me this explains nothing and does not fit the word. How in this scheme are these 'spheres'? (OK, they are often round in the form which is known to Buddhaghosa, but what he calls a <i>kasiṇa</i> is a later 'abstract' version. For example, the earth <i>kasiṇa</i> which he has is a round 'sphere' of earth, but its original form was simply a plowed field; the 'wind' <i>kasiṇa</i> was just the perception of leaves blowing in the wind, etc.) I think the meaning needs to be found in the terms themselves. For that I think it is not unreasonable to see that this word can also be broken down into: <i>abhi + bhāya.</i> Over-fear. Or putting the two definitions together (which I believe is often what was intended in the original coining of words) 'Overcoming fear' or 'Mastering Fear', the Spheres of Mastery Over Fear (or over those things which cause fear, such as 'passion' and the <i>nīvaraṇā</i>). Here that is exactly the meaning given to this group of ideas: that is that they are to be understood for the overcoming of passion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Ajjhatta. adhi + atta</i> = over + self or encompassing that which is held by the self. Hare: personally, Bhks. Bodhi and Thanissaro: internally. The idea is that which is identified as the self; the generic form used is because different beings regard different things as the self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Bahiddhā.</i> <i>Bahi + dha</i> Outside + held. In opposition to <i>Ajjhatta.</i> External, impersonal, that which is 'held to be outside' Again the generic form is used because different individuals hold different ideas as to what belongs to the self and what belongs to the outside.</p>
