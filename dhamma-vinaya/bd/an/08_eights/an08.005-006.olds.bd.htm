					<p class="f4">Beggars! To the uneducated common man come gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Beggars, to the well educated student of the Aristocrats come gain and loss, honor and dishonor, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">So then, this being the case, what distinguishes the path of the well educated student of the Aristocrats from that of the uneducated common man?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us," said those Beggars, "the Lucky Man is the source of dhamma, our guide, our protector.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would clearly be for our good, Broke Tooth, if the Lucky Man were to explain the meaning of this; when the Beggars hear this from the Lucky Man they will retain it in mind."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Very well, then, Beggars!<br />
					Pay Attention!<br />
					Give Ear!<br />
					I will speak!</p>

					<p class="f4">And those Beggars responding:<br />
					"Broke Tooth!"<br />
					the Lucky Man said this:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, Beggars, gain comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This gain is impermanent,<br />
					inherently painful,<br />
					a thing subject to reversal."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Honor comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					a thing subject to reversal."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a thing they really do not understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasure comes to the uneducated common man unaccompanied by the reflection:</p>

I use the other, primarily, because it is more instructive to those beginning their studies of the Dhamma.<br />
					<b>Loka-dhammā:</b> worldly Dhammas; objectives, objects, things. At one point I was translating Dhamma only with the term "Object" which fits remarkably well in virtually every case except the one involving being understood by most people.</p>
