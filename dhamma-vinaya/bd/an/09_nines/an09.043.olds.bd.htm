					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Kāyasakkhi.</i> It is my understanding that what this term means is what Don Juan speaks of (when Carlos Casteneda translates his words) as 'the body knowing'. This is the phenomena we know of as bodily conditioning. The state of the body as having been conditioned to make certain responses to familiar situations without intervening thought. We shave virtually without thinking about the process. The body 'knows' the routine. After a period of training the stomach and digestive tract and the apparatus for evacuation of waste 'appreciate' the fact that we do not eat more than it is necessary to keep the body going. In the cases given in this sutta the phenomena is, of course, applied to a higher sphere of knowing, but the mechanism is the same. The body has a sense, in solitude, of the lessening of the stresses placed on it. But there is still that which remains ... until all external stresses are finally removed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>  <i>pīti-</i> A change from my usual 'enthusiasm'. <i>Pīti</i> is a concept which encompasses a spectrum of items (from a mild approval to an extatic rapture) which could all be classed under the heading 'appreciation.' Some may recall that this term was my original choice for <i>Pīti.</i> The first jhāna being described in brief by me as being "the appreciation of the peace and calm of solitude." The statement here "the appreciation of the pleasure of solitude", has the advantage of putting 'pleasure' at a distance — rather than having it be a bodily sensation it becomes a mental appreciation.</p>
