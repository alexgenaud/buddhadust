					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This sutta should be read together with AN 9.44, 45. It should be noted that there is, in this description, no difference between the body-knower and the wisdom-freed in terms of bodily experiencing the <i>jhānas.</i> This would make the wisdom-freed always both-ways freed. In other places the body-seer is spoken of as one who has also achieved the three visions of the Arahant (past abodes, the outcome of deeds and knowledge of the eradication of the <i>'āsavas'</i>) and the wisdom-freed is, at least in one place spoken of as being without the first two of these visions. In still other places all three visions are said to be properties of the Arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Kāya-sakkhi.</i> It is my understanding that what this term means is what Don Juan speaks of (when Carlos Casteneda translates his words) as 'the body knowing'. This is the phenomena we know of as bodily conditioning. The state of the body as having been conditioned to make certain responses to familiar situations without intervening thought. We shave virtually without thinking about the process. The body 'knows' the routine. After a period of training the stomach and digestive tract and the apparatus for evacuation of waste 'appreciate' the fact that we do not eat more than it is necessary to keep the body going. In the cases given in this sutta the phenomena is, of course, applied to a higher sphere of knowing, but the mechanism is the same. The body has a sense, in solitude, of the lessening of the stresses placed on it. But there is still that which remains ... until all external stresses are finally removed. Thus the state where sense-perception and sense-experience end and achieving that, has become detached, and detached sees that as freedom and freed, sees freedom as freedom and he knows that he is free of the <i>'āsavas', i.e.,</i> the state of the Arahant known as the body-knower.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Pīti-</i> A change from my usual 'enthusiasm'. <i>Pīti</i> is a concept which encompasses a spectrum of items (from a mild approval to an ecstatic rapture) which could all be classed under the heading 'appreciation.' Some may recall that this term was my original choice for <i>Pīti.</i> The first <i>jhāna</i> being described in brief by me as being "the appreciation of the peace and calm of solitude." The statement here "the appreciation of the pleasure of solitude", has the advantage of putting 'pleasure' at a distance — rather than having it be a bodily sensation it becomes a mental appreciation.</p>
