					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Kamma.</i> Deed or action and its consequence. Differing from <i>'saṇkhāra'</i> in that <i>'saṇkhāra'</i> is always performed with the intent to experience; <i>kamma</i> may be performed with the intent to end <i>kamma</i> [e.g. abstention from action when opportunity permits with the intent of fully experiencing, learning from and ending the sort of action which produced such a consequence] or with such an intent as produces no result [e.g. a strictly factual answer to a question]. See note 4 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Attha.</i> Hare: Hope; Sister Upalivanna: purpose; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: purpose.<br />
					PED: 1. interest, advantage, gain; (moral) good, blessing, welfare; profit, prosperity, well-being.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Brahmā-cariya.</i> Carrying one's self in the manner of Brahmā. Frequently, but not exclusively indicating a celibate life [too frequently explained as such in the footnotes of translations], its meaning covers a much broader scope of behaviors and can be used to describe the entire practice of the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>'yaṃ <b>kammaṃ</b> vedanīyaṃ taṃ me <b>kammaṃ</b> avedaniyaṃ hotū'</i> It is important to notice that what is being spoken of is the goal of an individual still identifying with sense experience. The issue here being discussed is: 'Is the goal the idea of changing <i>kamma</i> for a person still subject to <i>kamma?</i>' So the idea in this section is 'let me not experience the result of such and such a specific deed' — while not intending the escape from <i>kamma</i> altogether.<br />
					Hare leaves the question of <i>'kamma'</i> out of his translation completely and so switches the focus from the <i>kamma</i> to the experience. Since it is in fact the goal of the system to change what is experienced into what is not experienced, the meaning comes out incorrectly. Sister Upalivanna and <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro set up the aspiration properly: may such and such a <i>kamma</i> become such and such another <i>kamma.</i></p>
