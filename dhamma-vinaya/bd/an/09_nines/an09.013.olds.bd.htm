					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Kamma.</i> Deed or action and its consequence. Differing from <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> in that <i>'saŋkhāra'</i> is always performed with the intent to experience; <i>kamma</i> may be performed with the intent to end <i>kamma</i> [e.g. abstention from action when opportunity permits with the intent of fully experiencing, learning from and ending the sort of action which produced such a consequence] or with such an intent as produces no result [e.g. a strictly factual answer to a question]. See note 4 below.</p>

Frequently, but not exclusively indicating a celebate life [too frequently explained as such in the footnotes of translations], it's meaning covers a much broader scope of behaviors and can be used to describe the entire practice of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>'yaɱ <b>kammaɱ</b> vedanīyaɱ taɱ me <b>kammaɱ</b> avedaniyaɱ hotū'</i> It is important to notice that what is being spoken of is the goal of an individual still identifying with sense experience. The issue here being discussed is: 'Is the goal the idea of changing <i>kamma</i> for a person still subject to kamma?' So the idea in this section is 'let me not experience the result of <i>such and such</i> a specific deed' — while not intending the escape from <i>kamma</i> altogether.<br />
					Hare leaves the question of <i>'kamma'</i> out of his translation completely and so switches the focus from the <i>kamma</i> to the experience. Since it is in fact the goal of the system to change what is experienced into what is not experienced, the meaning comes out incorrectly. Sister Upalivana and Bhk. Thanissaro set up the aspiration properly: may such and such a <i>kamma</i> become such and such another kamma.</p>
