					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, <i>Bhagava,</i> Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />

					<p class="f4">There then, the Venerable Sāriputta, having arisen earlier,<br />

					<p class="f4">But then the Venerable Sāriputta said to himself:</p>

Support, fuel, grasping, bind-ups, issues, scaffolding, ensnarements ... This term is the one used for the 'rebound' subsequent to being down-bound to (ensnarled by, knotted to, going down to) <i>taṇhā</i> 'thirst', hunger, desire, wanting and prior to 'becoming' or 'being' or 'living' or 'existing'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Between wanting and becoming is intention to get, planning, and taking some action to get and this is based on some idea of what it is one wants to get and experience. Think of 'setting the ball rolling'. Fueling, but not 'fuel'. Stoking the fire. Most frequently translated 'grasping' in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> and with regard to the <i>khandhas;</i> in the present context usually 'substrata'. I have used 'bound up', and 'upkeep' previously.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">As best as I understand the matter, what it is that remains after death that is the subject here is fond recollections (recollections connected with longing, not simply memories), thoughts (again, those connected with unresolved anger and longing), intentions, impulses to act, unresolved commitments, promises, debts, <i>kamma</i> which is to be experienced or resolved but which has not yet been dealt with: and so forth here using the ten <i>Saṇyojānanaṃ.</i> (see next note), yokes to rebirth, in other cases various aspects of hanging on to <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/salayatana.htm">the six sense realms</a> or the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panc_upadana_kkhandha.htm">khandhas.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Antarā-parinibbāyī.</i> As defined in the footnotes of the PTS translations, in PED and in Cohen's NPD, this is a technical term which means a non-returner who, after death and after rebirth in some unspecified heaven reaches thorough coolness before the end or around the mid-point of that life. I have checked <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.33.05.pali.bd.htm#p5.18">DN 3. XXXIII,</a> PTS trans, pg 227: 'one who passes away before middle age in that world in which he has been reborn' (but the <i>Pāḷi</i> does not contain anything like 'in that world in which he has been reborn'. [Follow above link to see for yourself.] I have also checked out the other references given in footnotes and the dictionaries and in every case what is happening is that a definition/translation is being given to this term that is not to be found in the <i>Suttas</i> (that is, it is likely being taken from commentary). By itself, which is what I believe the proper method in this case would indicate, the translation is: midway-allround-cool(er) or between) or if you want to go to 'Old <i>Pāḷi</i>': End-around-all-around-cooler or fore-around-all-around-cooler. In the list of non-returners in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p16">AN 7.16</a> which is the same as in this sutta and in DN 33, this person is the first in the descending-in-accomplishment group found here and each term of which is similarly translated with reference to information outside the suttas. The possibilities are that this is in fact reference to reaching the cool mid-term of the next life, or, looking at the last term, which speaks of rebirth in the <i>Akaniṭṭha</i> Realm, a Pure Abode, which is a destination exclusively for Non-returners where all persons born there attain the cool mid-way through the given lifespan there and thinking 'hum ... this looks like the last person is experiencing the same destiny as the first,' concluding that what may be being spoken of is 'midway between the death in this body and the next rebirth.' This is, of course, a point which raises a hullabaloo in some circles. I don't see any problem with the idea that there is a period of time which varies for different individuals between say 'formal rebirths' and simply traveling around disembodied such as in a dream and that what is being spoken of in this series is the length of that period — the endpoint of which period for the non-returner if he had not got free earlier would be rebirth in the <i>Akaniṭṭha</i> realm. I am translating the terms as found, leaving the meaning ambiguous. I do not recall a case where a technical term not obvious from the formation of the term itself is not defined within the <i>Suttas.</i> Remember! The list is in descending order of skill, so each subsequent term is describing a person with more holding on than the one before.</p>
