<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Nines, Sutta 45. Ānanda explains the extent of what the Buddha meant by the idea of being 'by two-measures freed.' Such a one is both a seer-in-body and wisdom-freed. A seer-in-body is described as one who advances through the stages to arahantship in each case living in contact with the body. One who is wisdom-freed has advanced through the stages to arahantship seeing the wisdom of each stage." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Ancient Ānanda, Kosambī revisiting, Ghosita park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the venerable Udāyin visited the Ancient Ānanda, and, after exchanging greetings,
					sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seated at one side, then, the venerable Udāyin said this to the Ancient Ānanda:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Two measure-freed, two measure-freed'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> it is said, friend,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend, in a bhikkhu<br />
					separating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
					separating himself from unskillful things,<br />
					with thought and with consideration,<br />
					with the appreciation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of the pleasure of solitude,<br />

					resolving thought and consideration,<br />
					internally pacified,<br />
					whole-heartedly single-minded,<br />

					spoken of by the Aristocrat as:</p>
