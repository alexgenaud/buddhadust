<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya, Nines, Sutta 45. Ānanda explains the extent of what the Buddha meant by the idea of being 'by two-measures freed.' Such a one is both a seer-in-body and wisdom-freed. A seer-in-body is described as one who advances through the stages to arahantship in each case living in contact with the body. One who is wisdom-freed has advanced through the stages to arahantship seeing the wisdom of each stage." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Ancient Ānanda, Kosambī revisiting, Ghosita park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the venerable Udāyin visited the Ancient Ānanda, and, after exchanging greetings,
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side, then, the venerable Udāyin said this to the Ancient Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Two measure-freed, two measure-freed'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> it is said, friend,<br />
					to what extent then, friend, does the Lucky Man speak of being 'two measure-freed'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend, in a <i>bhikkhu,</i><br />
					separating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
					separating himself from unskillful things,<br />
					with thought and with consideration,<br />
					with the appreciation<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of the pleasure of solitude,<br />
					there arises and abides the first knowledge.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					suchis suchas he habitually contacts with body<br />
					and this is understood wisely.</p>

					<p class="f4">To just this extent,<br />
					being by two-measures-freed is spoken of by the Lucky Man as<br />
					'encompassed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, deeper than that, friend, in a <i>bhikkhu</i><br />
					resolving thought and consideration,<br />
					internally pacified,<br />
					whole-heartedly single-minded,<br />
					without thought,<br />
					without consideration,<br />
					with the appreciation of the pleasure of knowledge,<br />
					there arises and abides the second knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, deeper than that, friend, in a <i>bhikkhu</i><br />
					living detached and indifferent to enthusiasms<br />
					recollected and self-aware,<br />
					experiencing that bodily ease<br />
					spoken of by the Aristocrat as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Detached, recollected, taking it easy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">there arises and abides the third knowledge.</p>

					letting go of pain,<br />
					antecedent mental ease and mental pain settling down,<br />
					without pain but without pleasure,<br />
					detached,<br />
					recollected,<br />
					all-around perfectly pure,<br />
					there arises and abides the fourth knowledge.</p>
