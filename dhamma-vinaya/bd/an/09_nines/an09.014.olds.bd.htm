					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, <i>Bhagava,</i> Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Ancient Samiddhi approached the Ancient Sāriputto and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with the Ancient Sāriputto.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, seated together there, the Ancient Sāriputto said this to the Ancient Samiddhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What basis is there, Samiddhi,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But then, Samiddhi,<br />
					to what are they joined?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are joined to sensation, <i>bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"But then, Samiddhi,<br />
					what is at the interface?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Serenity is at the interface, <i>bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"But then, Samiddhi,<br />
					what rules them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Memory rules them, <i>bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"But then, Samiddhi,<br />
					what is their uttermost?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wisdom is their uttermost, <i>bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"But then, Samiddhi,<br />
