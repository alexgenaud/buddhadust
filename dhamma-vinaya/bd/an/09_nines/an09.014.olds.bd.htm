					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with The Ancient Sāriputto.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, seated together there, The Ancient Sāriputto said this to The Ancient Samiddhi:</p>
