					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man,<br />
					revisiting Malla-land,<br />
					the market-town named Sandy-bank-propper.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man, having arisen previously,<br />
					taking bowl and robes,<br />
					entered Uruvelakappa on his begging round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having gone his rounds in Sandy-bank-propper,<br />
					having eaten and returned,<br />
					he addressed elder Ānanda saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stay right here, Ānanda,<br />
					while I abide plunging into Great Woods<br />
					for the afternoon sitting."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante,"</i> responded Ānanda to the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky man plunged into Great Woods,<br />
					to abide the day sitting at the root of a certain tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Tapusso the housefather approached elder Ānanda and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near elder Ānanda and exchanged greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					Tapusso the householder addressed elder Ānanda<br />
					saying this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We householders, venerable Ānanda,<br />
					amass sensual pleasures,<br />
					find joy in sensual pleasures,<br />
					are intent on sensual pleasures,<br />
					delight in sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">To us householders, venerable,<br />
					amassing sensual pleasures,<br />
					finding joy in sensual pleasures,<br />
					intent on sensual pleasures,<br />
					delighting in sensual pleasures,<br />
					this appears like a cliff,<br />
					that is to say: abandoning.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard this, <i>Bhante:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">'In this <i>Dhamma-Vinaya,</i> young,<br />
					very young <i>bhikkhus</i> hearts leap up,<br />
					brighten up,<br />
					stand independent,<br />
					freed,<br />
					seeing:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is tranquility"'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely here, <i>Bhante,</i> with this <i>Dhamma-Vinaya,</i><br />
					<i>bhikkhus</i> are differentiated<br />
					from the great mass of people<br />
					that is to say in the matter of abandoning."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt439" href="../../../pali/an/09_nines/an09.041.pali.bd.htm#pg439"><span class="f2">[439]</span></a> "Now this, householder, is a talk<br />
					we should see the Lucky Man about.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us draw near<br />
					and approaching The Lucky Man<br />
					relate this matter to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However the Lucky Man explains it,<br />
					that is how we should bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so <i>Bhante!"</i> said Tapusso the householder to Ananda in response.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the elder Ānanda<br />
					together with Tapussa the householder<br />
					drew near The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near and giving salutation,<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					Ānanda said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, <i>Bhante,</i> Tapusso the Householder said this to me:</p>

							<p class="in2">'We householders, venerable Ānanda,<br />
							amass sensual pleasures,<br />
							find joy in sensual pleasures,<br />
							are intent on sensual pleasures,<br />
							delight in sensual pleasures.</p>

							<p class="in2">To us householders, venerable,<br />
							amassing sensual pleasures,<br />
							finding joy in sensual pleasures,<br />
							intent on sensual pleasures,<br />
							delighting in sensual pleasures,<br />
							this appears like a cliff,<br />
							that is to say: abandoning.</p>

							<p class="in2">I have heard this, <i>Bhante:</i></p>

							<p class="in2">"In this <i>Dhamma-Vinaya,</i> young,<br />
							very young <i>bhikkhus</i> hearts leap up,<br />
							brighten up,<br />
							stand independent,<br />
							freed,<br />

							<p class="in2">'This is tranquility'".</p>

							<p class="in2">Surely here, <i>Bhante,</i> with this <i>Dhamma-Vinaya,</i><br />
							bhikkhus are differentiated<br />
							from the great mass of people<br />
							that is to say in the matter of abandoning.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even I, Ānanda,<br />
					before my self-awakening,<br />
					self-awakening not yet acchieved,<br />
					still just an awakening being,<br />
					thought to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is a good thing, this abandoning.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet my heart, Ānanda, at this abandoning,<br />
					did not leap up,<br />
					did not become clear,<br />
					did not find self-assurance,<br />
					did not find freedom,<br />
					seeing 'This is tranquillity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, I thought to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the driving force,<br />
					what is it that results in my heart<br />
					not leaping up,<br />
					not becoming clear,<br />
					not finding self-assurance,<br />
					not finding freedom<br />
					seeing "This is tranquillity"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, I thought to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have not seen the disadvantage of sensuality,<br />
					and thus have not made a big thing of that,<br />
					the advantage of abandoning has not been achieved<br />
					and thus has not been appreciated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why my heart,<br />
					does not leap up,<br />
					does not become clear,<br />
					does not find self-assurance,<br />
					does not find freedom,<br />
					in this abandoning,<br />
					seeing "This is tranquillity."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, I thought to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose then I examine the disadvantages of sensuality<br />
					make a big thing of that,<br />
					achieving the advantage of abandoning,<br />
					I would to appreciate it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that way my heart,<br />
					should leap up,<br />
					should become clear,<br />
					should find self-assurance,<br />
					should find freedom,<br />
					in this abandoning,<br />
					seeing "This is tranquillity."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, after a time,<br />
					isolating myself from sense pleasures,<br />
					isolating myself from unskillful things,<br />
					with thinking,<br />
					with pondering isolation-born pleasureable-enthusiasm<br />
					I entered into<br />
					and abode in<br />
					the first burning knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, after a time,<br />
					examining the disadvantages of sensuality,<br />
					making a big thing of that,<br />
					achieving the advantage of abandoning,<br />

					my heart leaped up,<br />
					became clear,<br />
					found self-assurance,<br />
					found freedom,<br />
					in this abandoning,<br />
					seeing 'This is tranquillity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, after a time,<br />
					isolated from sensuality,<br />
					isolating myself from unskillful things,<br />
					with re-thinking,<br />
					with re-examination,<br />
					appreciation of the peace born of solitude,<br />
					gave rise to inhabiting the first gnosis.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, as I inhabited this habitat,<br />
					perceptions and mental studies<br />
					accompanying sensuality arose in me,<br />
					and this was for me, affliction.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Ānanda, as for some happy person<br />
					should some pain arise<br />
					it would be an affliction,<br />
					even so, for me as I inhabited this habitat,<br />
					perceptions and mental studies<br />
					accompanying sensuality arose in me,<br />
					and this was for me, affliction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, I thought to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is a good thing, this being distant from sensuality,<br />
					being distant from unskillful things,<br />
					yet my heart, at this being distant from sensuality,<br />
					this being distant from unskillful things,<br />

					did not find freedom,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, I thought to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, after a time,<br />

					internally self-possessed<br />
