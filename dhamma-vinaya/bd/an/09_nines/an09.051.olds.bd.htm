					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Ancient Ānanda,<br />
					Kosambī revisiting,<br />
					Ghosita park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the venerable Udāyin visited The Ancient Ānanda<br />
					and, after exchanging greetings and salutations,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					he said this to The Ancient Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'<i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing!<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing!',<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> friend, so it is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent then, friend,<br />
					has the Lucky Man spoken of<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friend, a bhikkhu<br />
					isolating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
					isolating himself from unskillful things,<br />
					with thinking,<br />
					with pondering<br />
					isolation-born pleasurable-enthusiasm<br />
					rises up into and makes a habitat of<br />
					The First Burning Knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever is whatever of that sphere<br />
					that is such as that<br />
					which he lives<br />
					touching with body<br />
					and understanding with wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">To just this extent then friend,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, friend, deeper than that,<br />
					a beggar,<br />
					dissolving thought and pondering,<br />

					letting go of pleasures,<br />
					letting go of pains,<br />
					settling down the antecedent mental ease and mental pain,<br />
					without pain, but without pleasure,<br />

					Hare: "in one particular";<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: "in a provisional sense".
					I would say: "To the extent that what is experienced is seen as a result of letting go and not doing rather than as a thing that has been got, there is the experience of a taste of <i>Nibbāna</i> in this seen thing."</p>
