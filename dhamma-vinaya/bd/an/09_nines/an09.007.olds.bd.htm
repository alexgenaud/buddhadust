					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Bhagava, Rājagaha revisiting, Vulture's-head rock.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Sutava the Wanderer approached Bhagava and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Sutava the Wanderer said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There was once, Bhante, a time when the Lucky Man, this very Rājagaha revisiting, Vulture Head.<br />
					There, Bhante, I heard this from the mouth,<br />
					received this from the mouth of The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The beggar, Sutava, who is arahant,<br />
					corruptions eliminated,<br />
					un-ocupied,<br />
					duty's doing done,<br />
					load laid down,<br />
					his own good gained,<br />
					yokes to living thoroughly broken,<br />
					highest answer-knowledge free,<br />
					cannot behave in these five manners of carring on:</p>

					<p class="f4">A corruptions-eliminated beggar cannot behave with the purpose of cutting off breathing life.</p>

					<p class="f4">A corruptions-eliminated beggar cannot behave such as to take by theft what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">A corruptions-eliminated beggar cannot behave such as to knowingly tell a lie.</p>

					<p class="f4">A corruptions-eliminated beggar cannot behave such as to store up for the pleasure of enjoyment in the same way as when earlier living in a house.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope, bhante,<br />
					I well-heard,<br />
					well-grasped,<br />
					well-meditated on,<br />

					<p class="f4">3. That you have, Sutava! That you have!</p>
