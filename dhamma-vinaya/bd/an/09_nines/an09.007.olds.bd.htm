					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, <i>Bhagava,</i> Rājagaha revisiting, Vulture's-head rock.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Sutava the Wanderer approached <i>Bhagava</i> and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Sutava the Wanderer said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There was once, <i>Bhante,</i> a time when the Lucky Man, this very Rājagaha revisiting, Vulture Head.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, <i>Bhante,</i> I heard this from the mouth,<br />
					received this from the mouth of The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The beggar, Sutava, who is arahant,<br />

					<p class="f4">A corruptions-eliminated beggar cannot behave such as to store up for the pleasure of enjoyment in the same way as when earlier living in a house.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope, bhante,<br />
