					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Tathāgata.</i> The That-that-got-that. An arahant, one who has got the goal, but also used by the Buddha to refer to himself, and when this term is used by others to describe the Buddha, it is done as is seen here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Thūpa.</i> PED: A stupa or tope, a bell-shaped pile of earth, a mound, tumulus, cairn; dome, especially a monument erected over the ashes of an <i>Arahant</i> (otherwise called <i>dhātugabbha = dāgaba</i>), or on spots consecrated as scenes of his acts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup><i>Buddha.</i> This must mean "awakened by the self," as we know that the followers of a Buddha are also awakened. Or, it is possible that an early use of this term was restricted to persons who became awakened without the aid of another. A "Solitary-Buddha" <i>(Pacceka-Buddha)</i> is one who becomes awakened without the aid of another, but who does not have the power or inclination or charisma to teach a multitude.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> This according to Childers. Woodward footnotes that they were under the rule of Kubera (Vessavaṇa), the lord of treasure and gnomes. AKA Vesavana, the Great King of the North. However he appears to be expressing doubt <i>(cuisquis?)</i> ("whoever, whatever"). The name means literally "What-people". (For a little more on Vesavana, see the beginning of DN 32: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.32.rhyt.pts.htm">The Ward Rune of Āṭānāṭa</a>) Bhikkhu Bodhi translates "fauns".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Here both Woodward and Bhikkhu Bodhi seem to be taking this backward, putting the tendency to corrupt on the Kimpurisā. But I have heard that the only beings that lie are humans, and further those that do lie would have no scruples about lying to mankind. On the other hand hearing non-humans (say fauns) speak could well disrupt the thinking of men.<br />
					Further, and on a different level, I do not really understand the use of <i>bhaṇimhā</i> here, and so have given it my own understanding of the situation.</p>
