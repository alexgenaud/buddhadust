					<p class="f4">In the same way, the good Gotama has<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Saṇkhittena.</i> Literally 'with a toss'; to toss off, toss in, throw out, throw in. Not exactly the style of the <i>Tathāgatas</i> this must have been understood more closely to what we have in English. Brief or concise ... or maybe not! ... 'to toss off witty repartee' does not imply the use of careless wording.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Vitthārena.</i> Actually more like 'at breadth' which we do not have. In depth will not do because all the Buddha's teachings, brief or lengthy are 'Wondrously Deep'. See: <a href="../03_threes/an03.123.olds.bd.htm">AN 3 123.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> What is under discussion here is not an offence which would be brought before the <i>Saṇgha</i> or a wrongful accusation which might be refuted by a "lion's roar" — that is by explaining how such a deed was not an offence and that an offence of such a nature as the accusation was not to be found in such a one. Here the offending behavior may not even have been seen by the accused, but is not denied just because of that. The transgression by both parties here is the making of a mountain of a mole hill, the making of a big fuss about a triviality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The point here is that in both cases the beggar has paid once for the goods (in the case of the accuser, by the disturbance he initially felt, and then by the disturbance he created by speaking of it to the accused; and in the case of the accused by the initial deed and then by the disturbance he created by speaking of it to others), and then by smuggling them across the border has incurred an additional fee in risk and guilt. Or, if he is caught, he looses his goods and must pay the penalty for smuggling as well. I am not sure which is intended.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> See: <a href="an02.031-040.olds.bd.htm#p40">AN 2 40</a> which compliments this sutta.</p>
