					<p><b>Translator's Introduction:</b></p>

					<p>Previously I have translated this sutta hearing <i>"nayidha paññāyetha mātā ti vā mātucchā ti vā mātulānī ... "</i> as does Woodward, as "then there would be <i>seen</i> no mother or mother's sister ..." [emphasis, mine]. And, since in the case of what is seen, it would not be that 'mothers' would not be seen, but that fathers would not be seen [known for certain], I reversed the genders. In this translation I have looked more closely and see that what is intended is the notion of women who are [to be or] not to be considered as elegible for casual sexual indulgence. So I believe what I have here is closer to the <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The paragraph describing the consequences to the world of being without the protections of sense of shame and fear of blame has also taken a turn here that is, I believe, more closely aligned with the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Woodward and Ireland, in a most reasonable way, take <i>"aje'akā kukkuṭa-sūkarā sona-sigālā"</i> as a list of promiscuous animals; Bhk. Thanissaro, in what looks like an attempt to come more closely into line with the <i>Pāḷi,</i> indicates pairs just slightly, in my opinion, missing the humor.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <i>Pāḷi</i> gives us three compounds: sheep-rams, pig-roosters, jackal-dogs. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> inserts hyphens. Bhk. Thanissaro reads that as pairings, linking the pairs with the word "with": "roosters with pigs," etc. I am taking them at their face value: pig-roosters, etc. pointing not to the state of promiscuity, but to the consequences.</p>

					<p class="f4">What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense of shame and fear of blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, beggars, these two good things<br />
					did not protect the world,<br />
					there would be no notion here<br />
					of 'this is a mother',<br />
					'this is a maternal aunt',<br />
					'this is a maternal uncle's wife',<br />
					'this is a teacher's wife',<br />
					'these are the women of a powerful man'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The world would become confusion<br />
					giving us such as sheep-rams,<br />
					pig-roosters,<br />
					jackal-dogs.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since, beggars, there are these two good things<br />
					protecting the world<br />
					there is the notion here<br />
					of 'this is a mother',<br />
					'this is a maternal aunt',<br />
					'this is a maternal uncle's wife',<br />
					'this is a teacher's wife',<br />
					'these are the women of a powerful man'.</p>
