					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Ajjhatta</i> and <i>bahiddhā.</i> Internal and external, which I have opted here to "the worldly" and "ending the worldly" for clarity of meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Woodward marks this as sutta #6; Bhikkhu Thanissaro, text and context include it in #5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Samacittā.</i> Litterally: Even-hearted (or °minded). Bhikkhu Thanissaro: Like-minded. Bhikkhu Bodhi: Same-minded. Woodward: of tranquil mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Anukampaṃ upādāyā.</i> Usually (Wooodward, Bhikkhu Bodhi): "out of compassion;" Bhikkhu Thanissaro:  "out of sympathy." But the context (why did those deities request that the Buddha visit Sariputta?) does not indicate that Sāriputa is in need of either compassion or sympathy, but because of the joy of his followers, is possibly in need of steadying support. <i>kampa</i> = unsteady.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Woodward remarks in a footnote: "Our text is not very clearly punctuated here." I have put it as I hear it, not as it is presented in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I have altered the linked Pāḷi to match my translation, but here is the way it appears in the PTS text:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>"Tasmāt iha Sāriputta evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ: santindriyā bhavissāma santamānasā' ti. Evaṃ hi vo Sāriputta sikkhitabbaṃ. Santindriyānaṃ hi vo Sāriputta santamānasānaṃ santaṃ yeva kāya-kammaṃ bhavissati santaṃ vacī-kammaṃ santaṃ mano-kammaṃ santaṃ yeva upahāraṃ upaharissāma sabrahma-cārīsū' ti. Evaṃ hi vo Sāriputta sikkhitabbaṃ."|| ||</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Woodward: "Indeed, Sāriputta, those who are thus tranquil in sense, tranquil in mind, their bodily action also will be tranquil. And the same for speech and thought; thus must you train yourself: 'We will present to our fellows in the righteous life  tranquillity of speech and tranquillity of thought, — a present of tranquillity.'"<br />
					Bhikkhu Thanissaro: "When you are peaceful in your faculties and peaceful in your hearts, peaceful will be your bodily actions, peaceful your verbal actions, peaceful your mental actions. [Thinking,] 'We will render only peaceful service to our fellows in the holy life': That's how you should train yourselves."<br />
					Bhikkhu Bodhi (exerpt only, the full sutta is not among those free of copyright restrictions): "When you have peaceful sense faculties and peaceful minds your bodily action will be peaceful ... verbal ... mental ... [Thinking:] 'We will offer only peaceful service to our fellow monks' it is in such a way, Sāriputta that you should train yourselves."</p>
