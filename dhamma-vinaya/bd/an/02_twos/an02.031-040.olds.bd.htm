					<p class="f4">And this, beggars: Even establishing sovereignty of Mother and Father<br />

					<p class="f4">Mother and Father do much for their child: — protecting, nourishing,<br />
					they raise him to sight of this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, beggars, whoever, with regard to his Mother and Father,<br />
					rouses, establishes, settles the faithless in faith,<br />
					rouses, establishes, settles the unethical in the ethical,<br />
					rouses, establishes, settles the stingy in generosity,<br />
					rouses, establishes, settles the stupid in wisdom,<br />
					with even just this then, beggars,<br />
					would one have made repayment and payment to Mother and Father.</p>
