					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthaiṇḍika's Sporting Grounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man said this to the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"<br />
					and the beggars responding<br />
					"Venerable"<br />
					The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are two types of faults, beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">The 'in this seen thing' fault, and<br />
					the 'belonging to the future' fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is the<br />

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, one sees a robber, a criminal,<br />

					<p class="f4">lashed with a whip, or<br />

					lashed with a split stick,<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup> or</p>

					<p class="f4">having his hand cut off, or<br />
					having his foot cut off, or<br />
					having his hands and feet cut off, or<br />
					having his ear cut off, or<br />
					having his nose cut off, or<br />
					having his ears and nose cut off, or</p>

					<p class="f4">being given the 'porridge-pot,'<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> or<br />
					being given the 'conch-shaved-mountain',<sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup> or<br />

					being given the 'fire-garland,' or<br />

					<p class="f4">being sprayed with boiling oil, or<br />
					being fed to the dogs, or<br />
					being impaled on a sharp stake, or<br />

					<p class="f4">At that he has this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So that then<br />

					<p class="f4">It is from that type of thing<br />
					that one sees a robber,<br />
					a criminal,<br />
					seized by the king<br />
					for the making of various done deeds</p>

					<p class="f4">lashed with a whip, or<br />
					lashed with a cane, or<br />
					lashed with a split stick, or</p>

					<p class="f4">having his hand cut off, or<br />
					having his foot cut off, or<br />
					having his hands and feet cut off, or<br />
					having his ear cut off, or<br />
					having his nose cut off, or<br />
					having his ears and nose cut off, or</p>

					<p class="f4">being given the "porridge-pot," or<br />
					being given the "conch-shaved-mountain," or<br />
					being given the "sunny-face," or<br />
					being given the "fire-garland," or<br />
					being given the "inflamed-hand," or<br />
					being given the "grass-revolving," or<br />

					<p class="f4">So then, if I did likewise,
					like a robber,<br />
					a criminal,<br />
					seized by the king<br />
					for the making of various done deeds<br />
					I too would</p>

					<p class="f4">be lashed with a whip, or<br />

					<p class="f4">He, terrified of an<br />

					is not brought to acts<br />

					<p class="f4">This, beggars<br />
					is what is said to be<br />
					the 'in this seen thing' fault.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is the<br />
					the 'belonging to the future' fault?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars,<br />
					one describes<br />
					that which belongs to the future<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bodily pain-causing behavior<br />
					has a bad fruition<br />
					for the self<br />
					in the future beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vocal pain-causing behavior<br />
					has a bad fruition<br />
					for the self<br />
					in the future beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mental pain-causing behavior<br />
					has a bad fruition<br />
					for the self<br />
					in the future beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, if I were to engage in<br />
					bodily pain-causing behavior<br />
					vocal pain-causing behavior<br />
					mental pain-causing behavior<br />
					at the brake-up of the body at death<br />
					I would arise in<br />
					the lower depths<br />
					the painful downfall<br />
					Niraya Hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, terrified of a<br />
					'belonging to the future' fault,<br />
					lets go bodily pain-causing behavior, and<br />
					develops bodily pleasure-causing behavior,<br />
					lets go verbal pain-causing behavior, and<br />
					develops verbal pleasure-causing behavior,<br />
					lets go mental pain-causing behavior, and<br />
					develops mental pleasure-causing behavior,<br />
					thus protecting his unprotected purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars,<br />
					is what is said to be<br />
					the 'belonging to the future' fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, beggars, are the two faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, beggars,<br />
					thus should you train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will be terrified of<br />
					"in this seen thing" faults<br />
					"belonging to the future" faults.</p>

					<p><b>Translator's Introduction:</b></p>

					<p>Previously I have translated this sutta hearing <i>"nayidha paññāyetha mātā ti vā mātucchā ti vā mātulānī ... "</i> as does Woodward, as "then there would be <i>seen</i> no mother or mother's sister ..." [emphasis, mine]. And, since in the case of what is seen, it would not be that 'mothers' would not be seen, but that fathers would not be seen [known for certain], I reversed the genders. In this translation I have looked more closely and see that what is intended is the notion of women who are [to be or] not to be considered as elegible for casual sexual indulgence. So I believe what I have here is closer to the <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The paragraph describing the consequences to the world of being without the protections of sense of shame and fear of blame has also taken a turn here that is, I believe, more closely aligned with the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Woodward and Ireland, in a most reasonable way, take <i>"aje'akā kukkuṭa-sūkarā sona-sigālā"</i> as a list of promiscuous animals; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro, in what looks like an attempt to come more closely into line with the <i>Pāḷi,</i> indicates pairs just slightly, in my opinion, missing the humor.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <i>Pāḷi</i> gives us three compounds: sheep-rams, pig-roosters, jackal-dogs. The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> inserts hyphens. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro reads that as pairings, linking the pairs with the word "with": "roosters with pigs," etc. I am taking them at their face value: pig-roosters, etc. pointing not to the state of promiscuity, but to the consequences.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Similar to the musical instrument called a split-stick clapper. About four cubits in length, split into four sections to about three cubits. Extremely painful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> For brief descriptions of all these tortures see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/02_twos/an02.001-010.wood.pts.htm#n3">footnotes 3-17</a> in the Woodward translation.<br />
					For similar descriptions of these tortures, see:<br />
					<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-98.htm#n1">footnote 1 in the 98th section</a> of Buddhism in translations, by H.C. Warren. Quoting the commentary of this sutta,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p129">MN 129,</a><br />
					The Pali Line, <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/bag/advantages_disadvantages/03_prologue1.htm">Advantages and Disadvantages, Prologue 1</a><br />
					<i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi in footnote 216 of his translation of this sutta, quoting MA, gives more detail but only of five of the set:<br />
					(1) The porridge pot <i>(bilaṅga-thālikam):</i> they crack open his skull, take up a hot iron ball with tongs, put the ball inside, and boil his brains until they overflow.<br />
					(2) The polished-shell shave <i>(saṅkha-muṇḍikam):</i> they cut the skin [in the area] bounded by his upper lip, the roots of the ears, and gullet, bind all his head hairs into a knot, tie them around a stick, and pull it up, so that his skin together with his head hairs comes off; then they rub his skull with coarse sand and wash it, until it becomes the color of a conch shell.<br />
					(3) Rahu's mouth <i>(rāhu-mukham):</i> they force open his mouth with a spike and burn a lamp inside his mouth, or they dig into his mouth with a spade until the blood flows and fills his mouth.<br />
					(4) The fiery wreath <i>(joti-mālikam):</i> they wind an oiled cloth around his entire body and ignite it.<br />
					(5) The flaming hand (hattha-pa-j-jotika): they wind an oiled cloth around his hand and ignite it so that it burns like a lamp.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Text is <i>"saṅkha-muṇḍikam",</i> PED: bare (mountain), uncertain Text reading; Woodward has <i>"saṅkha-mukhaṇ",</i> shaving, tonsure. My guess is that all of these were more or less slang terms and this one would come from the similarity in appearance of the skull (after the torture) to a bald mountain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Eraka-vattikam. Vattika</i> is defined by PED as having the habit of horses, elephants etc. <i>Vattita</i> as that which goes on, round (of existence), revolution so it would appear to me closer to the meaning of the torture as described.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>khārāpatacchikam [ph. kharāpaticcakaṃ; Bh. khārāpatam]</i> Who knows? Just a guess.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> A little anacronistic but I think close to the  meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> For more detail on this see: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/02_twos/an02.001-010.wood.pts.htm#n29">AN 2.10, Woodward, note 29.</a></p>
