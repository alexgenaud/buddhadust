					<p class="ctr">Longnail, the Naked Ascetic</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The etiquette is interesting. In the Buddha's system one honors the Dhamma or one who is or will be teaching or explaining the Dhamma. This honor is demonstrated by the listener by (among other things such as not showing the soles of one's feet, wearing a hat or head covering, wearing sandals, asking to be taught in a rude way, etc.) taking a position that does not 'confront' (that is, to one side) and is lower than the honored teacher.<br />
					Approaching some honored person to listen or question, one walks along if the honored person is walking, stands still if the person is standing, sits if the person is sitting, reclines if the person is reclining [see: <a href="../../pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm#p11">DN 3 &sect; 11</a>]. Here Longnail chooses to stand.<br />
					Horner footnotes: "MA. iii. 203 says that he stood at a respectful distance because the Elder (Sāriputta) was standing fanning the Lord..." Longnail is, according to Horner quoting MA, Sariputta's nephew, so he may be giving respect to Sariputta.<br />
					My interpretation is that this does not then give disrespect to the Buddha [whom we assume is sitting although we have not been told this] because Sariputta is giving respect (serving) the Buddha. Paying respect to one paying respect, one pays respect to the one the one one is respecting is respecting, regardless of that one's position relative to the most honored one. Follow?<br />
					Although this does not look quite right to my eye (Sāriputta is not at this time an elder in the Saŋgha and is 'only' a streamwinner), I suspect it is in fact the correct behavior according to some scheme or another as the compilers would unlikely have let pass without comment an act of disrespect to the Buddha.<br />
					On the other hand, The Buddha may actually be standing as well. However, I vaguely recollect that the naked ascetics did not give respect to anyone and always stood in such situations, giving their naked behinds a rest from the hot hard dusty pebbly earth! ... but also, by the fact of always standing in such situations being their convention, such behavior would not be taken as giving disrespect and consequently baring a talk on Dhamma. (One doesn't take offence at the behavior of a wild animal, for example.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Aggivessana.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> In other words: a little shady, problematic, a mixed bag.<br />
					<i>"Taɱ p'assa tādisam'eva,||<br />
					taɱ p'assa tādisam'evā" ti.||</i><br />
					that would indeed be a bit of this and a bit of that,,<br />
					that would indeed be a bit of this and a bit of that.'<br />
					Horner: 'This would be like it too, that would be like it too.'<br />
					Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi: 'It too would be the same, it too would be the same.'<br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro: 'it would still be the same, it would still be the same.'<br />
					None of these really make sense.<br />
					"That" or "This" (the commending?) is the same as what? (Is like what 'it'?)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Some other possibilities: In the negative this could be: 'Neither here nor there'; 'Same same'; 'com-si, com-sa'; 'six-of-one, half-a-dozen of the other' 'neither fish nor foul' ... in straight talk this needs to say: 'If it were the fact that I held this opinion of mine to be pleasing, then the fact that I hold this view would be 'a little of this' (holding that things were not pleasing to one) 'and a little of that' (holding that something was pleasing to one), in other words, a confused position that should be abandoned. The following statements of the Buddha show that this is the intended meaning: the error of holding a dual stance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Neither Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi's 'yet they do not abandon that view and they take up still some other view', nor Horner's 'they do not get rid of that very view, and they take up another view' make the idea here clear: that is that 'by' not abandoning this view they take up another view, that is: that this view of theirs that some things are commendable and some things are not commendable is a little of this and a little of that. That is a view. They just add confusion to the confused.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup><i>Bhavaɱ.</i> PED: Bhavant [cp. Sanskrit (and Vedic) bhavant, used as pron. of the 2nd; but constructed with 3rd person of the verb. Probably a contraction from Bhagavant, see Whitney, Altind. Gr. 456] pron. of polite address "Sir, Lord," or "venerable, honourable," or simply "you."<br />
					I hear it more like another way of saying <i>Tathāgata.</i> I.e., from <i>bhava,</i> 'developed one'. So here Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi's 'Master' is closer than Horner's 'Good'. Neither translator comments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Yā hi kho nesaɱ khamati sā'yaɱ diṭṭhi.</i> Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi's 'the view of theirs as to what is acceptable' correctly points to the view, while Horner's 'that which in this view is pleasing to them' mistakenly shifts the object to the thing viewed.<br />
					I see this 'dual view' as a single view with two aspects with the resulting statement meaning: That [aspect] of their view which holds [some things] to be commendable is close to...'<br />
					Ñāṇamoli/Bodhi seem to be saying that these shamans and brahmans hold two opposing views.</p>
