					<h4 class="ctr">Preface</h4>

					<p>The important things to know about <i>kamma</i> are:</p>

					<p>1. <i>Kamma</i> is not a matter of 'an eye for an eye', but is greatly expanded according to the detachment of the actor, the aid to detachment of the deed and the detachment of the recipient.</p>

					<p>2. The consequence of <i>kamma</i> accords with the intent with which it was created in terms of sensation. It is not the form which dictates the result.</p>

					<p>3. The escape from <i>kamma</i> is found in the understanding of the consequences. Understanding here is not just a matter of intellectual knowledge, it is a matter of knowing through experience. Under-standing. To know that which underlies, stands under the intellectual knowledge.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[ <a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a> ]</sup> This means that while Samiddhi's answer was not exactly wrong in ultimate terms in that the eventual outcome as seen by Buddhists is that as a consequence of the attachment involved, even pleasant consequences of action come to an end bringing Pain, what was needed was to point out this more expanded way of seeing things to the Wanderer so as to make the <i>Dhamma</i> more palatable to him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The <i>Pāḷi</i> is: <i>'abhabba/bhabba'.</i> I have not found a one-word translation that really works for this. The (PED) dictionary would have it as 'impossible kamma that looks impossible', etc., but this kamma is not impossible. If we go back to the root, it is 'bhū' 'being' or 'earthly' which makes no sense here. Lord Chalmers uses 'inoperative/operative', but the kamma spoken of is not inoperative. Horner follows Lord Chalmers. Bhk. Ñanamoli, uses 'capable/incapable' and brackets '(of good results)'. Bhk. Thanissaro first follows Bhk. Ñanamoli, then in his revised work uses 'ineffectual/effectual'; but again this kamma is not ineffectual. Sister Upalavanna uses 'impossible/possible'. I have unhappily ignored the <i>Pāḷi</i> and gone for a translation which reflects meaning only.</p>
