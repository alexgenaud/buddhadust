					<p class="f4">In this case one should think about the situation This Way:</p>

					<p class="f4">The First Case:<br />
					1. If there will be no grief and aggravation for myself;<br />
					2. And there will be no grief and aggravation for the other;<br />
					3. And the other is by nature not angry, temperamental, touchy and resentful of instruction;<br />
					4. And is quick witted and easy to convince;<br />
					5. And I have the skill to raise him from a low path to a high one;<br />
					6. It is proper to speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Second Case:
					1. If there will be no grief and aggravation for myself;<br />
					2. But there will be grief and aggravation for the other;<br />
					3. Because the other is by nature angry, temperamental, touchy and resentful of instruction;<br />
					4. But is quick witted and easy to convince;<br />
					5. And I have the skill to raise him from a low path to a high one;<br />
					6. It is proper to speak, because the other's aggravation is a small thing compared to the importance of him being brought from a low path to a high one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Third Case:<br />
					1. If there will be grief and aggravation for myself;<br />
					2. But there will be no grief and aggravation for the other;<br />
					3. Because the other is by nature not angry, temperamental, touchy and resentful of instruction;<br />
					4. But is slow witted and hard to convince;<br />
					5. But I have the skill to raise him from a low path to a high one;<br />
					6. It is proper to speak, because my aggravation is a small thing compared to the importance of him being brought from a low path to a high one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Fourth Case:<br />
					1. If there will be grief and aggravation for myself;<br />
					2. And there will be grief and aggravation for the other;<br />
					3. Because the other is by nature angry, temperamental, touchy and resentful of instruction;<br />
					4. And is slow witted and hard to convince;<br />
					5. But I have the skill to raise him from a low path to a high one;<br />
					6. It is proper to speak, because my aggravation and his aggravation is a small thing compared to the importance of him being brought from a low path to a high one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Fifth Case:<br />
					1. If there will be grief and aggravation for myself;<br />
					2. And there will be grief and aggravation for the other;<br />
					3. Because the other is by nature angry, temperamental, touchy and resentful of instruction;<br />
					4. And is slow witted and hard to convince;<br />
					5. And I do not have the skill to raise him from a low path to a high one;<br />
					6. Then the advantages of an attitude of Objective Detachment should be considered with regard to this individual.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The specific circumstances in which this comes up in this sutta is in the case of a Bhikkhu who has committed some sort of offense. The instructions have a wider application in any situation where one sees another holding on to wrong view.</p>
