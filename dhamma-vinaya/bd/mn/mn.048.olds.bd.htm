					<p>Do friendly acts of body, speech and mind toward my fellow <i>Dhamma</i> seekers increase in me both in public and in private?</p>

					<p>Do I enjoy sharing with my fellow <i>Dhamma</i> seekers whatever material things I have righteously obtained, right down to the bottom of the bowl?</p>

					<p>Do I continuously train myself in those habits of ethical culture which are faultless, spotless, without blemish, freeing, praised by wise men, untarnished, conducive to concentration?</p>

					<p>Do such views as I hold conduce to the goal, are they such as are praised by the Aristocrats, making for the realization of The Way, leading onwards, leading one who follows to the end of <i>Dukkha?</i></p>

					<p>And how is one to determine this concerning one's views?</p>

					<p>By reflecting on one's habits of mind this way:</p>

					<p>Am I personally obsessed by any thing owing to which, I, if my mind were obsessed by it, could not know, could not see things as they really are?</p>

					<p>If one is obsessed by indulgence in sense pleasures, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one is obsessed by anger, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one is obsessed by lazy ways and inertia, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one is obsessed by fear and trembling, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one is obsessed by doubt, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one focuses one's attention on worldly matters, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one focuses one's attention on the world beyond, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one lives with one's fellow <i>Dhamma</i> seekers disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, lives wounding with the weapons of the tongue, this is such an obsession of mind.</p>

					<p>If one knows of one's self: I have no such obsession not got rid of, owing to which I, if my mind were obsessed by it, could not know, could not see things as they really are, this is the first knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning.</p>

					<p>And again he reflects on himself:</p>

					<p>Do I, when following, developing, cultivating such views gain calm, gain dying down?</p>

					<p>If one knows of one's self: I, when following, developing, cultivating such views gain calm, gain dying down, this is the second knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning.</p>

					<p>And again he reflects:</p>

					<p>Am I aware of another Teacher, Sorcerer or Brahmin, God or Man outside of this system who, teaches such views?</p>

					<p>If he knows: 'I am not aware of another Teacher, Sorcerer or Brahmin, God or Man outside this system who teaches such views,' this is the third knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning.</p>

					<p>And again he reflects:</p>

					<p>"Am I possessed of such conformity with <i>Dhamma</i> as indicates an individual who has such views?"</p>

					<p>And what is it that indicates an individual who has such conformity with <i>Dhamma?</i></p>

					<p>Whatever kind of offence he falls into he acts quickly to remove it, he confesses it, discloses it, declares it quickly to the Teacher or to intelligent fellow Brahma-farers; and having confessed, disclosed and declared it, he comes to restraint in the future.</p>

					<p>If he knows: 'I am possessed of such conformity with <i>Dhamma</i> as indicates an individual who has such views,' this is the fourth knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning."</p>

					<p>And again he reflects:</p>

					<p>"Am I further possessed of such conformity with <i>Dhamma</i> as indicates an individual who has such views?"</p>

					<p>And what is it that further indicates an individual who has such conformity with <i>Dhamma?</i></p>

					<p>If sucha one is zealous concerning the many things which should be done for fellow seekers, he becomes highly motivated to seek out even higher moral habit, higher mental development, greater wisdom.</p>

					<p>If he knows: 'I am such a one who is zealous concerning the many things which should be done for fellow seekers, and am highly motivated to seek out even higher moral habit, higher mental development and greater wisdom,' this is the fifth knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning.</p>

					<p>And again he reflects:</p>

					<p>"Am I possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with such views?</p>

					<p>And what kind of strength is that? In the case of this case, while the <i>Tathāgata's Dhamma</i> and Discipline are being taught he applies himself, pays attention, concentrates with all his mind, and listens to <i>Dhamma</i> with ready ear.</p>

					<p>If he knows: 'I am such a one who is possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with such views,'" this is the sixth knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning.</p>

					<p>And again he reflects:</p>

					<p>"Am I further possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with such views?</p>

					<p>And what kind of strength is that? In the case of this case, while the <i>Tathāgata's Dhamma</i> and Discipline are being taught he acquires knowledge of the goal, he acquires knowledge of <i>Dhamma,</i> he acquires the enthusiasm associated with <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p>If he knows: 'I am such a one who is further possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with such views,' this is the seventh knowledge that one has gained that is truly Aristocratic, unworldly, higher than that of the common man, a factor of Streamwinning, when realized, the fruit of Streamwinning.</p>

					<p>Examining in this way, Beggars, one is examining well the seven factors of Streamwinning; possessing these seven one has won the seven fruits of Streamwinning.</p>
