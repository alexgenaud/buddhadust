					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man, <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town,</a><br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta Grove,<br />

					<p class="f4">There then Old Man <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/maha_cunda.htm">Mahā Cunda</a><br />
					at even-tide rising up from his own line of pursuits<br />
					drew near to the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near, giving salutation, he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Old Man Mahā Cunda said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Whatever are, <i>Bhante,</i> those variously-composed views appearing in the world<br />
					reflecting a self yoked to experience of self or<br />
					reflecting a self yoked to experience of the world — <br />
					is it possible to let go such views,<br />
					is it possible to reject such views,<br />
					at the very start of a beggars making of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever are, Cunda, those variously-composed views appearing in the world<br />
					reflecting a self yoked to experience of self or<br />
					reflecting a self yoked to experience of the world — <br />
					wherever these views appear, and<br />
					wherever they follow in consequence, and<br />
					wherever they are in use,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"This is not mine,"<br />
					"This is not me,"<br />
					"This is not my self,"<br />
					seeing whatever it is<br />
					as it is<br />
					with consummate wisdom,<br />
					it is possible to let go such views,<br />
					it is possible to reject such views.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then further, Cunda, there is this situation to be seen:<br />
