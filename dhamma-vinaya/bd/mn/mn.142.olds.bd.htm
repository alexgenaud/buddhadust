					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">{1}</span> Once upon a time<br />
					The Lucky Man was revisiting the Sakkyans,<br />
					Kapilavatthu town,<br />
					Nigrodha's Forest Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī,<br />
					bringing newly woven garments,<br />
					approached The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached The Lucky Man,<br />
					having exchanged greetings,<br />
					she took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">{<a id="p2" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.142.pali.bd.htm#p2">2</a>}</span> "Here, <i>Bhante,</i><br />

					made by myself,<br />
					woven by myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">May, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> accept them,<br />
					out of mercy for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">This said,<br />
					The Lucky Man said this to Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Give this to the <i>Saṇgha,</i> Gotami,<br />
					given to the <i>Saṇgha,</i><br />
					it will become a service to me<br />
					as well as the <i>Saṇgha.</i>"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br />
					Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					are garments newly woven for <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					made by myself,<br />
					woven by myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">May, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> accept them,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then a second time,<br />
					The Lucky Man said this to Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Give this to the <i>Saṇgha,</i> Gotami,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time<br />
					Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />

					<p class="f4">"Accept, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī's newly woven garments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of great service, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					was Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī, to <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					as maternal aunt,<br />
					she did much for him,<br />
					nourished him with milk,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is owing to <i>Bhagava</i>, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					that Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />
					goes to the Buddha for refuge,<br />
					goes to the <i>Dhamma</i> for refuge,<br />
					goes to the <i>Saṇgha</i> for refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was owing to <i>Bhagava</i>, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					that Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />
					abstains from taking the life of living beings,<br />
					abstains from taking the not-given,<br />
					abstains from carrying on sense-pleasures in a low way,<br />
					abstains from neglectful speech,<br />
					abstains from the stupefaction that results<br />
					from drinking the various beers, wines, and alcohols<br />
					whether fermented or distilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to <i>Bhagava</i>, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					that Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />
					is possessed of absolute confidence in the Buddha,<br />
					is possessed of absolute confidence in the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					is possessed of absolute confidence in the <i>Saṇgha,</i><br />
					is possessed of those ethics favored by the Aristocrats.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to <i>Bhagava</i>, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					that Mahā-Pajāpatī Gotamī<br />
					is without doubt regarding pain,<br />
					is without doubt regarding the origin of pain,<br />
					is without doubt regarding the end of pain,<br />
					is without doubt regarding the walk to walk to the end of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, <i>Bhante,</i> is <i>Bhagava</i><br />
