					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ratta</i> = Night, the beginning of the Ancient Indian day. I don't buy the translation of this term as 'attachment'. First off, see verse five and then ponder the focus on the present day. Then, neither the verses nor the analysis hint of attachment as the subject. The idea, as I hear it, is that letting go of the past, not making plans for the future, one attends to the comprehension of the day at hand, cultivating insight into transience, pain and not-self through seeing its having been own-made and finding stability in such perception one is considered to have had a lucky day.</p>
