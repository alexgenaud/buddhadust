					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta Grove,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding:<br />
					"Broke Tooth!"<br />

						<h4 class="ctr">One Lucky Day<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></h4>

						<p class="f4 ctr">Turn not again to what is past,<br />

						<p class="f4 ctr">Let go the past,<br />
						and futures not yet come.</p>

						<p class="f4 ctr">But do research<br />
						those things appearing here,</p>

						<p class="f4 ctr">And drawn not in, nor shaken by<br />

						<p class="f4 ctr">This Very Day in duty's doing, burning<br />
						for certain good; — for sure is death tomorrow;</p>

						<p class="f4 ctr">No pacts are ever made<br />
						with Judgment's great battalions! —</p>

						<p class="f4 ctr">Live you therefore ardent,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In brief, the analysis goes:</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning again to the past means reminiscing about and taking pleasure in the recollection of one's past shape, experiences, perceptions, own-makings, and conscious states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hankering after the future means imagining, wishing for, intending to get, and taking pleasure in conjuring up means to get future shape, experience, perception, own-making and conscious states.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not being drawn in or shaken by things of the present means having schooled one's self in the Dhamma, one does not consider shape, experience, perception, own-making, or consciousness as: "This is my self," or "My self has this," or "My self is in this", or "This is in My Self."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ratta</i> = Night, the beginning of the Ancient Indian day. I don't buy the translation of this term as 'attachment'. First off, see verse five and then ponder the focus on the present day. Then, neither the verses nor the analysis hint of attachment as the subject. The idea, as I hear it, is that letting go of the past, not making plans for the future, one attends to the comprehension of the day at hand, cultivating insight into transience, pain and not-self through seeing it's having been man-made (or own-made) and finding stability in such perception one is considered to have had a lucky day.</p>
