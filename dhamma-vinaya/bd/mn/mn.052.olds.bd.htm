					<h4 class="ctr">Introduction</h4>					
					
					<p class="f4">This sutta often figures in the discussion concerning whether or not the <i>jhānas</i> are necessary for awakening. Here the interesting thing is that a careful reading of the sutta tells us that it is not really the <i>jhānas</i> or the <i>Brahma-viharas,</i> or the formless realms that bring about <i>Nibbāna,</i> but that these must all be seen as made for the sake of (with the intent of creating) identified-with experience, and must be let go.</p>
										
					<p class="f4">The conclusion is that the <i>Magga</i> is only one of several different paths that lead one to the point where, by eradicating the <i>Āsavas,<sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup> Nibbāna</i> can be reached by letting that path go. Each individual path separately, or the first <i>jhāna</i> only, or the full set of four, or the other paths or all of them togethe are all sufficient to bring one to this position. From the viewpoint of the Arahant they will all be seen as equivalants; the differences between them would be seen as constructed to meet the differences in the dispositions of individuals.</p>
