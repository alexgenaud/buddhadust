					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, does a beggar live observing the body through the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar, having gotten himself off to the forest or to the root of some tree, or to some empty hut, and having taken up his seat there sitting down, body upright, legs bent-across-lapwise<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>, and having set up satisfaction around the face,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> just so minds the in-breath, just so minds the out breath.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths in deeply, he knows: 'I am breathing in deeply.'<br />
					If he breaths out deeply, he knows: 'I am breathing out deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths in shallowly, he knows: 'I am breathing in shallowly.'<br />

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on the experience of<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> all body, I will breath in,' this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Observing all body, I will breath out,' this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> bodily own-making, I will breath in,' this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Pacifying bodily own-making, I will breath out,' this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as the spinner,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> beggars, or his apprentice, in pulling long knows: 'I am pulling long.'<br />
					in pulling short knows: 'I am pulling short'<br />
					Even so, beggars, a beggar if he breaths in deeply, knows: 'I am breathing in deeply.'<br />
					If he breaths out deeply, knows: 'I am breathing out deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths in shallowly, he knows: 'I am breathing in shallowly.'<br />

					<p class="f4">'Observing all body, I will breath in,' this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Observing all body, I will breath out,' this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying the own-body, I will breath in,' this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Pacifying the own-body, I will breath out,' this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he lives observing body, through body with regard to the self<br />
					or he lives observing body, through body with regard to externals<br />
					or he lives observing body, through body with regard to himself and externals.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Or he lives observing body, through the origins of things,<br />
					or he lives observing body, through the aging of things,<br />
					or he lives observing body, through the origins and aging of things.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Or thinking: 'This is body' he sets up minding just enough to get a measure of knowledge, a measure of recollectedness.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he lives observing but does not grasp after things of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Even so, beggars, a beggar lives observing body, through body.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars, deeper than that, a beggar, having got going, knows: 'I have gotten going,'<br />
					standing, knows: 'I am standing,'<br />
					sitting, knows: 'I am sitting,'<br />
					lying down, knows: 'I am lying down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars, deeper than that, a beggar, departing or returning does it with cognizance;<br />
					looking at or looking the other way, he does it with cognizance;<br />
					stretching or flexing, he does it with cognizance;<br />
					wearing cloak, bowl and upper-robe he does it with cognizance;<br />
					eating, drinking, biting, or tasting he does it with cognizance;<br />
					Passing matter or passing water he does it with cognizance;<br />
					On the go, standing, sitting, asleep or awake, speaking or becoming silent he does it with cognizance.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he lives observing body, through body with regard to the self<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars, deeper than that, a beggar, reflects on this body encased by skin as filled from the top of the tips of the hairs of the head above to the bottom of the soles of the feet below with diverse sorts of putrid filth, thinking:<br />

The other camp is made up of those who are trying to figure out how to say this in such a way that it does not imply that this practice or system is the one and only way (like the field/ground studies in psychology; they fail to see that this method is just a restatement of the same method used throughout the suttas, that is to say, essentially, the Four Truths). I have got a completely differnt take. The Buddha himself, no doubt anticipating this very debate, has suggested how to arrive at the meaning. He tells us straight out that it was because this way leads one who even only practices [perfectly] for seven days to either non-returning or Arahantship in this very life. It's got only one goal. It has a very narrow scope. The outcome is sure. Take a look; in one way we can say that the entire sutta is constructed so as to explain the meaning of 'ekayano'. This is [pick one]; a way to overcome dukkha; culminating in non-returning or higher.<br />

					Bhk. Nanavira and Bhk. Nanamoli also see the meaning of this term approximately as I have it here. See: Nanavira, 'ekayano'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup><i>Parimukhaɱ satiɱ upaṭṭhapetvā.</i> Whatever the translators of this phrase finally agree on, this means in practice that the meditator is to make sure (mind) that the various muscles associated with (pari — around) the organs of the face (mukham) (especially around the eyes, at the corners of the nose and mouth, and the set of the teeth) are as free from tension as possible.<br />
					Woodward translates: "setting mindfulness in front of him" and interprets according to the hindu-yoga tradition "Between the eyebrows, where the Hindus place the brow-cakram." Bhikkhu Bodhi translates: "set up mindfulness in front of him" and quotes commentary: "...Vibh 252,14-16 says: 'This mindfulness is set up, well set up at the tip of the nose or at the centre of the upper lip.'<br />
					<b><i>Path of Purity</i></b>: <i>"Establishing his mindfulness in front"</i> means, setting his mindfulness in the direction of the subject of meditation. Or, <i>pari</i> (in <span  class="mozp"><i>parimukhaɱ</i></span> "in front") has the meaning of "grasping all round"; <i>mukhaɱ</i> of "going out from"; <i>sati</i> (mindfulness) of "being present," and it is therefore said to be <i><span  class="mozp">parimukhaɱ sati</span></i>. The meaning is to be taken here according to the version of the Paṭisambhidā, [i, 176] of which the folllowing is an abstract: setting up mindfulness concerning a going forth which is thoroughly grasped."<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup>Bhamakāro. "string-maker" or 'spin-maker'. Walshe, Rhys Davids, Bhk. Thanissaro, Horner and others: 'Turner'. This could be a lute player (? long note, short note); a turner (lathe worker) or potter (also called a turner), both giving difficulty with the idea of pulling long or short (the lathe or potting wheel is turned by pulling on a rope wound round a spindle that reverses gears when the rope has been fully pulled out and allowed to rewind around the spindle thus allowing a second pull...but there is nothing in the mechanism that would allow for short or long pulls; a top (toy) spinner, also with issues with regard to the long and short pulls; or we could just take the word at face value and say this is a spinner (of yarn or thread, i.e., sutta — where now it it necessary to pull out the wool long, and where now it is necessary to pull out the wool only slightly). Two appeal to me: The Potter because of the relation to a sub-meaning of Bhagava; and 'spinner' because of the relationship to 'spinning' a 'sutta' (string, story, or spell). But did spinners have apprentices?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup>The brain is not included in all versions of this list. I hear it was only inserted by those following the commentary. Here I am going to side with the commentary for once. This is at one level a joke. Here I think the commentator had vision. He got the joke (The location of the brain — Where most people's minds are located; 'His mind is in the gutter' is how it is often put in English.). This idea is reflected elsewhere in similes. For example below in the charnal ground images there is one (#??) that describes the bones, now scattered, with the skull located at the pelvis; this occurs again in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.olds.bd.htm#p9">SN:NV. 17:9</a> where the bird that is torn apart has it's head located at it's tail feathers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup>This is another 'joke'. We in the modern west, with our flushing toilets will have a difficult time relating to this one, but the reader is reminded that when he opens that bag of his at the one end, a few days later what he puts in comes out when he opens up the other end, and a man with eyes in his head that can see can see: 'Here is that rice and beans, here is that potato I swallowed whole, etc.' Please note here also the Freudian-like symbolism of the corn, husked and ready for boiling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup>Fine quality rice husked and with the black grains removed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup>I have reversed the order on the last two sets to follow the usual and instructive way lists are usually ordered in the Pali, that is, proceeding from the lower state to the better state.</p>
