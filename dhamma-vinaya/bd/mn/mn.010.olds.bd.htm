					<p class="f4">It was while there that The Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, does a beggar<br />
					live observing the body through the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar,<br />
					having gotten himself off to the forest<br />
					or to the root of some tree,<br />
					or to some empty hut,<br />
					and having taken up his seat there<br />
					sitting down,<br />
					body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and having set up minding around the mouth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					just so minds the in-breath,<br />
					just so minds the out breath.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths in deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am breathing in deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am breathing out deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths in shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am breathing in shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am breathing out shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on the experience of<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> everything bodily, I will breath in,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Observing everything bodily, I will breath out,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> bodily own-making, I will breath in,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying bodily own-making, I will breath out,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as the spinner,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> beggars,<br />
					or his apprentice,<br />
					in pulling long knows:<br />
					'I am pulling long,'<br />
					in pulling short knows:<br />
					'I am pulling short,'<br />
					even so, beggars, a beggar<br />
					if he breaths in deeply, knows:<br />
					'I am breathing in deeply,'<br />
					if he breaths out deeply, knows:<br />
					'I am breathing out deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths in shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am breathing in shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am breathing out shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Observing everything bodily, I will breath in,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Observing everything bodily, I will breath out,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying the own-body, I will breath in,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying the own-body, I will breath out,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he lives observing body, through body<br />
					with regard to the self<br />
					or he lives observing body, through body<br />

					or he lives observing body, through body<br />
					with regard to himself and externals.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Or he lives observing body,<br />

					or he lives observing body,<br />
					through the origins and aging of things.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Or thinking:<br />
					'This is body'<br />
					he sets up minding<br />
					just enough to get a measure of knowledge,<br />
					a measure of recollectedness.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Thus he lives observing<br />
					but does not grasp after things of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4 in1">Even so, beggars,<br />
					a beggar lives observing body through body.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars, deeper than that, a beggar, having got going, knows: 'I have gotten going,'<br />
					standing, knows: 'I am standing,'<br />
					sitting, knows: 'I am sitting,'<br />
					lying down, knows: 'I am lying down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in suchwise as he manages the body<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars, deeper than that,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> 'I'm just tell'n you what I'm hearing. The story most people have heard is that this line (<i>Evam me Sutam</i> — usually translated 'Thus I have heard') was originally spoken by Ānanda at the first council as he recited from memory all he had heard. There is another story. This is the way a seer will begin when he is going to tell you what he has 'heard' in his meditations on a certain subject. In this translation I am going to tell you what I hear in this way but 'reflected off' — <i>(as it carefully adheres to)</i> the 'script' we have in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.22.pali.bd.htm">the Pali version</a> of this spell. For those who are curious about how this spell sounds [to my ear] now, <i>without</i> reference to the Pali (It was written entirely from memory of how it was 'heard' while meditating on understanding the sutta as a sutta) check out <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#PartII">The Great Master's Satisfaction Pastures.</a> 'ere goes me ear'n!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> I hear this spell (or the spell that was originally delivered as this spell) was cast in front of an audience of a thousand seers on what in the USA would be known as Haloween Night.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Ekāyano.</i> It is almost obligatory for a translator of the <i>Satipatthana</i> to footnote this term. It is clear that the two camps are: 1. those who would wish to suggest that not only was This Practice The One and Only Way (among thousands and thousands described in the suttas ... which do, it is true, all come down to the same method) but that by extension Buddhism is the one and only way. Others that fall into this 'one and only way' camp include those who would rather not have to wade through the other 83,999 suttas of the Tipitaka. The other camp is made up of those who are trying to figure out how to say this in such a way that it does not imply that this practice or system is the one and only way (like the field/ground studies in psychology; they fail to see that this method is just a restatement of the same method used throughout the suttas, that is to say, essentially, the Four Truths). I have got a completely differnt take. The Buddha himself, no doubt anticipating this very debate, has suggested how to arrive at the meaning. He tells us straight out that it was because this way leads one who even only practices [perfectly] for seven days to either non-returning or Arahantship in this very life. It's got only one goal. It has a very narrow scope. The outcome is sure. Take a look; in one way we can say that the entire sutta is constructed so as to explain the meaning of <i>'ekayano'.</i> This is [pick one]; a way to overcome <i>dukkha;</i> culminating in non-returning or higher.<br />
					[If practiced impeccably.]<br />
					On the other hand, for a different take on what is going on here, see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.001.olds.bd.htm#n2">SN 5.54.1, n.2</a><br />
					Bhk. Nanavira and Bhk. Nanamoli also see the meaning of this term approximately as I have it here. See: Nanavira, <i>'ekayano'.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.001.olds.bd.htm#n3">See SN 5.54.1, n3</a> and see '<a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/bag/high_getting_high/the_seat/seat.htm">The Seat</a>'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Parimukhaɱ satiɱ upaṭṭhapetvā.</i> Whatever the translators of this phrase finally agree on, this means in practice that the meditator is to make sure (mind) that the various muscles associated with (pari — around) the organs of the face (mukham) (especially around the eyes, at the corners of the nose and mouth, and the set of the teeth) are as free from tension as possible.<br />
					Woodward translates: "setting mindfulness in front of him" and interprets according to the hindu-yoga tradition "Between the eyebrows, where the Hindus place the brow-<i>cakram</i>." Bhikkhu Bodhi translates: "set up mindfulness in front of him" and quotes commentary: "...Vibh 252,14-16 says: 'This mindfulness is set up, well set up at the tip of the nose or at the centre of the upper lip.'<br />
					<b><i>Path of Purity</i></b>: <i>"Establishing his mindfulness in front"</i> means, setting his mindfulness in the direction of the subject of meditation. Or, <i>pari</i> (in <i>parimukhaɱ</i> "in front") has the meaning of "grasping all round"; <i>mukhaɱ</i> of "going out from"; <i>sati</i> (mindfulness) of "being present," and it is therefore said to be <i>parimukhaɱ sati</i>. The meaning is to be taken here according to the version of the <i>Paṭisambhidā,</i> [i, 176] of which the folllowing is an abstract: setting up mindfulness concerning a going forth which is thoroughly grasped."<br />
					For further discussion of this phrase see: DhammaTalk, Give Ear, <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/remembering_sati.htm#fn3">Remembering Sati</a> and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.olds.bd.htm">See SN 54</a><br />
					As of this time [Tuesday, March 17, 2020 12:40 PM] I am convinced that the best way to see this is to see it as a spectrum of foci that goes thus: Mind the mouth, mind the face, mind the front (or the interface between the internal and the external; and mind what you are about (that is, that you are setting up minding). Both in the foreward direction and in the reverse; ending at minding the interface and remembering to let it all go.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.001.olds.bd.htm#n5">See SN 54.10.1, n5</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Bhamakāro.</i> "string-maker" or 'spin-maker'. Walshe, Rhys Davids, Bhk. Thanissaro, Horner and others: 'Turner'. This could be a lute player (? long note, short note); a turner (lathe worker) or potter (also called a turner), both giving difficulty with the idea of pulling long or short (the lathe or potting wheel is turned by pulling on a rope wound round a spindle that reverses gears when the rope has been fully pulled out and allowed to rewind around the spindle thus allowing a second pull...but there is nothing in the mechanism that would allow for short or long pulls; a top (toy) spinner, also with issues with regard to the long and short pulls; or we could just take the word at face value and say this is a spinner (of yarn or thread, i.e., sutta — where now it it necessary to pull out the wool long, and where now it is necessary to pull out the wool only slightly). Two appeal to me: The Potter because of the relation to a sub-meaning of Bhagava; and 'spinner' because of the relationship to 'spinning' a 'sutta' (string, story, or spell). But did spinners have apprentices?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The brain is not included in all versions of this list. I hear it was only inserted by those following the commentary. Here I am going to side with the commentary for once. This is at one level a joke. Here I think the commentator had vision. He got the joke (The location of the brain — Where most people's minds are located; 'His mind is in the gutter' is how it is often put in English.). This idea is reflected elsewhere in similes. For example below in the charnal ground images there is one that describes the bones, now scattered, with the skull located at the pelvis; this occurs again in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.olds.bd.htm#p9">SN: 2.17:9</a> where the bird that is torn apart has it's head located at it's tail feathers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This is another 'joke'. We in the modern west, with our flushing toilets will have a difficult time relating to this one, but the reader is reminded that when he opens that bag of his at the one end, a few days later what he puts in comes out when he opens up the other end, and a man with eyes in his head that can see can see: 'Here is that rice and beans, here is that potato I swallowed whole, etc.' Please note here also the Freudian-like symbolism of the corn, husked and ready for boiling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Fine quality rice husked and with the black grains removed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> I have reversed the order on the last two sets to follow the usual and instructive way lists are usually ordered in the Pali, that is, proceeding from the lower state to the better state.</p>
