					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ora-m-bhāgiya saṃyojanānī.</i> Yokes, which obsessed over by the self, bind to the lower worlds: The <i>rūpa lokas,</i> worlds characterized by form. Hell, animal birth, demonic births, ghostly births, human birth and birth in the lowest heavenly realms: the Four Kings of the Four Directions, beings that reside with the gods of the Chamber of the Three and Thirty, beings that reside in Yama's Paradise, beings that resides with the gods of the Heaven of Delight (the <i>Tusita</i> realm), beings that reside with the gods of Creation (<i>Nimmanarati</i>), beings that reside with the gods of Manipulation (<i>paranimmita-vasavati</i>). Obsession with the first three of these yokes must be given up to attain Streamwining.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> His error is that the way he has phrased it, is saying that this and the other yokes are the problem whereas the real problem is the obsession with them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These things, though latent (maybe "latent" is not the best word that could be found for the background state of these things; they are "sub-conscious", "minimally conscious") in the infant, were the things obsessed with which the individual came to rebirth in the first place. How could they not be there, however latent, in an infant? This is correctly translated by Ms. Horner; the other translators have these things as missing in the infant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Sakkāya-diṭṭhi.</i> <i>'Sakkāya'</i> = 'own-body'. The 'own' part is <i>'saka';</i> <i>'kāya'</i> is body, in all the senses of the word in English but with the primary meaning not of the physical human body but of the grouping together and identification with the <i>khandhas,</i> (<i>rūpa:</i> form; <i>vedanā:</i> sense experience; <i>saññā:</i> perception; <i>saṇkhārā:</i> own-making, the making of ones own personal world; <i>viññāṇa:</i> re-knowing-knowing-knowledge, re-knowing-knowing-knowledge, awareness of knowing) so the meaning is, for some sorts of beings, more along the lines of 'personal world'. To hold on to one way of seeing things as being the one true way of seeing them is <i>"ditthi".</i> Both Rhys Davids and Hare: error of permanent individual entity; Hare: delusion of self; Horner: own-body view; <i>Bhk.</i> Punnaji: self-concept, personalized self, personality perspective; <i>Bhks:</i> Bodhi and Ñanamoli: personality view; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: self-identity views; Walshe: personality-belief; Woodward: individual group.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This is somewhat obscurely put. I think the way to think about this is to imagine the being that has been reborn as standing away from the infant, obsessed with these matters, but that the infant is not yet in sync with the individual he will become. Our difficulty in thinking of this comes from not having a belief in rebirth which would explain the presence of these issues in the new-born infant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Here <i>"Dhammas"</i> means any way of thinking about things that involves the idea of "this is the right way to see things." The right "form." The reference is probably to "Views", that is: There is giving, there is sacrifice, there is having sacrificed, there is pleasurable and painful fruitional result of <i>kamma,</i> there is this world, there is the other world, there is mother, there is father, there is spontaneous birth, there are in this world shaman or Brahman that have attained the consummate reach for themselves, and knowing this world and the world beyond, are able to make it known and realized.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup>Here <i>"Dhamma"</i> refers specifically to the teachings of Gotama, the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> "The real escape" means the letting go of the obsession with these things; the letting go that is the result of following the <i>Magga</i> (Consummate views, principles, talk, works, lifestyle, effort at self control, mind, serenity, knowledge and vision. For the details of these, see the end of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22</a>.) It is necessary to understand this to make sense of what follows.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> With the exception of obsession with rituals, this may seem strange. Are we to give up ethical standards and doing good works? First understand that it is the obsession that is to be got rid of. The error here is thinking that these things will bring and end to pain. Then the intentional doing is got rid of because there is no ending of <i>kamma</i> without also the ending of intentional doings. In the early part of ones training one is encouraged to give, do good deeds etc. and to bring ones behavior into line with high ethical standards. Here one can see the intent of the sutta where it speaks of obsession with the disadvantages of these things without saying that these things are (can be!) eliminated. The harm comes from the attachment, not the thing itself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Note the difference here in the formula for the first <i>jhāna.</i> It usually does not contain "letting go of all bodily wickedness, thoroughly impassive" <i>(pahānā sabbaso kāya-du-ṭ-ṭhullānaṃ paṭipassaddhiyā).</i> The other <i>jhānas</i> are either not spelled out or are the same as usual. It seems to me to be an emphasis on body which would be appropriate for the discussion of own-body-identification.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The three being change, pain, and not-self. This looks like it has been tampered with. The original was likely just the three by themselves, the rest being added "for clarity."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This sutta is not so much about attaining arahantship, though the latter portion speaks of destroying the corrupting influences. It is primarily speaking about falling a little short of arahantship, that is, only of the five yokes that lead to spontaneous rebirth in some realm where <i>Nibbāna</i> would be the next step. Arahantship requires that all ten of the yokes be broken (the five spoken of here and lust for form <i>(rūpa-rāga),</i> lust for the formless <i>(a-rūpa-rāgo),</i> pride <i>(māna),</i> trembling (from fear and anxiety) <i>(uddhaccan)</i> and blindness <i>(avijjā).</i> Breaking the hold of these would be implied by the statement that the corrupting influences were destroyed. Freedom here is spoken of in the two terms used to describe it of the arahant. The Buddha's answer says "forces" <i>(indriya),</i> not "powers" <i>(balani).</i> The difference is that forces are apart from the will of the individual. They are native attributes presumably the result of previous <i>kamma.</i></p>
