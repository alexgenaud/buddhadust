					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> <i>Uddhumāyikaṃ.</i> <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi and Horner have 'Frog' and 'Toad' referencing commentary. Likely so, but here I think the idiom has internal meaning which is better left in its raw state.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> <i>Dvidhāpathaṃ.</i> PED has forked path, divided path or crossroads. This is a simile for doubt. Uncertainty as to which path to take. One get's rid of doubt but one does not get rid of a forked path, or a crossroads, one takes one or the other fork or direction; one gets rid of a divergent path ... or, maybe, thinking of 'duality' and dualistic thinking, one does get rid of both choices. If it says go this way or go that way, we can say; 'I'll not go either way.' Abstaining from either self-indulgence or self-punishment, I'll take the Middle Path. So my translation means 'Taking the Middle path, I will get rid of any divergent path that presents itself — whether forked or a crossroads.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> <i>Caṅgavāraṃ</i> [<i>cangavāraṃ</i>]. An empty vessel or box. Horner has 'strainer' and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has 'sieve'; both rely on the commentary. If this is a strainer or sieve, it is likely something like the sifting tool gardeners use to filter out rocks, etc; a box that acts as a funnel, with a screen at one end. The PED points to a possible etymology in: <i>Tamil canguvaḍa a dhoney,</i> Anglo-Ind. <i>ḍoni,</i> a canoe hollowed from a log. This would work as a simile for the <i>khandhas</i> (trunk) which is often enough referred to as an empty vessel; and 'strainer' or 'sieve' would work as a simile for the six senses: The eye comes into contact with an object of sense; arising from the contact is sense impression; sense impression is then used as the raw data for the mind sense and the visual component of the composite re-knowing-knowing-knowledge of the world of the individual. If there is no eye, and there is an object of sense present, there is no resultant object re-knowing-knowing-knowledge; if there is eye, but no object, there is no resultant object re-knowing-knowing-knowledge. So in effect the senses act as a filter (sieve) through which the world is perceived. If this is not an error, we need to go with 'sieve', seeing the hindrances as filtering out higher states of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge, insight, and letting go. If the reader has doubt, using a sword, dig it out, get rid of all three.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> <i>Kummo.</i> Horner and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'tortoise.' When this animal is used as a simile it is most often the variety that inhabits water; this variety is now more commonly known as a turtle.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup></span> <i>Nāga.</i> Ms. Horner (?following Chalmers?) translates as "cobra" which is not incorrect, though likely misleading on the grounds that this will be heard by anyone interested in Eastern Religions as "Kundalini" and will bring in sexual or tantric connotations.</p>
