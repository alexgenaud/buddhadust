					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup></span> <i>Uddhumāyikaɱ.</i> Bhk. Bodhi and Horner have 'Frog' and 'Toad' referencing commentary. Likely so, but here I think the idiom has internal meaning which is better left in it's raw state.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup></span> <i>Dvidhāpathaɱ.</i> PED has forked path, divided path or crossroads. This is a simile for doubt. Uncertainty as to which path to take. One get's rid of doubt but one does not get rid of a forked path, or a crossroads, one takes one or the other fork or direction; one gets rid of a divergent path...or, maybe, thinking of 'duality' and dualistic thinking, one does get rid of both choices. If it says go this way or go that way, we can say; 'I'll not go either way.' Abstaining from either self-indulgence or self-punishment, I'll take the Middle Path. So my translation means 'Taking the Middle path, I will get rid of any divergent path that presents itself — whether forked or a crossroads.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup></span> <i>Caŋgavāraɱ</i> [<i>cangavāraɱ</i>]. An empty vessel or box. Horner has 'strainer' and Bhk. Bodhi has 'seive'; both rely on the commentary. If this is a strainer or sieve, it is likely something like the sifting tool gardners use to filter out rocks, etc; a box that acts as a funnel, with a screen at one end. The PED points to a possible etymology in: Tamil canguvaḍa a dhoney, Anglo-Ind. ḍoni, a canoe hollowed from a log. This would work as a simile for the kkhandhas (trunk) which is often enough referred to as an empty vessel; and 'strainer' or 'seive' would work as a simile for the six senses: The eye comes into contact with an object of sense arising from the contact is sense impression; sense impression is then used as the raw data for the mind sense and the visual component of the composite consciousness of the world of the individual. If there is no eye, and there is an object of sense present, there is no resultant object consciousness; if there is eye, but no object, there is no resultant object consciousness. So in effect the senses act as a filter (seive) through which the world is perceived. If this is not an error, we need to go with 'sieve', seeing the hindrances as filtering out higher states of consciousness, insight, and letting go. If the reader has doubt, using a sword, dig it out, get rid of all three.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup></span> <i>Kummo.</i> Horner and Bhk. Bodhi: 'tortoise.' When this animal is used as a simile it is most often the variety that inhabits water; this variety is now more commonly known as a turtle.</p>
