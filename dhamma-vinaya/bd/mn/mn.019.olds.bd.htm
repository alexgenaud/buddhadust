					      <p class="f4 in2">Misguided views,<br />

					      misguided mind,<br />

					<p class="f4"><i>'Domesticated male',</i><br />
					this then beggars, is a word for delighting in lust.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'Domesticated female',</i><br />
					this then beggars, is a word for blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'Some person desiring their gain,<br />

					this then beggars, is a word for the <i>Tathāgata</i>,<br />
					Aristocrat,<br />
					the consummately self-awakened one.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'The Way leading to well-being',</i><br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Vyāpāda</i> and <i>avyāpāda</i> <i>vya</i> = via; <i>pada</i> = path; and not via path. Usually translated 'ill will' 'malevolence'. The problem with that being that there is nothing in the word that speaks of ill-will or malevolence. I see Rhys Davids asking some Sri Lankan <i>bhikkhu</i> to explain the word and hearing 'Well its whatever does not follow the path, ill-will, malevolence, anger, hate ..." Deviance, not following the path, and 'straight', following the path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">While <i>'dhammas'</i> are the objects of the Mind sense, translating this term as 'mind state' is too narrow and additionally transgresses on the territory covered by <i>'citta'. "Dhammas"</i> are 'things' 'phenomena' and in this case the simile points to their meaning as 'thoughts'. The thoughts that at first needed to be checked and controlled but which at a time when there was no further danger from them only required the needful: that is to say cognizance thereof as being: 'Just things.'</p>
