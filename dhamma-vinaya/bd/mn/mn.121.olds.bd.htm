					<p class="f4">There he said:</p>

					in the market town of Nagaraka,<br />
					and I, also, was there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that place,<br />
					I recall having heard, learnt, studied, grasped,<br />
					face-to-face with the Lucky Man,<br />
					this statement made by him:<br />
					"At this time, Ānanda, I reside in the fullness of emptiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Did I hear this correctly?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Ānanda, you heard, learnt, studied, grasped this correctly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Previously, as well as now,<br />

					as this Palace of Migara's Mother<br />
					is empty of the disturbances of the city:<br />
					empty of elephants,<br />
					cows,<br />
					horses asses;<br />
					empty of dealings with gold and silver;<br />
					empty of groups of men and women,<br />
					and there is only this that remains to disturb the emptiness:<br />
					that is, the vibration emanating off the Beggars here;<br />
					in the same way, a Beggar,<br />
					paying no attention to the disturbances of the city,<br />
					paying no attention to human beings,<br />
					pays attention only to the vibration emanating off the forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes to paying attention only to perception of the forest,<br />
					and cleans out,<br />
					tidies up<br />
					and liberates his mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This way there is no disturbance emanating from perception of human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">This way there is only that disturbance which emanates off perception of the forest."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, there is in the case of this case,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the same way as he would regard a bull's hide,<br />
					stretched out to cure,<br />
					held down by a hundred pegs,<br />
					it's life done gone;<br />
					when he pays attention to earth,<br />
					he does not think about anything on earth<br />
					such as dry land<br />
					or rivers<br />
					or swamps<br />
					or marshes with plants with branches and thorns<br />
					or mountains or plains,<br />
					but he only just pays attention to the vibration which emanates off perception of earth.</p>
