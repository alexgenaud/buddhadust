					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way is <i>empty</i> of the disturbance<br />
					emanating from the grip of blindness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness,<br />
					that is the six sense-realms bound to this body<br />
					reacting to life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he regards that which is present<br />

					and, with regard to what remains,<br />
					he understands that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'That being, this is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, there is in the case of this case,<br />
					<i>a sitting-down-to-empty-out</i><br />
					that results in surpassing purity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Pasade &gt; Palace, Balustrade, Terraced house; as we understand it today not much more elegant than what would have been a well constructed two-story adobe home in what we might call an "open space preserve" — a bit of forest nearby town. The Palace was apparently covered top to bottom in precious rugs and cloth coverings.</p>
