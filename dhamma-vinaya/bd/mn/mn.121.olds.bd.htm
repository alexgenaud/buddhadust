					emerging from the evening's solitary abiding,<br />
					went to the Teacher,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, seated to one side there, he said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p3" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.121.pali.bd.htm#p3">3</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.121.horn.pts.htm#p3">pts</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/misc/mn/mn.121.nymo.misc.htm#p3">nymo</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/mn/mn.121.ntbb.wp.htm#p3">ntbb</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/mn/mn.121.than.ati.htm#p3">than</a>]<br />

					The Lucky Man was residing among the Sakyans<br />

					<p class="f4">In that place,<br />

					<p class="f4">'At this time, Ānanda, I reside in the fullness of emptiness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Ānanda, you heard, learnt, studied, grasped this correctly.</p>

					is <i>empty</i> of elephants,<br />
					cows,<br />
					horses asses;<br />
					<i>empty</i> of dealings with gold and silver;<br />
					<i>empty</i> of groups of men and women,<br />
					and there is only this that remains<br />
					to disturb the emptiness:<br />
					that is, the vibration<br />

					in the same way, a Beggar,<br />
					paying no attention<br />

					paying no attention<br />

					pays attention only to<br />
					the vibration emanating from the forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way there is no disturbance<br />
					emanating from the grip of becoming.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way there is no disturbance<br />
					emanating from the grip of blindness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way is empty of the disturbance<br />
					emanating from the grip of sense pleasures.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way is empty of the disturbance<br />

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way is empty of the disturbance<br />
					emanating from the grip of blindness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This way there is only this that disturbs the emptiness,<br />
					that is the six sense-realms bound to this body<br />
					responding to life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he regards that which is present<br />
					as empty of that which is not present,<br />
					and, with regard to what remains,<br />
					he understands that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That being, this is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, there is in the case of this case,<br />
					a sitting-down-to-empty-out<br />
					that results in surpassing purity.</p>

					all of them did so<br />
					by attaining this same highest surpassing purity of emptiness<br />

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, all those shaman or Brahmen<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">And uplifted in mind, Ananda was delighted by the Lucky Man's talk.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Pasade &gt; Palace, Balustrade, Terraced house; as we understand it today not much more elegant than what would have been a well constructed two-story adobe home in what we might call an "open space preserve" — a bit of forest nearby town. The Palace was apparently covered top to bottom in precious rugs and cloth coverings.</p>
