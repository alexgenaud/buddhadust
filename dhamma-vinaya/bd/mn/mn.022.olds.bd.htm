<meta name="description" content="The M. Olds translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 22. A wide-ranging very famous sutta that begins with a forceful teaching on the dangers of indulgence in sense pleasures. This sutta contains two famous similies: the similie of the snake illustrating how a wrong grasp of the Dhamma, is like taking hold of a poisonous snake from the wrong end; and the simile of the raft illustrating how the Dhamma, should be used to attain its ends and then be let go. The sutta concludes with a thorough examination of the way 'not self' should be considered." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Held against the wind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> In the tree, having climbed up and eaten of the fruit one sees another man chopping the tree down to get the fruit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Usmīkato.</i>[ped]: heat-made; [DPL]: MA. ii. 104 "has he the least glimmering of knowledge"; Chalmers: "a spark of illumination"; Horner: "even a glimmering"; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: "even warm"; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: "kindled even a spark of wisdom"; Nyanaponika Thera: "any spark (of understanding"). <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's translation is getting warm to the meaning. He goes back to kindling fire, but this is down the road from that as in the children's game or when someone is coming close to something he is looking for and others comment on his progress. "You're getting warm!" But I have translated this as a degree of liking: "He has warmed to the idea." In other words it is not so much that he has no clue, but he has no appreciation of the meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Ms. Horner forgets that he was already seated, and has him sit down here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Here the editors have clumsily inserted a list of teachings that come much later and by that have put the whole sutta in danger of being dismissed as being 'late.' <i>Suttaṃ geyyaṃ veyyākaraṇaṃ gāthaṃ udānaṃ iti-vuttakaṃ jātakaṃ abbhuta-dhammaṃ vedallaṃ.</i>
					Lord Chalmers (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/chlm/mn/mn.022.chlm.sbb.htm#n3">see his note 3</a>): <i>"the Suttas in prose or in prose and verse, with the Poems and the Triumphant Utterances and the Quotations and the <i>Jātakas</i> and the Miracles and the Miscellanies."</i>
					I have eliminated the list from this translation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Aja-pada.</i> Goat-footed = cloven.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Kullaṃ.</i> A hollow tube. A pontoon, but that does not fit the description. A float would be more accurate than a raft, but the fact is that sometimes history overpowers reality and it would be a disservice to the lesson to switch from 'raft' at this point.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Nissāya.</i> Normally we would see that seated he would not be able to uses his feet, but here I imagine the float to be relatively small ... he does contemplate carrying it. The usual translation, 'depending on' does not help us see the situation ... which is that this is being done by most of us seated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Nissaya.</i> Seating.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>Anupalabbhamāne.</i> Lord Chalmers, and <i>Bhks.</i> Nyanaponika, Thanissaro, Ñanamoli, and Bodhi all understand this to mean that the idea of a self (or soul) has not been proven, or has been disproved and that therefore the idea of an everlasting stable existence is absurd. Ms. Horner is alone in reading this as being an indication that the reality of a self is not the issue, that beyond this issue this theory is bunk.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>Pañc'ora-m-bhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni</i></a><br />
					(<b>1</b>) <i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi,</i> own-body view;<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>Venayika.</i> This is the holding of the view that at the end of a living being's lifespan there is nothing further. Professed beliefs aside, this is what the behavior of nearly everyone here today is saying they believe. "Eat drink and make Mary, for tomorrow we die!" "I'm not here for a long time, I'm here for a good time." "You only live once!" YOLO Etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> That is, the <i>Tathāgata.</i> <i>I.e.,</i> to the impersonal, the <i>khandhas.</i> In other words he views such compliments as being directed at a stage of his life and accomplishments about which he is now indifferent. Sister Upalavanna has the simplest, most direct, if not literal, translation in: "It is on account of what I have thoroughly understood, that they do it."</p>
