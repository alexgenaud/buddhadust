					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time the Lucky Man, Sāvatthi town, Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park came-a Revisiting.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There the brahman youth Todeyya's Son<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, what is the cause,<br />
					what is the reason<br />
					that humans are seen to be born in low states and high states,<br />
					of short life-span of long life,<br />
					of many illnesses of few illnesses,<br />
					ugly and beautiful,<br />
					no accounts and those of great account,<br />
					poor and wealthy,<br />
					born in low cast and of respected families,<br />
					those who are foolish and those who are wise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is the answer he received from the SammasamBuddhassa man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"<i>Kamma</i> is "one's own", brahman youth,<br />
					beings are heirs to their <i>Kamma</i>.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><i>Kamma</i> is the womb,<br />
					<i>Kamma</i> is one's ancestors,<br />
					<i>Kamma</i> is the judge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><i>Kamma</i> separates beings<br />
					into low states and high states."</p>

					<p class="f4">So then Todeyya's son said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not understand, Good Gotama, what has been said in brief here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Good Gotama were to spell out <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm"><i>Dhamma</i></a><br />
					so that I should understand the meaning in full."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Todeyya's son,<br />
					listen up,<br />
					pay attention,<br />
					I will speak:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, Todeyya's son,<br />
					some man or woman slaughters living beings,<br />
					is cruel,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					intent on injuring and killing,<br />
					without mercy to living beings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because of <i>Kamma</i> like that,<br />
					made his own<br />
					and fully developed as a <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ajiva.htm">lifestyle,</a><br />
					he, at the breaking up of the elements at death<br />
					finds consciousness again in the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/bag/advantages_disadvantages/01_advantages_toc.htm"><i>Woeful Ways</i></a><br />
					or as an Animal<br />
					or in Niriaya Hell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if he should happen to avoid that<br />
					and find consciousness again as Man,<br />
					he is of short life-span.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the way to a short life-span, Todeyya's son:<br />
					slaughtering living beings and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case of some man or woman<br />
					who has let go of slaughtering living beings,<br />
					cruelty,<br />
					bloody-handedness,<br />
					intention to injure and kill,<br />
					one who lives merciful toward all living beings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because of <i>Kamma</i> like that,<br />
					made his own<br />
					and fully developed as a lifestyle,<br />
					he, at the breaking up of the elements at death<br />
					finds consciousness again in some <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/bag/advantages_disadvantages/08_benotafraid_1.htm">Heaven World</a>.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if he should happen to fail that<br />
					and find consciousness again as Man,<br />
					he is of long life-span.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the way to a long life-span, Todeyya's son:<br />
					letting go of slaughtering living beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case<br />
					of some man or woman who is habitually harmful to living creatures<br />
					with hand or stone or stick or sword.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because of <i>Kamma</i> like that — he finds consciousness in Hell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if not, and he finds consciousness again as Man,<br />
					he has many illnesses.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the opposite case he has few illnesses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case of some man or woman who is wrathful,<br />
					grumpy,<br />
					irritable,<br />
					intolerant of small criticisms,<br />
					easily offended,<br />
					contrary,<br />
					stubborn,<br />
					angry<br />
					and shows his anger, hatred and resentment ... Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if not Hell ... he is ugly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the opposite case he is beautiful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case of some man or woman who is jealous-minded;<br />
					jealous,<br />
					revengeful,<br />
					envious,<br />
					covetous,<br />
					resentful of others gains, honor fame<br />
					and the respect paid to them. . . Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if not Hell ... he is of little account.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the opposite case he is of great account.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case of some man or woman who is stingy,<br />
					who does not give food,<br />
					clothing,<br />
					or medicine,<br />
					vehicles,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					scents,<br />
					oils<br />
					and perfumes,<br />
					bed,<br />
					lodging,<br />
					light. ... Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if not Hell ... is poor.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the opposite case he is rich.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the case of some man or woman<br />
					who is hardheaded and proud,<br />
					stuck up,<br />
					stiff,<br />
					does not acknowledge the presence of those who should be greeted,<br />
					does not stand up for one who should be stood up for,<br />
					does not give his seat<br />
					to one who deserves a seat,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					does not make way<br />
					for one who should be differed to,<br />
					does not respect,<br />
					revere,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					honor one who should receive such ... Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if not Hell ... born in a low cast of no respect.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the opposite case<br />
					he is of high birth in a respectable family.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Todeyya's son,<br />
					there is the case of some man or woman<br />
					who, having come into the presence of a sorcerer or Beggar,<br />
					does not ask:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What is skillful <i>Kamma</i>?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is unskillful <i>Kamma</i>?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is blameworthy?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What blameless?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How should one practice?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What should one not practice?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If I do what,<br />
					will it be for many a day for my pain and sorrow?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or if I do what,<br />
					will it be for many a day for my good and happiness? ... Hell</p>

					<p class="f4">But if not Hell ... he is weak in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the opposite case he is wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Todeyya's son,<br />
					the course causing short life-span<br />
					leads to shortness of life-span;<br />
					the course allowing long life-span<br />
					leads to length of life-span;<br />
					the course causing many pains<br />
					leads to having many illnesses;<br />
					the course causing few pains<br />
					leads to having few illnesses;<br />
					the course creating ugliness<br />
					leads to ugliness;<br />
					the creating the lovely<br />
					leads to beauty;<br />
					the course causing the lessening of worth<br />
					leads to smallness of account;<br />
					the course allowing greatness of account<br />
					leads to being of great account;<br />
					the course causing poverty,<br />
					leads to poverty;<br />
					the course bringing wealth<br />
					leads to being wealthy;<br />
					the course showing disrespect<br />
					leads to being low born;<br />
					the course that brings respect<br />
					leads to being high born;<br />
					the course conducive to being weak in wisdom<br />
					leads to weakness of wisdom;<br />
					the course conducive to being of great wisdom<br />
					leads to greatness in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<i>Kamma</i> is "one's own", brahman youth,<br />
					beings are heirs to their <i>Kamma</i>.<br />
					<i>Kamma</i> is the womb,<br />
					<i>Kamma</i> is one's ancestors,<br />
					<i>Kamma</i> is the judge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><i>Kamma</i> separates beings<br />
					into low states and high states."</p>

					<p class="f4">And at this Todeyya's son said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent Good Gotama! Excellent!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way as if one were to set upright<br />
					that which had been upside down;<br />
					or as if one were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that the beings there might see;<br />
					in the same way has the Good Gotama set out <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and made it clear.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I go to the Good Gotama for Refuge,<br />
					I go to the <i>Dhamma</i> for Refuge,<br />
					I go to the Order for Refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the Good Gotama accept me<br />
					as a Lay Follower going for Refuge<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					as long as life shall last!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Todeyya was King Pasenadi's spiritual advisor, a rich and grumpy fellow identified as being reborn after death as a dog in his own house by the Buddha. The story of Pasenadi, and his conversion to Buddhism, is just one of many on-going stories one encounters in reading the entire Pali.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>An elder, teacher, newcomer, or one who is infirm. In the USA, for laymen, a woman; but in the case of a Bhikkhu, women should understand that a Bhikkhu would be disrespecting the <i>Dhamma</i> to stand or give his seat to anyone not included in the first list of those to whom one should yield a seat. Women and men are considered equal in this matter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>This last, a formula, is the ending of numerous Suttas. The "Going for Refuge" is used to this day. See <a href="../../../backmatter/posters.htm#TheRefuges">The Refuges</a></p>
