					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he said to the beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Bhante!" they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lucky Man said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars, a Beggar who does not know,<br />
					trying to figure out the scope of some individual,<br />
					should examine the individual<br />
					and his rememberance<br />
					of what he has heard<br />
					about the Tathāgata<br />
					and by comparison determine<br />
					whether that individual<br />
					is a fully self-awakened one or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Two things should be examined:<br />
					things that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					and things that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should ask himself:<br />
					"Do I remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any clearly wrong thing in the Tathāgata?"</p>

					<p class="f4">He will come to the conclusion:<br />
					"I do not remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any impure thing in the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he makes comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable,<br />
					then he should ask himself:<br />
					"Do I remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any questionable thing in the Tathāgata?"</p>

					<p class="f4">He will come to the conclusion:<br />
					"I do not remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any questionable thing in the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he makes comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable,<br />
					then he should ask himself:<br />
					"Do I remember seeing any absolutely pure things<br />
					in the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">He will come to the conclusion:<br />
					"I do remember seeing and hearing absolutely pure things<br />
					in the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he makes comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable,<br />
					he should ask himself:<br />
					"Has this Venerable One<br />
					been possessed of these skills<br />
					for a long time<br />
					or is this a recent development?"</p>

					<p class="f4">If this individual<br />
					has been possessed of these skills<br />
					for a long time<br />
					and this is not a recent development,<br />
					he should ask himself:<br />
					"Do the sorts of problems<br />
					that exist only for individuals<br />
					who have attained to fame<br />
					exist for this individual or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?<br />
					Because it is only after an individual<br />
					has attained fame<br />
					that certain problems become apparent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he determines:<br />
					"This Venerable One<br />
					has been possessed of these skills<br />
					for a long time<br />
					and those problems that exist for an individual<br />
					only after he has attained fame<br />
					do not exist for him,"<br />
					he should ask himself:<br />
					"Does this individual<br />
					behave himself out of fear<br />
					or is he fearless?"</p>

					<p class="f4">If he determines:<br />
					"This individual is fearless<br />
					and abstains from indulgence in the pleasures of the senses<br />
					not from fear<br />
					but because he has ended attachment<br />
					for the pleasures of the senses."</p>

					<p class="f4">If some other Beggar comes along and says:<br />
					"How do you know this?<br />
					I mean, how do you know of some other individual<br />
					that he is fearless<br />
					and abstains from indulgence in the pleasures of the senses<br />
					not from fear<br />
					but because he has ended attachment<br />
					for the pleasures of the senses?"<br />
					then he should be able to answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is because I have seen and heard<br />
					for myself<br />
					that this individual,<br />
					whether he is in a retreat or in company,<br />
					whether his companions are making progress or not making progress,<br />
					whether they are leaders of men<br />
					or whether they are engaged in worldly pursuits<br />
					or whether they are not,<br />
					this individual treats them all alike<br />
					according to the same standard,<br />
					he does not despise anyone."</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable<br />
					to this point,<br />
					that individual should be questioned directly:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do wrong states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					exist in the Venerable One or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is an enlightened being,<br />
					he should be able to say:<br />
					"Those wrong states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					do not exist in me."</p>

					<p class="f4">If the individual is able to answer in this way,<br />
					he should be questioned further:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do questionable states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					exist in the Venerable One or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is an enlightened being,<br />
					he should be able to say:<br />
					"Those questionable states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					do not exist in me."</p>

					<p class="f4">If the individual is able to answer in this way,<br />
					he should be questioned further:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do absolutely pure states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					exist in the Venerable One or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is an enlightened being,<br />
					he should be able to say:<br />
					"Those absolutely pure states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said exist in me.<br />
					And this is my manner of living,<br />
					this is my chosen path." </p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, a Beggar should visit such an individual<br />
					so as to hear Dhamma.<br />
					Such a teacher will reveal the dark and it's results<br />
					and the light and it's results.<br />
					Such a teacher will lead one who listens<br />
					gradually higher and higher,<br />
					from the excellent to the more excellent,<br />
					point after point.<br />
					And he will lead one to fulfillment in This Dhamma.<br />
					And leading him to attaining fulfillment in This Dhamma<br />
					he will lead him to know of the Tathāgata:<br />
					"The Buddha was the #1 Highest Self Awakened One.<br />
					Well taught by the Tathāgata is Dhamma.<br />
					Those who follow,<br />
					follow the Highest Way."</p>
