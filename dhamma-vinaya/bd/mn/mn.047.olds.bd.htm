					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he said to the beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And <i>"Bhante!"</i> they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lucky Man said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars, a Beggar who does not know,<br />
					trying to figure out the scope of some individual,<br />
					should examine the individual<br />
					and his remembrance<br />
					of what he has heard<br />
					about the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					and by comparison determine<br />
					whether that individual<br />
					is a fully self-awakened one or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Two things should be examined:<br />
					things that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					and things that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should ask himself:<br />
					'Do I remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any clearly wrong thing in the <i>Tathāgata?</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">He will come to the conclusion:<br />
					'I do not remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any impure thing in the <i>Tathāgata.</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he makes comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable,<br />
					then he should ask himself:<br />
					'Do I remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any questionable thing in the <i>Tathāgata?</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">He will come to the conclusion:<br />
					'I do not remember seeing or hearing<br />
					any questionable thing in the <i>Tathāgata.</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he makes comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable,<br />
					then he should ask himself:<br />
					'Do I remember seeing any absolutely pure things<br />
					in the <i>Tathāgata.</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">He will come to the conclusion:<br />
					'I do remember seeing and hearing absolutely pure things<br />
					in the <i>Tathāgata.</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he makes comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable,<br />
					he should ask himself:<br />
					'Has this Venerable One<br />
					been possessed of these skills<br />
					for a long time<br />
					or is this a recent development?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If this individual<br />
					has been possessed of these skills<br />
					for a long time<br />
					and this is not a recent development,<br />
					he should ask himself:<br />
					'Do the sorts of problems<br />
					that exist only for individuals<br />
					who have attained to fame<br />
					exist for this individual or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?<br />
					Because it is only after an individual<br />
					has attained fame<br />
					that certain problems become apparent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he determines:<br />
					'This Venerable One<br />
					has been possessed of these skills<br />
					for a long time<br />
					and those problems that exist for an individual<br />
					only after he has attained fame<br />
					do not exist for him,'<br />
					he should ask himself:<br />
					'Does this individual<br />
					behave himself out of fear<br />
					or is he fearless?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he determines:<br />
					'This individual is fearless<br />
					and abstains from indulgence in the pleasures of the senses<br />
					not from fear<br />
					but because he has ended attachment<br />
					for the pleasures of the senses.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If some other Beggar comes along and says:<br />
					'How do you know this?<br />
					I mean, how do you know of some other individual<br />
					that he is fearless<br />
					and abstains from indulgence in the pleasures of the senses<br />
					not from fear<br />
					but because he has ended attachment<br />
					for the pleasures of the senses?'<br />
					then he should be able to answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is because I have seen and heard<br />
					for myself<br />
					that this individual,<br />
					whether he is in a retreat or in company,<br />
					whether his companions are making progress or not making progress,<br />
					whether they are leaders of men<br />
					or whether they are engaged in worldly pursuits<br />
					or whether they are not,<br />
					this individual treats them all alike<br />
					according to the same standard,<br />
					he does not despise anyone.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If the comparison is favorable<br />
					to this point,<br />
					that individual should be questioned directly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do wrong states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					exist in the Venerable One or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is an enlightened being,<br />
					he should be able to say:<br />
					'Those wrong states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					do not exist in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If the individual is able to answer in this way,<br />
					he should be questioned further:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do questionable states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					exist in the Venerable One or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is an enlightened being,<br />
					he should be able to say:<br />
					'Those questionable states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					do not exist in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If the individual is able to answer in this way,<br />
					he should be questioned further:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do absolutely pure states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said<br />
					exist in the Venerable One or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is an enlightened being,<br />
					he should be able to say:<br />
					'Those absolutely pure states that can be understood<br />
					by what is seen of what is done,<br />
					or that can be understood<br />
					by what is heard of what is said exist in me.<br />
					And this is my manner of living,<br />
					this is my chosen path.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, a Beggar should visit such an individual<br />
					so as to hear <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Such a teacher will reveal the dark and its results<br />
					and the light and its results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a teacher will lead one who listens<br />
					gradually higher and higher,<br />
					from the excellent to the more excellent,<br />
					point after point.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will lead one to fulfillment in this <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And leading him to attaining fulfillment in this <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					he will lead him to know of the <i>Tathāgata:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"The Buddha was the #1 Highest Self Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well taught by the <i>Tathāgata</i> is <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Those who follow,<br />
					follow the Highest Way."</p>
