The Buddha instructs Ānanda on the attitude which should be developed with regard to the sense organs, their objects, and the sensations and emotions arising from sense experience.

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Dark-Jungle Town, Mukhelu Grove residing.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Uttara, a brahman youth who was the student of Pārāsariya and who (putting one and one together) was most likely the person who became known later as Thera Parapara),<br />
					having approached the Lucky Man,<br />
					having greeted him respectfully and exchanged polite talk,<br />
					took a low seat to one side<br />
					and waited in eager anticipation of the afternoon's discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lucky man said this to Uttara the brahman youth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach Becoming Indra?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Good Gotama, Pārāsariya does teach Becoming Indra."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, exactly, Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach Becoming Indra?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, Good Gotama, Pārāsariya teaches<br />
					'See no material form with the eye,<br />
					hear no sound with the ear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, Uttara,<br />
					a blind man will have become Indra,<br />
					a deaf man will have become Indra,<br />
					for a blind man sees no material form with the eye,<br />
					a deaf man hears no sound with the ear."</p>

					<p class="f4">At this Uttara fell silent,<br />
					shaken,<br />
					bowled over,<br />
					downcast,<br />
					overwhelmed,<br />
					at-a-loss,<br />
					speechless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava, seeing the shaken,<br />
					bowled over,<br />
					downcast,<br />
					overwhelmed,<br />
					at-a-loss,<br />
					speechless state of Uttara,<br />
					addressed the Venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The way Pārāsariya teaches Becoming Indra<br />
					is one thing, Ānanda,<br />
					the way Becoming Indra is taught in the Discipline of the Aristocrats<br />
					is something altogether unsurpassed."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the Time, Bhagava!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the Time, Well-gone!</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Becoming Indra<br />
					in the unsurpassed way it is taught<br />
					in the Discipline of the Aristocrats is presented<br />

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay attention!</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>manāpaṃ amanāpaṃ manāpāmanāpaṃ</i> as contrasted with the more frequent <i>sukhaṃ dukkhaṃṃ asukha-ṃ-adukkhaṃ. Manāpa:</i> PED: pleasing, pleasant, charming. I would make it Mind-up. But PED says often in combination with <i>piya</i> (loved), so I think "liked" which is how Horner and others usually translate it. N/B have: "agreeable". The third alternative is forumulated in the opposite way to asukha-ṃ-adukkhaṃ (neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant) liked-not-liked.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Since we know that <u>what</u> results from the contact of eye and visible object is pleasant or unpleasant or neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant sense experience, then I think we are to understand that <i>"manapa" "amanapa"</i> and <i>"manāpāmanāpa"</i> are the categories of subjective reaction to sense experience. This is supported by the similes which indicate that the situation being discussed is not one of being free altogether from the experience, but the getting rid of any reaction to it as soon as it appears.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">So it goes like this: the eye comes into contact with a visible object, pleasant sensation arises; pleasant sensation is a thing that is liked; becoming aware of the presence of pleasant sensation, he is aware that it is something that is liked, he remembers the danger in sucha phenomena and because he is aware of the danger it is not possible for liking to develop; unliked, the original sense experiences passes away in accordance with it's dependance on the conditions which brought it into being.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Note the similies are sense-sensative.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Horner: "...he is troubled about it, ashamed of it, loathes it."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">N/B: "...he is ashamed, humiliated and disgusted..."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">N/B footnote: "Although the sekha has already entered upon the way to final deliverance, he is still prone to subtle states of liking, aversion, and dull indifference in regard to sense objects. He experiences these, however, as impediments to his progress, and thus becomes ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted by them."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This reflects the difference in interpretation between B/N and Horner and myself. The former consider that the arising of the Liked, etc. is already the state I am describing as Liking. As above, I am saying that contact of eye and visible object gives rise to sensation whether in the seeker or the arahant. The sensation is the Liked, the reaction to the sensation is Liking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">So in the case of the learner, what he is being instructed to do is to see the danger in the presence of that which is liked in it's potential for causing in him Liking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The wording in the Pali for the initial situation is the same for these two cases and the case to follow.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>] The Pali gives no indication that this section is an abbreviated version of an original in which each case was spelled out.</p>
