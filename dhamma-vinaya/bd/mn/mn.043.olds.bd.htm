					<p class="f4">First is the impression that a thing is pleasant, then one perceives certain basic properties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense experience, and perception and re-knowing-knowing-knowledge are grouped together and it is not possible to distinguish between them even upon close repeated examination. Whatever one experiences at the senses, that one perceives; whatever one perceives of that one is aware.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p10">[10]</a></span> Mental re-knowing-knowing-knowledge purified of the sense experiences at the five faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body masters <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/akasanancayatana.htm">the sphere of space</a> by thinking: "Space is limitless."

It masters <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/akincannayatana.htm">the sphere of No Thing to be Had There</a> by thinking: "There is no thing there."</p>

					<p class="f4">(Both Horner and <i>Bhks.</i> Nanamoli/Bodhi next translate <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm">"Dhamma"</a> as "thing" (Horner: knowable mental object)(N/B: a state that can be known); I believe it should be <i>Dhamma,</i> The Teaching)</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p11">[11]</a></span> One Understands <i>Dhamma</i> by way of the Eye of Wisdom (<i>pañña-cakkhu-na</i>). But one can say 'one masters things through the Eye of Wisdom'.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p12">[12]</a></span> The purpose of wisdom is for higher-mastery, all-round mastery (<i>abhi-ñ-ñatthā pari-ñ-ñatthā</i>), and for mastering ltting go (pahānatthā).</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p13">[13]</a></span> There are two grounds rebounding off which <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">High View</a> appears in individuals: The word of dome person; or mentally tracing things back to their origins (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/yoniso-manasikara.htm"><i>yoniso ca manisikaro</i></a>).</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing or 'getting' 'High View' is the key to Stream-entry. Since once one grasps 'High View' arahantship will always eventually follow, the meaning is that 'Arahantship' can be attained in these two ways, that is, either by having heard this piece of information from someone, or having discovered by one's self it through tracing things back to their points of origin. This distinguishes Buddhas and Paticca-Buddhas from Arahant followers of a Sammasambuddha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p14">[14]</a></span> If High View is put into practice and supported by <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualsila.htm#EthicalCulture">ethical conduct,</a> hearing <i>Damma,</i> discussing <i>Dhamma</i> (<i>sākacchā</i>), calm (<i>samatha</i>), and review (<i>vipassana</i>) it finds fruition in freedom of mind (<i>ceto-vimutti</i>) and its advantages and freedom of wisdom (<i>pañña-vimutti</i>) and its advantages.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the above we see where the translation of <i>pañña</i> as wisdom breaks down in that we can understand, in English, the concept of freedom of mind, but we have no point of reference for understanding what "freedom of wisdom" might be. For us, wisdom is more or less, by definition, free in that it is the idea that of choices, the wise choice will be made by one who is wise. Both Horner and N/B get around this by suggesting the idea is "freedom of mind" and "freedom by wisdom." I think the two ways of stating these two identical constructions are too far different from each other to be justified. So what is it that is intended here? I think the clue is found in the statement:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is wisdom and that which is re-knowing-knowing-knowledge are grouped together (synonyms) and it is not possible to distinguish between the two even upon close repeated examination.</p>

					<p class="f4">As stated above, the distinction is then made qualitatively: one grasps the fundamentals with re-knowing-knowing-knowledge while wisdom is to be developed over time."<br />
					So then this is how I understand the progression from mere re-knowing-knowing-knowledge to freedom of wisdom:</p>

					<p class="f4">We speak of plants as having one-sense; touch-re-knowing-knowing-knowledge;<br />
					humans and animals and other beings as having five lower senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch) and one higher sense (mind);<br />
					to this point we have "<i>viññāṇa</i>" or just re-knowing-knowing-knowledge.<br />
					With development by way of memory (experience), comes ordinary worldly wisdom (<i>pa (j)ñā;</i> past (in the sense of higher) knowing) (entry level <i>paññā</i>).<br />
					With further development, by the elimination of the contaminants of mind associated with the five lower senses we attain to pan-knowledge (<i>pan (j)ñā;</i> all encompassing knowing) equivalent to the sphere of re-knowing-knowing-knowledge; the unrestricted ability to see everything within the world from whatever viewpoint we began with ("ordinary" omniscience).<br />
					Through the introduction of the refined tools available to one with knowledge of <i>Dhamma</i> (further development by way of ethical culture, hearing <i>Dhamma,</i> discussing <i>Dhamma,</i> calm, and review focused through the lens of <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i>) we attain higher mastery and all-round mastery, or vision, or the ability to see all through the lens of <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi</i> (<i>pa aññā;</i> past (higher than ordinary) omniscience).<br />
					If we then master letting go we attain to <i>pan-aññā</i> (all encompassing omniscience), or wisdom free even of the need for the lens of <i>Sammā Diṭṭhi,</i> or, in other words: Freedom of Wisdom.)</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p15">[15]</a></span> There are three categories of living: that characterized by focus on sense pleasure <i>(kāma-lokas);</i> that characterized by degree of materiality <i>(rūpa-okas);</i> and that characterized by the absence of any materiality <i>(a-rūpa-lokas)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p16">[16]</a></span> Coming to life again for downbound blind individuals is brought about through the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm">yoke to rebirth</a> associated with delight and desire.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p19">[19]</a></span> The First Burning, therefore, is said to have five factors: The two aspects of the inner dialogue, enthusiasm, pleasure, and concentration (or, better, having become 'whole-heartedly-single-minded,' focused) (<i>citt'ekaggatā</i>).</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p20">[20]</a></span> Therefore one who has attained to the First Burning is said to have <b>let go of</b> five factors and to have five factors <b>remaining</b> (<i><i>i.e.,</i></i> is not said to have <b>gained</b> anything).</p>

					<p class="f4">The five factors he has let go are: wanting pleasure, anger, lazy ways and inertia, fear and trembling, and doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">The five factors remaining are: The two aspects of the inner dialog, enthusiasm, pleasure, and concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p21">[21]</a></span> The five lower senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching) do not interact (for example such that one could see sounds, hear smells, and so forth (sinesthesia)); but are synthesized by mental re-knowing-knowing-knowledge (such that one is able to be conscious in a way so as to say that one is able to see what one is smelling, hearing, tasting, etc).</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p22">[22]</a></span> The five lower senses rebound bound up depending on the lifespan of the individual (Downbound living rebounds bound up supported by the five lower senses)(note this is not the exact sequence as will be found in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> but is a condensation that is equally valid) (lifespan = <i>āyu;</i> PED: same root as Greek <i>"aeon",</i> "always"; Latin <i>aevum,</i> Gothic <i>aiws;</i> Old High German <i>ewa, io,</i> "always; German <i>ewig;</i> eternal; Anglo Saxon <i>ae</i> eternity, <i>a</i> always, ever, <i>aye;</i> life, vitality, duration of life, longevity.)<br />
					<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p23">[23]</a> a lifespan is supoorted by, bound up with, depends on caloric energy (<i>usmā;</i> heat &gt; <i>usuma</i> heat "who's your mama?" &gt; <i>usā</i> = food, (<i>manusa</i> = human)<br />
					Caloric energy is a result of, is supported by, is bound up with, depends on life.</p>

					<p class="f4">To assist in the understanding of this, a simile is given: In the same way as with an oil lamp, the light is seen because of the flame and the flame is seen because of the light; life depends on caloric energy and caloric energy depends on life.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The own-making of the individualized lifespan (<i>ayu-sankaram</i>) is not a thing which is generated from the senses (<i>vedaniya</i>) (<i>i.e.,</i> the lifespan does not depend on the senses interacting with their objects; the senses depend on the lifespan); if the making of one's own lifespan were a thing that was generated from the senses, then it would not be possible for a beggar who has attained the ending of perception and sense experience (<i>saññā-vedayita-nirodhaṃ</i>) to return from that state.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p24">[24]</a></span> The "death" of the body is said to have occurred when the lifespan is ended, caloric energy is gone, and re-knowing-knowing-knowledge is gone.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p25">[25]</a></span> The difference between a beggar who has attained the ending of perception and sense experience and the dead body is that in the beggar who has attained the ending of perception and sense experience activity of body, word-thought-and-speech, and mind have been brought to a halt and have disappeared, but the lifespan has not been completely ended, heat has not disappeared, and his powers (the various forces) (<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>indriyāni</i></a>) have become very clear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#p29">[29]</a></span> There are four factors connected with the freedom of mind that is neither painful nor pleasurable: Letting go of pain, letting go of pleasure, letting prior-existing mental pleasures and pains subside, and entering the Fourth Burning which is clean clear through bright shinny radiant with mental detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lust, anger and stupidity are conditions productive of boundaries, are things which are not not-things, which obstruct emptiness, and which produce signs.
