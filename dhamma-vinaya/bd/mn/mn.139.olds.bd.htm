					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					Sāvatthi-town,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br />
					Jeta Grove revisiting,<br />
					said this to the Beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!" he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Broke Tooth!" they respond.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will analyze for you the art of disengagement.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante!</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the Art of Disengagement?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p2">[2]</a></span> It is not submitting to the ploy of sweet pleasures —<br />
					stuff that has been left behind,<br />
					ordinary,<br />
					plain,<br />
					unaristocratic,<br />
					not connected to attainment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p3">[3]</a></span> It is not being employed<br />
					in exhausting the self<br />
					in painful,<br />
					unaristocratic toil<br />
					unconnected to attainment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p4">[4]</a></span> Working towards neither of these extreme ends,<br />
					the Art of Disengagement is the walking of that Middle Path<br />
					awakened to by the <i>Tathāgata,</i><br />
					made visible,<br />
					made known,<br />
					peaceful,<br />
					conducing to higher knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p5">[5]</a></span> The Art of Disengagement, beggars,<br />
					is knowing what it is to take sides<br />
					and to be biased<br />
					either for or against,<br />
					and it is the non advocacy of either side,<br />
					the not being biased<br />
					either for or against,<br />
					but simply teaching <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p6">[6]</a></span> The Art of Disengagement, beggars,<br />
					is understanding how to judge what is pleasant<br />
					and knowing how to judge what is pleasant,<br />
					being occupied solely<br />
					by inward pleasantness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p7">[7]</a></span> It is knowing about<br />
					what should be spoken of<br />
					and what should be left unsaid,<br />
					knowing the appropriate time<br />
					to speak about private matters<br />
					and when and when not to confront another<br />
					with what is unpleasant to hear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p8">[8]</a></span> It is the art of speaking clearly,<br />
					without hurry or drama,<br />
					without either denigrating the local idiom<br />
					or adhering rigidly only to<br />
					what is acceptable speech in certain circles.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="p9">[9]</a></span> This, Beggars, is The Art of Disengagement.</p>

A very efficient way to drive home a lesson.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Such as when the person themselves brings up the subject, when the person asks a direct question that elicits that information, or when one judges that the person will be receptive to discussion of the subject.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> There is of course huge controversy over the meaning of this instruction. The reason is the implications it has to translation. It is being mostly conveniently interpreted as meaning that we should use the term used locally. In other words: translate. The other understanding is that we should be teaching the local population the <i>Pāḷi</i> term. Both, of course involve translation, but with the former you end up looking to the local work for meaning, in the latter you look to the translation as a guide to what is to be found in the <i>Pāḷi.</i> It is the latter method which is being attempted on this site.</p>
