					<p class="lgqt">[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>] Horner has this footnote: MA.v.101 says that besides the sixty monks who became Arahants when the Buddha first gave this Discourse, on each occasion of its preaching by Sāriputta or Moggallāna or eighty of the great Elders a like number attained arahantship. Later, each time Maliyadeva, an Elder (see Mhvs.p.262) preached it at sixty different places in Ceylon, sixty monks attained arahantship. Once, after it had been preached by Tipitaka-Culanaga, a thousand monks did so. (MO: of course that last broke the spell.)</p>
