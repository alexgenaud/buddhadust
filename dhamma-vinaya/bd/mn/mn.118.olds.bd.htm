In the same way as I have made the point that the sutta is identical in form to the "magic spell" only that in the case of Buddhism, what we have is a "Dis-Spell", the <i>jhāna</i> is a form of trance, only in the form of a Dis-trance ... a waking up from the trance that is ordinary life-experience. In that light we can understand the series:<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>'ti'</i> 'this,' meaning 'said,' or 'he said' or 'end quote'; or as here 'saying to himself'. Thinking is always in this system 'word thought' and is considered speech of sorts even when inaudible. Here the idea I have inserted 'makes himself conscious' is not in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> but is the intention and is used because the accurate rendering would be subject to misunderstanding in our time and place (USA, Saturday, January 18, 2003 7:09 AM).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Sabba-kāya-paṭisaṃvedī.</i> Here (and the wording is the same in the <a href="../dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm"><i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> Sutta</a>) I see no justification for the interpretation by <i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi and others, relying on the commentaries (who try to force the meaning into some sort of awareness of the whole 'body of breath' or 'breathing body'), that anything other than what is being said (all-body-experiencing) is being said.<br />
					Walshe (LDB #22, pp336): 'conscious of the whole body.'<br />
					Warren: conscious of all his expirations.<br />
					<i>Bhikkhus</i> Nanamoli/Bodhi: I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body [of breath].<br />
					Horner: I will expire experiencing the whole body (with footnote: <i>i.e.</i> the breath-body).<br />
					this is, rather, making the self aware of all that which is encompassed in the idea of 'my body': the body proper, but also the experience of sense-re-knowing-knowing-knowledge (the eye and seeing) and the sensations that arise from that, but not the sense object.</p>

The meaning is co-founded (<i>saṇ</i> = with, <i>kara</i> = make)(founded by 'one' by acting on 'that'); a specialized word for <i>kamma,</i> when the meaning is to be understood as the process of personalization that takes place when an individual acts from desire to create pleasure for himself through acts of thought, word and deed. 'The' <i>saṅkhara</i> is the act itself (identifying with the act) <i>and</i> the outcome (experiencing the outcome as a personal event). Another translation could be 'conjured' 'brought up by joining with'; I have used 'own-making' in an attempt to express the main idea: the process of creating the personal world.</p>

Seat of the emotions is the way it is used in English, but it is more than just the emotions. It includes all 'mental states'. Emotions being thoughts that have become complex and have produced the strong sensations called emotions. I believe the distinction is made the same way in <i>Pāḷi</i> as it is in English. When one wishes to indicate 'pure' mental activity, one uses <i>'mano',</i> 'mind' when one wishes to indicate emotional mental states, one uses <i>'citta',</i> 'heart/center.' When one wishes to emphasize aspects and functions of the memory one uses <i>'sati',</i> recollection, paying attention, reminiscence, investigation, examination, insight, in a word: minding.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> This segment and the other three are important for understanding the way in which these different <i>'Dhammas'</i> (breathing, the four <i>satipaṭṭhanas,</i> the seven-dimensions of wisdom) are made to become one another. Breath-minding is said to be observing the body because inspiration and expiration are the activities at their most fundamental level, of the body — a fact for a long time recognized as a sign that there was life remaining in the body. Experiencing the breathing process implies examination and investigation and at a very fundamental level, at the spot where sensation first gets its footing so it is said to be investigation of sensation. The whole process being examined becomes the examination of the heart (center, mind); bringing the process to the state of detachment by letting go is done by way of <i>Dhamma</i> ... so the process begun by examining the breathing has become the mastery by way of the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>Ātāpī.</i> I yield to the conventional view here, but in my mind's eye I see the meaning as "Living in a body, seeing the body aflame" ... but, of course, that is the meaning of 'ardent.' 'Inflamed' would do if it were not so strongly associated with anger and sickness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Pari-<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimamsa.htm">vīmaṃsa.</a></i> <i>pari</i>= around; <i>vīmaṃsa</i> <i>vi</i> = re, in; <i>maṃsa</i>= member (as in the male member). I have a hard time getting passed the fact that this word means 're-member', but have yielded to the logic of this sutta here. Most of the other translators also have 'investigation' which certainly makes life easier. This translation fits in well here, but does not go well when the term appears as one of the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#VIMAMSA">iddhi-pada</a> where I am convinced that what is involved is memory, not investigation.<br />
					and see also discussion: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/remembering_sati.htm">remembering sati</a> I think what is really going on here is that investigation is actually an act of re-memberance: the piecing together of this memory and that to form an idea of a thing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> From a discussion of <i>jhāna:</i> Although the entrance to the second burning is marked by the ending of thinking, the <i>cause</i> is the appreciation of the state of <i>jhāna</i> itself "I <i>like</i> doing this!". The second <i>jhāna</i> is said to be "Born of serenity". I call this turning the mind on itself. This turning the mind on itself is one step removed from the identification with thought I just described; the second level of detachment. This produces a "characteristic" or "sign": that of "enthusiasm".<br />
					There is difference of opinion, exactly concerning the meaning of this term: <i>'pīti'.</i> I call it enthusiasm; it is probably most accurately called "excitement" as in ordinary use this word has both a carnal and an un-carnal meaning. Some have called it "rapture" (<i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro), but this term carries European and Christian implications too exclusively religious in nature, and I don't see an ordinary state of rapture ... well, maybe at Raves. You might call it a "rush". The term is really one that encompasses a spectrum of emotional states from mild appreciation through excitement, enthusiasm, appreciation, love and rapture and the word we use for translation should imply or at least allow for this spectrum.</p>
