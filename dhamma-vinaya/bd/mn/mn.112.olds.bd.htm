					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>The questions to be asked when in doubt about some person's claim to be Arahant. I believe this is the first full translation of this sutta. The PTS and <i>Bhks.</i> Nanamoli and Bodhi's translations have abbreviations and both re-use previous translations of the last section whereas it contains differences from the previously translated <i>Pāḷi.</i> Sister Upalavana's translation is linked. She often mangles English, but her predisposition is to accurate translation independent of the other translators and consulting her choices is sometimes helpful.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, then, with calm heart, pure, clean, debtless, without afflictions, become soft, capable, steadfast, unshakable,<br />
					the heart bent down to knowledge of the eradication of the corruptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the knowledge: "This is pain" emerged as though a splendid light from a dark cloud,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the knowledge: "This is corruption" emerged as though a splendid light from a dark cloud,<br />
					the knowledge: "This is the source of corruption" emerged as though a splendid light from a dark cloud,<br />
					the knowledge: "This is the end to corruption" emerged as though a splendid light from a dark cloud,<br />
					the knowledge: "This is the way to walk to the end of corruption" emerged as though a splendid light from a dark cloud.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I knew thus, saw thus, I was freed in heart from the corruption of sense pleasures,<br />
					freed in heart from the corruption of living,<br />
					freed in heart from the corruption of blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am free" and had the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth: left behind,<br />
					carrying on as Brahma: finished,<br />
					duty's doing: done,<br />
					no further it'n-n-at'n is to be known for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, my friends,<br />
					thus knowing, seeing,<br />
					with regard to this body with re-knowing-knowing-knowledge<br />
					and all external signs,<br />
					I say that "Bias towards me- my-making is uprooted."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such being so, beggars, express delight, speak out with a 'Well said', for this beggar's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having expressed delight, having spoken out with a 'Well said', for this beggar's words, say:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There is a mystery in connection with this sutta. There are only five questions put to the <i>bhikkhu.</i> From what, then, does the title derive? I am thinking: "Hum. This is a nice neat way to fake everyone out claiming I am <i>arahat.</i> I just memorize the responses here. Get them down good so it seems reasonable I actually understand what I am saying." I am thinking: "How do we prevent the faker from just coming along and memorizing the responses here ... etc?" I am thinking I see how to do that. There is something the Arahant should know that I will ask him that I will not put into this sutta." What thing? The meaning of the title of this sutta. (Just a joke. Mostly the suttas did not originally have titles.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Añña.</i> Answer Knowledge. However translated it means a declaration of Arahantship. It is the ability to know whatever one wants to know whenever one wants to know it. It differs from omniscience as we understand it in the sense that there is no claim to know everything at all times.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Itthatta</i> being any sort of 'it' in any place of 'atness'.<br />
					<span class="f2">PED: being here (in this world), in the present state of becoming, this (earthly) state (not "thusness" or "life as we conceive it", as Mrs. Rh.D. in K.S. I.177 ...</span><br />
					Well that is what PED says, but the <i>Dhamma</i> is not for this world only.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Is this an admonition to speak the truth? Remember it is Gotama that is speaking, here in the voice of questioning <i>bhikkhus,</i> next in the voice of the responder. If the question is an admonition as well as a question, the response is a generic way of responding to the admonition with knowing humor.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Saṃyojana.</i> See: Glossology: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i><b>Saṃyojana.</b></i></a> (1) <i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi,</i> one-truth view, own-self view; (2) <i>vicikicchā,</i> doubt; (3) <i>sīlabbata-parāmāso,</i> belief in the efficacy of ethics for the destruction of pain; (4) <i>kāma-c-chando,</i> pleasure-wishing; (5) <i>vyāpādo,</i> deviance, anger; (6) <i>rūpa-rāgo,</i> desire for things with form; (7) <i>a-rūpa-rāgo,</i> desire for immaterial things; (8) <i>māno,</i> pride; (9) <i>uddhaccaṃ,</i> fear; (10) <i>avijjā,</i> blindness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup><i>Upādāna-k-khandhā. upa</i> = up; <i>dana</i> = given, bound; <i>k-kha</i> = a heap of.<br />
					<i>'Khandha'</i> is one of several classifications intended to encompass all that comprises what has come into existence. The implication here by the use of the term <i>'upadana'</i> is that they are what is stocked up, piled up, kept up, heaped up ... or as <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro, used for fueling ... the individuality ... this is the term between thirst and living in the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> that implies taking some action motivated by thirst to obtain the experience of living, hence 'grasping' used by Ms. Horner and some other translators.<br />
					<span class="f2">PED: <i>Khandha</i> [Sanskrit <i>skandha</i>] - I. Crude meaning: bulk, massiveness (gross) substance. A. esp. used (a) of an elephant: the bulk of the body, <i>i.e.</i> its back ... (b) of a person: the shoulder or back ... (c) of a tree: the trunk ... <i>mūlaṃ atikkamma kh- ṃ sāraṃ pariyesitabbaṃ </i>"one must go beyond the root and search the trunk for sweetness" S IV.94. - (d) as t.t. in exegetical literature: section, chapter, lit. material as collected into uniform bulk; frequent in postscripts to Texts and Commentaries. ... B. More general as denoting bulk (*-); e.g. <i>aggi-</i> a great mass of fire ... II. Applied meaning. -A. (*-) the body of, a collection of, mass, or parts of; in collective sense "all that is comprised under"; forming the substance of. ... (a) <i>dukkha-</i> all that is comprised under <i>"dukkha,"</i> all that goes to make up or forms the substance, the idea of "ill." Most prominent in phrase <i>kevalassa dukkha-khandhassa samudaya</i> and <i>nirodha</i> (the origin and destruction of all that is suffering) with reference to the <i>paṭicca samuppāda,</i> the chain of causal existence ...</span></p>

					<p>EDIT: Saturday, January 14, 2017 3:31 AM: With time, a clearer understanding: <i>Upadana</i> is the thinking, pondering, planning, scheming that goes on in one desirous of obtaining some sort of pleasure in some form of existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i><b>Saṅkhāra.</b></i> The identification with an act of body, speech or mind intended to create identified-with experience of existence and the subsequent identified-with experience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i><b>Dhātu</b></i> Data. The basic information we are given about the world. What we can know through identification of characteristics. 'Element', used by almost all the other translators, has the disadvantage of pointing to an actual thing when what this means is something that can be known about a thing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i><b>Ajjhattikāni bāhirāni.</b></i> Internal external. Subjective objective. Personal external. Relating to the individual and external to the individual. What should be avoided here is thinking in terms of self. Not: mine and external, or 'belonging to the self' and external.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> There is a difficulty here for sticklers for detail. This is Gotama speaking in the voice of the beggar supposedly speaking of himself, but he speaks about a large or small pile of wealth and a large or small circle of friends as though he did not know. I have made this into an 'aside' from Gotama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> I moved the position of this one. The groups here and also in the <i>Dīgha</i> seem to be a gathering-together from other places in the suttas. The usual progression in the Gradual Training is: Giving, Ethical Culture, Self-control, Mental development. Here they are a little mixed up.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This could be another case of the character being portrayed by Gotama here voicing the usual alternatives rather than the one he himself chose. However Gotama, as reported in the Suttas, at various times used all of these.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i><b>Vitakka</b></i> and <b><i>vicāra.</i></b> A lot of back and forth about these terms which are both essentially simply 'thinking'. Early use pointed to no distinction. The commentaries would have these as two advanced states with the first being the beginning of a higher level of thinking and the second being thinking that had momentum of its own. Since these states are present in the first burning and no mention is made of the need for them to be acquired, it seems necessary to think that they are present in the ordinary mind. Especially as these terms are used for 'thinking' in non-<i>jhāna</i> states. The interesting thing is the use of <i>'vi'</i> or 're' in both terms, indicating what a close look will tell one, that is, that these things are re-hashings. The first 're' is 're-talking', the second one is 're-wandering around', 're-meandering'. What these are, skipping over precise terms, becomes clear when attempting the entry into the second burning where they are to be eliminated. At this point perhaps a better term is Don Juan's 'inner dialogue'.</p>
