					<p class="lgqt">Note: This is not a translation that adheres closely to the original Pali. I have told the story according to how I hear it and think it would be best told today. This is not a sutta that depends heavily on technical knowledge of the Dhamma. It pounds home one idea that is not too difficult to grasp: the danger in Fame, Favors and Gains. In the case of these three key concepts, I believe the terms are translated here more closely to the Pali than are the terms used by the other translators. I happen to like this sutta as it demonstrates the point I am making about the suttas being "spells". Had the point of this sutta simply been to describe the mechanics of the dangers of gains, it could have been done in one paragraph and perhaps a simile. Instead this goes on for 10 pages in the highly abbreviated Pali, and was delivered over a period of several days. Whatever the reader's understanding of what a "spell" is supposed to be like, this sutta is an example of a spell. The importance of this sutta first came to my attention in New York City round about 1980 when one of my friends began to attain some fame; I wrote out this sutta for him in bold black ink on paper with the edges singed off all round. Hopefully it has served it's purpose in keeping him somewhat level-headed in his career.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once Upon A Time, a Long Long Time Ago, Beggars, a great family of turtles, used to live in a Certain Deep Pool. And there, the number one turtle says to another turtle: "Friend Turtle, such and such a place here should never be visited." But that turtle went to that place anyway, and there was pierced by The Hunter's harpoon. Then that turtle tried to return to the family and the number one turtle saw him coming from way off and said: "Hello there, friend turtle, long-time-no-see, I hope you have not been visiting that place that should never be visited?" "Well, yes, sir, I have visited that place," he said in reply. "Well then, friend turtle, I hope you were not pierced by The Hunter's harpoon?" And the turtle responded: "Na, I wasn't pierced, but there is this Twine<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> that keeps trailing behind me." "Then for sure you have been pierced, friend turtle. Know that for sure you have been pierced in just such a way as your father and grandfather before you were pierced and were waylaid and came upon hard luck because of this Twine. It is time, now, for you to depart, friend turtle, for you now belong to someone else."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Harpoon, Beggars, is another word for Fame, Favors and Gains.</p>

When he returns to the residence he boasts and brags to the other Beggars there saying: "I have just returned from a fine meal where I ate my fill, was given a bowl full to take with me and was invited back for tomorrow." And he looks down on the other Beggars, thinking "It is I, and not these Beggars, that Gains Food, Clothing, Medicine and Shelter, of such Mighty Power and Majesty is my Good Kamma."
