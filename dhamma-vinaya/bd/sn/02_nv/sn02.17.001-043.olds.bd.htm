					<h1><a id="ffg">Fame, Favors and Gains</a></h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the <i>Pāḷi</i><br />
               by<br />
               Michael M. Olds</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Note: This is not a translation that adheres closely to the original <i>Pāḷi.</i> I have told the story according to how I hear it and think it would be best told today. This is not a sutta that depends heavily on technical knowledge of the <i>Dhamma.</i> It pounds home one idea that is not too difficult to grasp: the danger in Fame, Favors and Gains.</p>

					<p>In the case of these three key concepts, I believe the terms are translated here more closely to the <i>Pāḷi</i> than are the terms used by the other translators.</p>

					<p>I happen to like this sutta as it demonstrates the point I am making about the suttas being "spells". Had the point of this sutta simply been to describe the mechanics of the dangers of gains, it could have been done in one paragraph and perhaps a simile. Instead this goes on for 10 pages in the highly abbreviated <i>Pāḷi,</i> and was delivered over the course of many days.</p>

					<p>Whatever the reader's understanding of what a "spell" is supposed to be like, this sutta is an example of a spell. The importance of this sutta first came to my attention in New York City round about 1980 when one of my friends began to attain some fame; I wrote out this sutta for him in bold black ink on paper with the edges singed off all round. Hopefully it served its purpose in keeping him somewhat level-headed in his career.</p>
