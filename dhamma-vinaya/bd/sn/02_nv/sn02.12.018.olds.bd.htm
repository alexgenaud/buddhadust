					<p class="f4">Then Timbaruka the wanderer,<br />

					<p class="f4">"How is it good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made<br />
					by one's self?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Timbaruka"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then one more, good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made<br />
					by another?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Timbaruka"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then one more, good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made<br />
					by one's self, and<br />
					another?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Timbaruka"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then one more, good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made by<br />
					neither one's self, nor<br />
					another — <br />
					but has arisen as self spontaneously?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Timbaruka"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, good Gotama —<br />
					is there no such thing as pain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Timbaruka,<br />
					it is not that<br />
					there is no such thing as pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is pain, Timbaruka."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it then put forward, Gotama,<br />
					that he does not know<br />
					does not see<br />
					pain?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No, Timbaruka, I am not one<br />
					who does not know<br />
					does not see<br />

					<p class="f4">I am one who knows pain, Timbaruka,<br />
					I am one who sees pain Timbaruka."</p>

					<p class="f4">Teach me, <i>Bhante,</i><br />

					<p class="f4">"'He who acts<br />
					is he who experiences the result',<br />
					or Timbaruka,<br />
					remembering one's heedlessness<br />
					'is pain made by one's self' —<br />
					this comes down to professing the eternalist side."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'One acts<br />
					another is he who experiences the result',<br />

					<p class="f4">Avoiding both sides, Timbaruka,<br /> 
					the Tathāgata teaches you<br />
					a middle <i>Dhamma</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebounding off blindness, beggars,<br />
					own-making<br />
					rebounding off own-making,<br />
					consciousness<br />
					rebounding off consciousness,<br />
					named-form<br />
					rebounding off named-form,<br />
					the six-realms<br />
					rebounding off the six-realms,<br />
					touch<br />
					rebounding off touch,<br />
					sensation<br />
					rebounding off sensation,<br />
					thirst<br />
					rebounding off thirst,<br />
					bind-ups<br />
					rebounding off bind-ups,<br />
					existence<br />
					rebounding off existence,<br />
					birth<br />
					rebounding off birth,<br />
					aging and death<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery<br />
					and despair<br />
					become one's own.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even thus<br />
					is the self-arising<br />
					of this pile of pain<br />
					made to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you<br />
					utterly-dispassionately-end blindness,<br />
					own-making is ended<br />
					own-making ended,<br />
					consciousness is ended<br />
					consciousness ended,<br />
					named-form is ended<br />
					named-form ended,<br />
					the six-realms are ended<br />
					the six-realms ended,<br />
					touch is ended<br />
					touch ended,<br />
					sensation is ended<br />
					sensation ended,<br />
					thirst is ended<br />
					thirst ended,<br />
					bind-ups are ended<br />
					bind-ups ended,<br />
					existence is ended<br />
					existence ended,<br />
					birth is ended<br />
					birth ended,<br />
					aging and death<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery<br />
					and despair<br />
					are ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so<br />
					is this pile of pain<br />
					made to not be."</p>					

					<p class="f4">This said, Timbaruka the unclothed
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as though, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					one were to set upright the upside-down,<br />
					or uncover the covered,<br />
					or to show the way to one who was lost,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that creatures there might see:<br />
					'There are Forms!'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, The Lucky Man<br /> 
					has in many a figure<br />
					presented his <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I take myself to The Lucky Man for refuge,<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Dhamma</i> for refuge;<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Saṅgha</i> for refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the Venerable Gotama remember me<br />
					as a lay disciple<br />
					who from this day<br />
					and for as long as life lasts<br />
					has taken refuge.</p>
