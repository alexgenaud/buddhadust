					<p class="f4">My <i>Dhamma</i>, beggars,<br />
					being thus<br />
					well shown,<br />
					laid out,<br />
					opened up,<br />
					explained,<br />
					tailored to fit,<br />
					it is enough<br />
					for the son of a good family<br />
					gone forth out of faith<br />
					to exert energy<br />
					vowing:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'With pleasure but that<br />
					skin, and<br />
					sinews, and<br />
					bones<br />
					be left<br />
					the flesh and blood<br />

					dry up<br />
					before the energy is gone<br />
					which a man<br />
					through development of this emaciated body,<br />
					can by the vitality of man<br />
					by what can be done by a man<br />
					win what can be won.<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed painful, beggars,<br />
					is the life of the lazy<br />
					full of bad unskillful things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And great<br />
					the good<br />
					that is lost.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pleasant, beggars,<br />
					is the life of the energetic<br />
					separated from bad unskillful things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And great<br />
					the good<br />
					that is gained.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not, beggars, by the low<br />
					is the winning of the high to be had,<br />
					by the high<br />
					is the winning of the high to be had.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To be drunk like cream, beggars,<br />
					is the best of lives.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Master has come to you<br />
					face to face,<br />
					therefore, beggars,<br />
					set going energy<br />
					to attain the unattained,<br />
					to get what has not been got,<br />
					to realize the as yet unrealized,<br />
					thinking:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Thus will our going forth<br />
					not be barren<br />
					but yield bountifully,<br />
					our essentials of<br />	
					robes,<br />
					alms bowl,<br />
					lodging, and<br />
					medicine for use during sickness<br />
					becoming of great fruit<br />
					of great advantage.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even so, beggars,<br />
					should you train yourselves.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, beggars,<br />
					considering one's own position<br />
					it is enough to not be careless<br />
					in striving.</p>
