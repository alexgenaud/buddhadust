<meta name="description" content="Samyutta Nikaya, 2.12, Nidana Vagga, Sutta 16. The Buddha describes how if one teaches even only one link in the Paticca Samuppada one may be called a Dhamma Teacher; if one practices only one link one may be called one who lives the Dhamma of the Dhamma; if one experiences freedom as a consequence of the experience of only one link one may be said to have won Nibbāna in this life. He repeats this three-fold formula for each of the links." />
