					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, the Lucky Man,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					Bamboo Grove,<br />
					the squirrels' feeding place<br />
					came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was at a time<br />
					when a certain beggar named Elder<br />
					had been living alone<br />
					and was speaking in praise of living alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Alone he entered the village for handouts,<br />
					alone he returned,<br />
					alone he sat in solitude,<br />
					alone he paced the place to pace.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then a number of beggars<br />
					approached The Lucky Man<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near the Lucky Man<br />
					and exchanged greetings and salutations,<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					they said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, <i>Bhante,</i> a certain beggar named Elder<br />
					lives alone<br />
					and speaks in praise of living alone."</p>

					<p class="f4">At that the Lucky Man addressed a certain beggar:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, beggar,<br />
					in my words invite <i>bhikkhu</i> Elder saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master invites you, friend Elder.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, <i>Bhante!"</i><br />
					this beggar responded to the Lucky Man<br />
					and then he approached the Ancient <i>bhikkhu</i> Elder<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near<br />
					he addressed the Ancient Elder saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Master invites you, friend Elder."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friend"<br />
					responded the Ancient Elder<br />
					who then approached the Lucky Man<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near<br />
					and exchanged greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was seated to one side then,<br />
					the Lucky Man said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true Elder,<br />
					that you live alone<br />
					and speak in praise of living alone?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in detail, Elder,<br />
					what is the manner of your<br />
					living alone<br />
					and speaking in praise of living alone?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					alone I enter the village for handouts,<br />
					alone I return,<br />
					alone I sit in solitude,<br />
					alone I pace the place to pace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, <i>Bhante,</i> do I<br />
					live alone<br />
					and speak in praise of living alone."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, Elder, is living alone,<br />
					I do not say it is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there is, Elder,<br />
					a more satisfactory development<br />
					of living alone to be had.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear!</p>

					<p class="f4">Give your mind over to studious attention!</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the ancient Elder responding:<br />
					"Even so, <i>Bhante!"</i><br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, Elder,<br />
					is this more satisfactory development<br />
					of living alone to be had?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here Elder,<br />
					whatsoever is of the past,<br />
					that is let go,<br />
					whatsoever is of the future,<br />
					that is abandoned,<br />
					and as to appearance in the present<br />
					of that which one has coming to the self,<br />
					wanting and lust is well removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Elder,<br />
					is this more satisfactory development<br />
					of living alone which may be had."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Lucky Man said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">The Well-gone having said this,<br />
					the Master added:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Above it all, all knowing, wise<br />
					      By all things unpolluted,<br />
					      All rejecting, thirst destroyed, free —<br />
					      Of such a hero I speak of as 'living alone'."</p>
