The idea is that upon experience of a sensation and the arising of desire to re-experience that sensation, or to et way from it if it is painful, these things provide excuses or reasons or bases ... supports ... plans ... intentions ... fuel ... for rationalizing the taking up of a new existence. They uphold existence. 'Support ending, existence ends' is what is indicated when through taking up a device like investigation of the foulness of the body, or finding no basis for ambition in any aspect of the world, one finds existence repulsive and finding it repulsive one lets it go. Existence no longer has the illusion of pleasure or beauty or reasons for ambition as support and without that support there is no taking the action that is required to enter existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Taṇhā.</i> Thirst, hunger, desire to experience through the senses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Dhamma-taṇhā.</i> Lower-case 'd'. Things. In this case mental objects. But 'things' rather than 'The <i>Dhamma</i>' or just 'Ideas' because the objects of the mind where, as here, limited to mind as it relates to existence, are the forms of consciousness arising from the contact of the other senses with their objects as well as thoughts, ideas, consciousness itself, and consciousness of the formless spheres.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Nāma-rūpa.</i> Name-form or shape. Phe-nomena. A close approximation of what we understand to be perception. The identification of a 'thing' by its 'name'. The two are co-terminus, cannot exist one without the other. All existing things consist of name/form + consciousness and the combined three are called 'contact'. In the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15"><i>Māha Nidana Suttaṃ</i></a> the Buddha describes how it is contact of consciousness with named form that constitutes existence. It is the separation of consciousness from named-form-consciousness (or consciousness through the senses) that stops the progression of the chain of interdependent factors bringing pain to an end, that is, <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Saṅkhāra.</i> Identification with the intent to create personal experience through acts of body, speech and mind and the identified-with result. A near synonym of <i>kamma,</i> but with emphasis on the process of personalization. Mrs. Rhys Davids 'activities' conveys only half the meaning; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'volitional formations' conveys only the other half. Volitional activities and their resultant identified-with formations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Dhamma-sota.</i> I say '<i>Dhamma</i>-ear'. PED and most translators say "<i>Dhamma</i>-stream" or "Stream of the". <i>Sotāpatti</i> is almost always translated 'Streamwinner', including by me, but I believe the earlier version was '<i>Dhamma</i>-ear' and 'stream' was used primarily to symbolize the pull <i>(āpo)</i> of worldly life.</p>
