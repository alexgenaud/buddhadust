<meta name="description" content="Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Ahara Vagga), Sutta 12. After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food. Gotama responds correcting his thinking from 'who feeds?' to 'what results from feeding on?', which leads into the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada)." />

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding "Bhante!",<br />

					<p class="f4">Four, me Beggars, are the foods<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Kabalinkāro āhāro</i> Usually found translated as "material"; <i>kabala:</i> stuff-offerable, <i>kāro:</i> made. Made-edible generally because it has had the life taken out of it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>oḷāriko vā sukhumo vā.</i> Substantial or subtle because this must fit the edible food requirements of all sorts of living things, from humans who eat gross material foods, to plants which eat fine material foods, to the gods that are sustained on such things as aromas or thoughts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>mano-sañcetanā.</i> Mind one with heart. Thought in alignment with the will to do. Having the heart for what is in mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Āyatiɱ &gt; ayatana</i> in meaning 2: exertion, doing, working, practice, performance. Neither Rhys Davids' 'cause' nor Bhk. Bodhi's 'condition'. Rhys Davids and Bhk. Bodhi focus on the switch from 'who' to 'what', but the Buddha's objection is not to the 'who' — the Buddha objects to the ideas 'feeds on', 'touches', 'intends' and 'cognizes' as implying the nourishment of a being that is feeding, where what is intended is that these foods <i>further</i> or bring about <i>further</i> existence. The first case implies, by pointing backward in Time, to a constant existing being.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Upādiyatī.</i> Fueling, planning-to-get. Fueling the fire. This stands in for <i>mano-sañcetanā.</i> The fuel for existence (or freedom from existence) is the contimplation of and wishing for and intending to get such. The consciousness food is implied by the resulting state: either as consciousness of being an existing being or as consciousness of freedom from existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>phass'āyatanānaɱ</i> Spheres of contact. Not 'the six bases for contact' [Bhk. Bodhi] or 'the sixfold sphere of sense-contact' [Mrs. Rhys Davids] or 'the six sense media' [Bhk. Thanissaro], it is the equivalant of all these.</p>
