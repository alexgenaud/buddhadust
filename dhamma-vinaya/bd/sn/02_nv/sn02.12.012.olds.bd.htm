<meta name="description" content="Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Ahara Vagga), Sutta 12. After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food. Gotama responds correcting his thinking from 'who feeds?' to 'what results from feeding on?', which leads into the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada)." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Āyatiṃ &gt; ayatana</i> in meaning 2: exertion, doing, working, practice, performance. Neither Rhys Davids' 'cause' nor <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'condition'. Rhys Davids and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi focus on the switch from 'who' to 'what', but the Buddha's objection is not so much to the 'who' — the Buddha objects to the ideas 'feeds on', 'touches', 'intends' and 'cognizes' as implying the nourishment of a being that is feeding, where what is intended is that these foods <i>further</i> or bring about <i>further</i> existence. The first case implies, by pointing backward in Time, to a constant existing being.</p>

This stands in for <i>mano-sañcetanā.</i> The fuel for existence (or freedom from existence) is the contemplation of and wishing for and intending to get such. The consciousness food is implied by the resulting state: either as consciousness of being an existing being or as consciousness of freedom from existence.</p>
