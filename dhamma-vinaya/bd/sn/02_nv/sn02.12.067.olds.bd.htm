					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Sayaɱkataɱ.</i> Of one's own making. The question implies the idea of a continuing self by pointing to the consequences of a deed done at one point in Time being experienced at another point in Time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Parakataɱ.</i> Beyond-making. Done by one, experienced by another. The question implies the idea that there their arises and falls at each successive moment a self. This is the perception in back of the idea that there is no self, or annihilationism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The idea that the self both is and is not.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The idea that the self neither is nor is not and that experience occurs without dependence on the actions of an individual.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Paccayā.</i> Supports. See <a href="#n14">n. 14</a> below. Previous translations have been: repercusses (mine), results in (mine), conditions, causes. From <i>paṭi+i,</i> 're-,' 'reflect,' 'return,' to bounce off of; PED "resting on, falling back on, foundation; cause, motive etc. The PED 'cause' no doubt arising as self-defining loop from Rhys Davids translations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Bhava.</i> In this position in the <i>Paṭicca Samuppada, bhava</i> is the possibility of being a living being in some world of living beings. See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.15.olds.bd.htm#p4">DN 15.</a> where the following is linked to other translations and the Pali:<br />
					"If, Ānanda, there were no existence at all of any sort, by any being of any sort, whatever, however; that is: sensate existence, existence in forms, existence without form — with the non-existence of all existence, with the eradication of existence, could there then be any discerning of birth?" 'becoming' in this position is misleading in that it does not underscore the idea that what Gotama is talking about is the whole idea of existence, not just existence in existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Upādāna.</i> Up-given/bound. Fuel, Support, involvement, being given-over-to, commitment, attachment, yielding to. It is the point just before taking action when the will to resist has been overcome. Yielding is slightly better than the more literal 'giving-up' here in that it carries better the idea that one is going with or allowing one's self to be carried on by the thirst.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Taṇhā.</i> Hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Vedanā.</i> Experience. The sensation experienced through the the realm of the sensess of pleasure or the sensation experienced through the the realm of the sensess of pain or experience that is not unpleasant, but not pleasant. In the case of the first case it is blindnes to the fact that pleasant sensation experienced through the the realm of the sensess is only temporary and results in pain when it comes to an end that results in yielding to the temptation to exist. In the case of painful sensation experienced through the the realm of the sensess it is blindness to the fact that pain too is temporary and that to struggle to escape pain through existence is not the way to bring pain to an end. In the case of the third case it is blindness to the fact that experience that is not unpleasant and not pleasant is the experience associated with Nibbāna and is freedom from the realm of the senses-experience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Phassa.</i> Touch, contact.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Saḷāyatana.</i> Six Realms. The realms of the the realm of the sensess. The eye and sights; the ear and sounds; the nose and scents; the tongue and tastes; the body and touches; the mind and things, phenomena, dhammas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Nāma-rūpa.</i> Named-shapes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Viññāṇa.</i> Consciousness. Re-knowing-knowing. Awareness of being conscious.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> It is important to understand that this is not a simile about the coming into existence of the sheaves of reeds. In the simile the sheaves of reeds already exist. The simile is about the ability of the two sheaves of reeds to stand upright only insofar as they are supported by one another. We are here given insight into the meaning of the term <i>'paccaya',</i> that is, that it means to lean on, support, or to be depended on. (Also, Bhk. Thanissaro's 'requisite condition') Here: 'supported by birth is aging and death' or 'depending on birth is againg and death'. This pretty much fundamentally changes all previous translations of the <i>Paticca Samuppada</i> that ... support the idea of creation or cause.</p>
