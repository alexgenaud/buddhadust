					<p class="f4"><b>Introduction</b></p>
					
					<p class="f4">The formula described in these suttas has nothing to do with 'causation'. Blindness does not cause own-making nor does own-making cause consciousness. Own-making is only one of any number of things that might result from blindness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To understand the point, you need to start at the other end: "How does one get rid of grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is accomplished by no longer identifying with the individuality that is the result of blindness as to where it always ends.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the story of how that identification occurs and how it can be made not to recur. That it can be brought to an end is the position taken by the Buddha that is being explained in the yarns of this chapter of the <i>Saṃutta Nikāya.</i> I believe the suttas of this chapter should be read together.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To hold that the Bodhi Mind exists, is the same thing as holding that the mind exists, the self exists, or that the Tathāgata exists after death — it is the eternalist view. To hold that the Bodhi Mind, etc. does not exist is the annihilationist view. Avoiding both views, by not taking even one step in either of those two directions, a third way is to be seen: A Way Down The Middle. To hold that The Way Down the Middle means moderation is to miss the point. That is the second thing that is made clear in this group of suttas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I believe the suttas of this chapter should be read together, and that is what you have here. And don't skip over the repetitions: this is a lesson that needs to be drummed in; if you cannot bear to read a repetition, stop and give it a rest and come back to it later. I have repeated some footnotes in compiling this group for the same reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kassapa the unclothed received the going forth<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after his ordination,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus it is that there is here<br />

					<p class="f4">This being so, beggars,<br />
					what is the distinction,<br />

				   the foolish — the wise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, <i>Bhante,</i><br />

The idea is rebounding, percussing, bouncing off. If tied to this, that rebounds off it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.2" href="#fn1.2">1.2</a>]</sup></span> <i>Samuppāda. Sam + uppāda.</i> Self arising. Taken as having the double meaning of "arising by itself" and "arising as the self".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.3" href="#fn1.3">1.3</a>]</sup></span> PED: The <i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i> is also called the <i>Nidāna paccayākāra. Nidāna Paccaya Saṇkhāra</i> Tied down Rebounding Own-making. PED: The oldest account is found in the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14"><i>Mahāpadāna Suttanta</i></a> of the <b><i>Dīgha Nikāya.</i></b> (Also see: <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">Mahā-Nidāna Suttanta</a>)<br />
					<i>Nidāna</i> PED: (neuter) [Sanskrit <i>nidāna, ni + dāna Ni</i> = down; <i>dāna</i> = bound. The name given to the first knot in the weaving of a rug. PED: <i>dā, dyati</i> to bind, <i>cf.</i> Greek δέσμα, δῆμα (fetter) ... (a) (noun) tying down to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.4" href="#fn1.4">1.4</a>]</sup></span> <i>Saṇkhāra. San</i> = 0wn, or 
					self; <i>khāra</i> = make. Identification with the intent to create personal experience by way of thoughts, words, or deeds, and the identification with the resultant thing made. The difference between this and <i>kamma</i> is in the intent to create experience for the self. The whole point of this formula is the explanation of how the identification of self comes to be attached to sense experience. It happens because that thing there that is currently identified with as self intends to extend that life through its actions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.5" href="#fn1.5">1.5</a>]</sup></span> <i>Viññāṇa.</i> Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge. The knowledge of knowing the known. Awareness of knowing. Kenning: knowing. Called consciousness here because that is how it is generally known. In this case its intended meaning is "sense-consciousness".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.6" href="#fn1.6">1.6</a>]</sup></span> <i>Nāma-rūpa. Nāma</i> = name; <i>rūpa</i> = form. All existing things, (existing in what the 
					Buddha taught meaning perceived through the senses) including things with no apparent shape such as wave-forms, sounds, and beings that do not have visible bodies, are characterized as having substance and are named.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.7" href="#fn1.7">1.7</a>]</sup></span> <i>Saḷāyatana. Sala</i> = six; <i>ayatana</i> = realms. The realm of the senses: eye and visible objects; ear and sounds; nose and scents; tongue and tastes; body and touches; mind and mental objects (mental objects being the sense-conscousneses of the other senses plus memory). All six together also known as "The All" meaning that this group encompasses everything that has come into existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.8" href="#fn1.8">1.8</a>]</sup></span> <i>Phassa.</i> Touch, meaning contact.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.9" href="#fn1.9">1.9</a>]</sup></span> <i>Vedanā.</i> Experience. To be understood 3 different ways: as the <b>experience</b> of the Arahant, as the <b>sense-experience</b> of the ordinary being, and as here, the <b>sensation</b> arising from consciousness of contact of sense-organ with sense-object. Sensation is experienced in three ways: as pleasant, as unpleasant, and as neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Sensation that  is experienced as neither unpleasant nor pleasant is experienced in 2 ways: by the ignorant, world-bound individual as being a lack of stimulation and therefore to be replaced as soon as possible with some pleasaant stimulation; and by the one on the path to the end of pain as a taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i> In neither case of the sensation that is neither unpleasant nor unpleasant is it a feeling, that is, 'neutral' sensation. "Sensation" is used here simply to define the lack of either the pleasant or unpleasent. This "sensation" is the object of "not-doing".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.10" href="#fn1.10">1.10</a>]</sup></span> <i>Taṇhā.</i> Hungar/thirst. Yearning, wanting, desire, mooning, hankering ... for the stability or further experience of the sensation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.11" href="#fn1.11">1.11</a>]</sup></span> <i>Upādāna. Upa</i> = uprisen; <i>dāna</i> = bound. The plans and intents and actions that are hoped will bring about the desired sense experience. Grasping, upkeep, fuel are some other translations. As laid out in this formula this is a sub-category of <i>saṇkhāra.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n1.12" href="#fn1.12">1.12</a>]</sup></span> <i>Bhava.</i> becoming, existence, life, being, living. PED: "There are 3 states of existence conventionally enumerated as <i>kāma-, rūpa-, arūpa-</i> or sensual existence, deva-corporeal, and formless existence." Here what is intended is the possibility of rebirth in a sub-human, human, deity, or purely mental state. All are considered states of sense-existence, and this is an all-inclusive list of states of existence, or sense-existence.</p>

But the idea of 'cause' is superimposed on the thinking of the time (which is that things come to be driven by forces) and introduces a viewpoint that obscures the picture.</p>

Neither Rhys Davids' 'cause' nor <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'condition'. Rhys Davids and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi focus on the switch from 'who' to 'what', but the Buddha's objection is not so much to the 'who' — the Buddha objects to the ideas 'feeds on', 'touches', 'intends' and 'cognizes' as implying the nourishment of a being that is feeding, where what is intended is that these foods <i>further</i> or bring about <i>further</i> existence.

					Feer, PTS, and CSCD have only #s 1 and 3. This could be a copy and paste error but it is not unreasonable to think that this might have actually been the case or even that the four possibilities were given. If seen as it is in reality whether arising or ending, one does not hold views about its existence or non-existence.<br />
					Walshe has it that this is actually 'seeing' something there rather than seeing something there and holding a view about it, but the discussion focuses on the two extreme theories held by the world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n27.5" href="#fn27.5">27.5</a>]</sup></span> <i>Upādāna.</i> Up-hold, up-bind. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro: 'fuel;' Bhk Bodhi: 'clinging'; Mrs. Rhys Davids: 'grasping'. The idea is that upon experience of a sensation and the arising of desire to re-experience that sensation, or to et way from it if it is painful, these things provide excuses or reasons or bases ... supports ... plans ... intentions ... fuel ... for rationalizing the taking up of a new existence. They uphold existence. 'Support ending, existence ends' is what is indicated when through taking up a device like investigation of the foulness of the body, or finding no basis for ambition in any aspect of the world, one finds existence repulsive and finding it repulsive one lets it go. Existence no longer has the illusion of pleasure or beauty or reasons for ambition as support and without that support there is no taking the action that is required to enter existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n27.6" href="#fn27.6">27.6</a>]</sup></span> <i>Taṇhā.</i> Thirst, hunger, desire to experience through the senses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="n27.7" href="#fn27.7">27.7</a>]</sup></span> <i>Dhamma-taṇhā.</i> Lower-case 'd'. Things. In this case mental objects. But 'things' rather than 'The <i>Dhamma</i>' or just 'Ideas' because the objects of the mind where, as here, limited to mind as it relates to existence, are the forms of consciousness arising from the contact of the other senses with their objects as well as thoughts, ideas, consciousness itself, and consciousness of the formless spheres.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n27.8" href="#fn27.8">27.8</a>]</sup></span> <i>Nāma-rūpa.</i> Name-form or shape. Phe-nomena. A close approximation of what we understand to be perception. The identification of a 'thing' by its 'name'. The two are co-terminus, cannot exist one without the other. All existing things consist of name/form + consciousness and the combined three are called 'contact'. In the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15"><i>Māha Nidana Suttaṃ</i></a> the Buddha describes how it is contact of consciousness with named form that constitutes existence. It is the separation of consciousness from named-form-consciousness (or consciousness through the senses) that stops the progression of the chain of interdependent factors bringing pain to an end, that is, <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n27.9" href="#fn27.9">27.9</a>]</sup></span> <i>Saṇkhāra.</i> Identification with the intent to create personal experience through acts of body, speech and mind and the identified-with result. A near synonym of <i>kamma,</i> but with emphasis on the process of personalization. Mrs. Rhys Davids 'activities' conveys only half the meaning; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'volitional formations' conveys only the other half. Volitional activities and their resultant identified-with formations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="n27.10" href="#fn27.10">27.10</a>]</sup></span> <i>Dhamma-sota.</i> I say '<i>Dhamma</i>-ear'. PED and most translators say "<i>Dhamma</i>-stream" or "Stream of the". <i>Sotāpatti</i> is almost always translated 'Streamwinner', including by me, but I believe the earlier version was '<i>Dhamma</i>-ear' and 'stream' was used primarily to symbolize the pull <i>(āpo)</i> of worldly life.</p>
