					<p class="f4"><b>Introduction</b></p>
					
					<p class="f4">This formula has nothing to do with 'causation'. Blindness does not cause consciousness. Consciousness, in this case consciousnes of identification with named forms, is one of any number of things that might result from blindness. To understand the point, you need to start at the other end: "How does one get rid of grief and lamentation, pain and misery, and despair?" That is accomplished by no longer identifying with the individuality that is the result of blindness as to where it always ends. This is the story of how that identification occurs and how it can be made not to recur. That it can be brought to an end is the position taken by the Buddha that is being explained in the yarns of this chapter of the <i>Saṃutta Nikāya.</i> I believe the suttas of this chapter should be read together.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Paṭicca.</i> PED: "gerund of <i>Pacceti [paṭi + i]</i> to come onto, come back to, figurative fall back on." <i>Paṭi:</i> PED: "directional prefix in well-defined meaning of "back (to), against, towards, in opposition to, opposite." The idea is rebounding, percussing, bouncing off. If tied to this, that rebounds off it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Samuppāda. Sam + uppāda.</i> Self arising. Taken as having the double meaning of "arising by itself" and "arising as the self".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> PED: The <i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i> is also called the <i>Nidāna paccayākāra. Nidāna Paccaya Saṅkhāra</i> Tied down Rebounding Own-making. PED: The oldest account is found in the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14"><i>Mahāpadāna Suttanta</i></a> of the <b><i>Dīgha Nikāya.</i></b> (Also see: <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">Mahā-Nidāna Suttanta</a>)<br />
					<i>Nidāna</i> PED: (neuter) [Sanskrit <i>nidāna, ni + dāna Ni</i> = down; <i>dāna</i> = bound. The name given to the first knot in the weaving of a rug. PED: <i>dā, dyati</i> to bind, <i>cf.</i> Greek δέσμα, δῆμα (fetter) ... (a) (noun) tying down to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Saṅkhāra. San</i> = 0wn, or 
					self; <i>khāra</i> = make. Identification with the intent to create personal experience by way of thoughts, words, or deeds, and the identification with the resultant thing made. The difference between this and <i>kamma</i> is in the intent to create experience for the self. The whole point of this formula is the explanation of how the identification of self comes to be attached to sense experience. It happens because that thing there that is currently identified with as self intends to extend that life through its actions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Viññāṇa.</i> Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge. The knowledge of knowing the known. Awareness of knowing. Kenning: knowing. Called consciousness here because that is how it is generally known. In this case its intended meaning is "sense-consciousness".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Nāma-rūpa. Nāma</i> = name; <i>rūpa</i> = form. All existing things, (existing in what the 
					Buddha taught meaning perceived through the senses) including things with no apparent shape such as wave-forms, sounds, and beings that do not have visible bodies, are characterized as having substance and are named.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Saḷāyatana. Sala</i> = six; <i>ayatana</i> = realms. The realm of the senses: eye and visible objects; ear and sounds; nose and scents; tongue and tastes; body and touches; mind and mental objects (mental objects being the sense-conscousneses of the other senses plus memory). All six together also known as "The All" meaning that this group encompasses everything that has come into existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Phassa.</i> Touch, meaning contact.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Vedanā.</i> Experience. To be understood 3 different ways: as the <b>experience</b> of the Arahant, as the <b>sense-experience</b> of the ordinary being, and as here, the <b>sensation</b> arising from consciousness of contact of sense-organ with sense-object. Sensation is experienced in three ways: as pleasant, as unpleasant, and as neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Sensation that  is experienced as neither unpleasant nor pleasant is experienced in 2 ways: by the ignorant, world-bound individual as being a lack of stimulation and therefore to be replaced as soon as possible with some pleasaant stimulation; and by the one on the path to the end of pain as a taste of <i>Nibbāna.</i> In neither case of the sensation that is neither unpleasant nor unpleasant is it a feeling, that is, 'neutral' sensation. "Sensation" is used here simply to define the lack of either the pleasant or unpleasent. This "sensation" is the object of "not-doing".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Taṇhā.</i> Hungar/thirst. Yearning, wanting, desire, mooning, hankering ... for the stability or further experience of the sensation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Upādāna. Upa</i> = uprisen; <i>dāna</i> = bound. The plans and intents and actions that are hoped will bring about the desired sense experience. Grasping, upkeep, fuel are some other translations. As laid out in this formula this is a sub-category of <i>saṅkhāra.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Bhava.</i> becoming, existence, life, being, living. PED: "There are 3 states of existence conventionally enumerated as <i>kāma-, rūpa-, arūpa-</i> or sensual existence, deva-corporeal, and formless existence." Here what is intended is the possibility of rebirth in a sub-human, human, deity, or purely mental state. All are considered states of sense-existence, and this is an all-inclusive list of states of existence, or sense-existence.</p>
