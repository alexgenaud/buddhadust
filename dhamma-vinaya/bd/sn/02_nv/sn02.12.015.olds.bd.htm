					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi-town</a> revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anathapiṇḍika's Sporting Grounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, the Ancient of the Clan Kaccayana<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					went to where The Lucky Man was located,<br />
					where he drew near and<br />
					having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />
					the Ancient of the Clan Kakkayana<br />
					said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Consummate view, consummate view', <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					is the saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent, then, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					is there consummate view?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, as to this, Kaccayana,<br />
					the world is mostly split,<br />
					adhering to 'this exists'<br />
					or to 'this exists not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Kaccayana,<br />
					the arising of the world<br />
					is seen in its reality<br />
					with consummate wisdom,<br />
					one does not hold that<br />
					'this exists not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Kaccayana,<br />
					the ending of the world<br />
					is seen in its reality<br />
					with consummate wisdom<br />
					one does not hold that<br />
					'this exists'.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as to this, Kaccayana,<br />
					the world is mostly bound up<br />
					down-bound<br />
					up end down,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but those who do not welcome,<br />
					who do not take hold of<br />
					the bias of a clinging and<br />
					attached heart<br />
					do not think in terms of<br />
					'self' or 'me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just pain arises<br />
					in the arisen,<br />
					pain passes away<br />
					in the passed away,'<br />
					he doubts not,<br />
					nor wavers —</p>

					<p class="f4">Not following<br />
					anyone else<br />
					he knows this for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">This far then Kaccāna,<br />
					one has consummate view.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Everything exists',<br />
					this Kaccāna,<br />
					is the first end.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nothing exists',<br />
					this is<br />
					the second end.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Kaccāna,<br />
					The-Getter-of-the-Getting,<br />
					not going towards<br />
					either end<br />
					teaches a 'middle-way':</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebounding off blindness, beggars,<br />
					own-making<br />
					rebounding off own-making,<br />
					consciousness<br />
					rebounding off consciousness,<br />
					named-form<br />
					rebounding off named-form,<br />
					the six-realms<br />
					rebounding off the six-realms,<br />
					touch<br />
					rebounding off touch,<br />
					sensation<br />
					rebounding off sensation,<br />
					thirst<br />

					bind-ups<br />
					rebounding off bind-ups,<br />
					existence<br />
					rebounding off existence,<br />
					birth<br />
					rebounding off birth,<br />
					aging and death<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery<br />
					and despair<br />
					become one's own.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even thus<br />
					is the self-arising<br />
					of this pile of pain<br />
					made to be.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But with the<br />
					utterly-dispassionately-endinding of blindness,<br />
					own-making is ended<br />
					own-making ended,<br />
					consciousness is ended<br />
					consciousness ended,<br />
					named-form is ended<br />
					named-form ended,<br />
					the six-realms are ended<br />

					birth is ended<br />
					birth ended,<br />
					aging and death<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery<br />
					and despair<br />
					are ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so<br />

					made to not be."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> We can hear this something like: "... of the Apache tribe," and later for when The Lucky Man addresses him: "... for the most part, Apache."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> BJT in my version and in the version on ATI has the sequence as:<br />
					1. seeing the arising — not holding the view 'it exists not'<br />
					2. seeing the ending — not holding the view 'it exists not'<br />
					3. seeing the ending — not holding the view 'it exists'<br />
					Feer, PTS, and CSCD have only #s 1 and 3. This could be a copy and paste error but it is not unreasonable to think that this might have actually been the case or even that the four possibilities were given. If seen as it is in reality whether arising or ending, one does not hold views about its existence or non-existence.<br />
					Walshe has it that this is actually 'seeing' something there rather than seeing something there and holding a view about it, but the discussion focuses on the two extreme theories held by the world.</p>
