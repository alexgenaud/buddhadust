					<p class="f4">Once upon a time in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi-town:</a></p>					

					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Upavāṇa<br />
					went to where The Lucky Man was located,<br />
					and approached.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having approached The Lucky Man,<br />
					he gave courteous salutation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having exchanged courteous greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seated to one side, then<br />
					Old Man Upavāṇa said this to The Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are, <i>bhante</i>,<br />
					some shamans and Brahmins,<br />
					speakers on <i>kamma</i><br />
					who lay down the view<br />
					that pleasure and pain is<br /> 
					made by the self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are also, <i>bhante</i>,<br />
					some shamans and Brahmins,<br />
					speakers on <i>kamma</i><br />
					who lay down the view<br />
					that pleasure and pain is<br /> 
					made by another.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are also, <i>bhante</i>,<br />
					some shamans and Brahmins,<br />
					speakers on <i>kamma</i><br />
					who lay down the view<br />
					that pleasure and pain is both<br />
					made by the self and<br />
					made by another.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are also, <i>bhante</i>,<br />
					some shamans and Brahmins,<br />
					speakers on <i>kamma</i><br />
					who lay down the view<br />
					that pleasure and pain is neither<br />
					made by the self nor<br />
					made by another but<br />
					is spontaneously self-arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, <i>bhante</i>,<br />
					what does The Lucky Man say,<br />
					what does he teach?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How relating and<br /> 
					speaking accurately,<br />
					in such a way as to be blameless,<br />
					do we explain his<br />
					Dhamma within the <i>Dhamma</i> and<br />
					not falsely misrepresent<br />
					The Lucky Man<br />
					by contesting his <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					with what is not-Dhamma?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Upavāṇa,<br />
					I have spoken of pleasure and pain as<br />
					reboundingly-self-arisen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Off what rebounding?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Off touch rebounding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way one would be<br />
					relating and<br /> 
					speaking accurately,<br />
					in such a way as to be blameless,<br />
					explaining my<br />
					Dhamma within the <i>Dhamma</i> and<br />
