					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">There to the beggars gathered round he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Four, beggars, are the foods for sustaining living beings<br />
					or for the assistance of beings seeking to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What Four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material Food, hard or soft,<br />
					contact for a second,<br />
					intentions for a third,<br />
					consciousness for a fourth.</p>

					<h4>Material Food</h4>

					<p class="f4">And how, Beggars, is Material Food to be regarded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, Beggars, a loving family of three:<br />
					Father,<br />
					Mother,<br />
					and their only child,<br />
					a newly born infant,<br />
					dearly beloved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then imagine this family has gotten itself lost in the desert,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><img src="../../../../resources/images/sign_1.5.gif" width="19" height="36" alt="sign #1" />one,</p>

							      <p class="f4 in4"><img src="../../../../resources/images/sign_2.5.gif" width="23" height="36" alt="sign #2" />two,</p>

									      <p class="f4 in6"><img src="../../../../resources/images/sign_3.5.gif" width="25" height="36" alt="sign #3" />three days,</p>

					<p class="f4">their food used up,<br />
					tired,<br />
					thirsty<br />
					and hungry...</p>

					<p class="f4">four, five, six days...<br />
					seven days...<br />
					... eight days ...<br />
					... nine days ...<br />
					... ten days ...<br />
					... and maybe even longer ...</p>

					<p class="f4">but whatever the case, Beggars,<br />
					there comes a time<br />
					sooner or later<br />
					when that Mother and Father decide,<br />
					tearful and broken up in heart:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Let us then use our only child,<br />
					dearly beloved<br />
					as food,<br />
					so that we do not all perish!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then they slay that child of theirs,<br />
					a newly born infant,<br />
					dearly beloved,<br />
					and cutting it up<br />
					they divide it into fresh pieces<br />
					and pieces to be dried,<br />
					weeping and lamenting.</p>

					<p class="f4">And by eating this food<br />
					with tears in their eyes<br />
					and sorrow in their hearts<br />
					they survive that desert<br />
					and arrive safely back at their home.</p>

					<p class="f4">Although they might live many years longer,<br />
					would they ever lose consciousness of the fact<br />
					that they had slain their only child,<br />
					a newly born infant,<br />
					dearly beloved<br />
					in order to survive?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Beggars,<br />
					is Material food to be regarded by you.</p>

					<p class="f4">"By one who understands Material Food in this way,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kamacchanda.htm">the passions of the five senses</a> are understood;<br />
					when the passions of the five senses are understood;<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm">the yokes that bind to rebirth</a> in this world<br />
					have ceased to exist."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<h4>Sense Stimulation</h4>

					<p class="f4">And how, Beggars is the food that is <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/phassa.htm">sense stimulation</a> to be considered?</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine a cow with a sore hide.</p>

					<p class="f4">If she stands leaning against a wall<br />
					the creatures living on the wall bite her;<br />
					if she stands leaning against a tree,<br />
					the creatures living on the tree bite her;<br />
					whatever she leans against,<br />
					there the creatures that live there bite her.</p>

					<p class="f4">If she stands in the water,<br />
					the creatures that live there bite her;<br />
					if she stands in the open air,<br />
					the creatures that live there bite her;<br />
					whatever she leans against,<br />
					there the creatures that live there bite her.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way sense stimulation is to be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who understands the food that is sense stimulation in this way<br />
					understands <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vedana.htm">the three sense experiences;</a><br />
					when the three sense experiences are understood<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there is nothing more that needs to be done.</p>

					<h4>Intention</h4>

					<p class="f4">And how is the food that is intention<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> to be considered?</p>

						<div class="floatlpp wpx150 mart6">

							<p>A pit of smokeless charcoal,<br />
							deeper than a man is tall,<br />
							red hot,<br />
							glowing,<br />
							ablaze<br />
							— a simile for woman.</p>

							<p><img src="../../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Imagine a pit of smokeless charcoal,<br />
					deeper than a man is tall,<br />
					red hot,<br />
					glowing,<br />
					ablaze<br />
					and here come some beggar who loves life,<br />
					dislikes death,<br />
					loves happiness,<br />
					dislikes pain,<br />
					and two strong men grab him<br />
					one at each arm<br />
					and drag him,<br />
					twisting This Way and that,<br />
					to that very pit of smokeless charcoal,<br />
					deeper than a man is tall,<br />
					red hot,<br />
					glowing,<br />
					ablaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, beggars,<br />
					would that man not wish to be out of that situation,<br />
					out of the grip of those two strong men,<br />
					far from that place?</p>

					<p class="f4">And, How Come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he would be thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ho boy! I fall in<br />
					with that pit of smokeless charcoal,<br />
					deeper than a man is tall,<br />
					red hot,<br />
					glowing,<br />
					ablaze,<br />
					it's death<br />
					or excruciating deadly pain<br />
					for me,<br />
					for sure!'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how come.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way intention is to be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the food that is intention is understood,<br />
					the three <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/tanha.htm">thirsts</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> are understood;<br />
					when the three thirsts are understood,<br />
					there is nothing more that needs to be done.</p>

					<h4>Consciousness</h4>

					<p class="f4">And how is the food that is consciousness to be considered?</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine a criminal who is brought before the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">The guards say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your Highness, this is a robber,<br />
					a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					a no-good,<br />
					good for nuth'n,<br />
					murder'n sum-gum<br />
					fo shu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let your Highness inflict upon him<br />
					such punishment as he deserves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So the king says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Take this man<br />
					and bind him hand and foot<br />
					and place him in a cart<br />
					and parade him around town<br />
					and then take him out the south gate<br />
					and there cut him a hundred times.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the guards do just that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at noon the King asks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is that man?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the guards respond:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this time he is still living, sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, cut this man another hundred times.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the guards do that,<br />
					and again at dusk the King asks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is that man?'</p>

					<p class="f4">and the guards respond:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this time he is still living, sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the king commands<br />
					that the guards cut him<br />
					with another hundred cuts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man,<br />
					thus cut 300 times<br />
					experience death<br />
					or excruciating deadly pains<br />
					as a consequence?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how the food that is consciousness is to be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness is considered in this way,<br />
					named form is understood<br />
					and when named form is understood<br />
					there is nothing more that needs to be done."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
