					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, The Lucky Man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> revisiting,<br />
					Vulture Mount,<br />
					Sow's Digs.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, The Lucky Man,<br />
					afore-time having taken up<br />
					his bowl and robes<br />
					entered Rājagaha<br />
					on his begging rounds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Kasapa the unclothed,<br />
					seeing The Lucky Man in the distance<br />
					drew near and<br />
					having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					stood to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Standing to one side then,<br />
					said this<br />
					to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would question the Venerable Gotama<br />
					on a certain point<br />
					if Gotama would become one<br />
					to give permission<br />
					for this mode of answering questions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is not the time, now, Kassapa,<br />
					for questions,<br />
					we have entered the outskirts of the village."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br />
					Kasapa the unclothed<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would question the Venerable Gotama<br />
					on a certain point<br />
					if Gotama would become one<br />
					to give permission<br />
					for this mode of answering questions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a second time<br />
					The Lucky Man said this to<br />
					Kasapa the unclothed:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is not the time, now, Kassapa,<br />
					for questions,<br />
					we have entered the outskirts of the village."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a third time<br />
					Kasapa the unclothed<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would question the Venerable Gotama<br />
					on a certain point<br />
					if Gotama would become one<br />
					to give permission<br />
					for this mode of answering questions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a third time<br />
					The Lucky Man said this to<br />
					Kasapa the unclothed:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is not the time, now, Kassapa,<br />
					for questions,<br />
					we have entered the outskirts of the village."</p>

					<p class="f4">This said,<br />
					Kasapa the unclothed<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We will not put forward<br />

					<p class="f4">"Question, Kassapa,<br />
					whatever you want."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, how is it good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made<br />
					by one's self?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Kassapa"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then one more, good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made<br />
					by another?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Kassapa"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then one more, good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made<br />
					by one's self, and<br />
					another?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Kassapa"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then one more, good Gotama —<br />
					is pain made by<br />
					neither one's self, nor<br />
					another — <br />
					but has arisen as self spontaneously?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No indeed, it is not thus Kassapa"<br />
					said The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, good Gotama —<br />
					is there no such thing as pain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Kassapa,<br />
					it is not that<br />
					there is no such thing as pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is pain, Kassapa."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it then put forward, Gotama,<br />
					that he does not know<br />
					does not see<br />
					pain?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No, Kassapa, I am not one<br />
					who does not know<br />
					does not see<br />
					pain.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am one who knows pain, Kassapa,<br />
					I am one who sees pain Kassapa."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Then, how is it good Gotama —<br />

					<p class="f4">Teach me, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					The Lucky Man's "pain,"<br />

					about The Lucky Man's "pain."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'He who acts<br />

					remembering one's heedlessness<br />
					'is pain made by one's self' —<br />

					<p class="f4">Avoiding both sides<sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup>,
					Kassapa,<br /> 
					the Tathāgata teaches you<br />
					a middle <i>Dhamma</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebounding off blindness, beggars,<br />
					own-making<br />
					rebounding off own-making,<br />
					consciousness<br />
					rebounding off consciousness,<br />
					named-form<br />
					rebounding off named-form,<br />

					birth<br />
					rebounding off birth,<br />
					aging and death<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery<br />
					and despair<br />
					become one's own.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even thus<br />
					is the self-arising<br />
					of this pile of pain<br />
					made to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you<br />
					utterly-dispassionately-end blindness,<br />
					own-making is ended<br />
					own-making ended,<br />
					consciousness is ended<br />
					consciousness ended,<br />
					named-form is ended<br />

					the six-realms ended,<br />

					pain and misery<br />
					and despair<br />
					are ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so<br />
					is this pile of pain<br />
					made to not be."</p>					

					<p class="f4">This said, Kassapa the unclothed
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as though, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					one were to set upright the upside-down,<br />
					or uncover the covered,<br />
					or to show the way to one who was lost,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that creatures there might see:<br />
					'There are Forms!'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, The Lucky Man<br /> 
					has in many a figure<br />
					presented his <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I take myself to The Lucky Man for refuge,<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Dhamma</i> for refuge;<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Saṅgha</i> for refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would receive the going forth<br />
					in the presence of The Lucky Man,<br />
					taking on full ordination."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whoever Kassapa<br />
					formerly of another position,<br />
					wishes to leave the world<br />
					wishes to take on this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline,<br />
					he undergoes four months probation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four months having passed,<br />
					having fulfilled probation,<br />
					the <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					having so decided,<br />
					being willing,<br /><br />
					may have him go forth into homelessness,<br />
					taking on the higher ordination<br /> 
					in the <i>bhikkhu</i> life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But nevertheless I recognize differences in persons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, <i>Bhante,</i>
					one formerly of another position,<br />
					wishes to leave the world<br />
					wishes to take on this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline,<br />
					undergoes four months probation<br />
					and four months having passed,<br />
					having fulfilled probation,<br />
					the <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					having so decided,<br />
					being willing,<br /><br />
					may have him go forth into homelessness,<br />
					taking on the higher ordination<br /> 
					in the <i>bhikkhu</i> life<br />
					I will undergo four years probation<br />
					and four years having passed,<br />
					having fulfilled probation,<br />
					the <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					having so decided,<br />
					being willing,<br /><br />
					may have me go forth into homelessness,<br />
					taking on the higher ordination<br /> 
					in the <i>bhikkhu</i> life."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kassapa the unclothed received the going forth<br />
					in the presence of The Lucky Man,<br />
					and took on full ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after his ordination,<br />
					Kassapa the unclothed,<br />
					living apart,<br />
					careful, ardent, self-determined,<br />
					quickly achieved that aim,<br />
					that unsurpassed Best of Lives,<br />
					for which the sons of clansmen go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					experiencing it for himself<br />
					in this seen thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knew from personal experience that:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Left behind is rebirth<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no further it'n-'n-at'n' for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Kassapa the unclothed<br />
					became another one of the Arahants.</p>
