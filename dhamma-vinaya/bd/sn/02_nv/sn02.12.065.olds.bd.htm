					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town come-a revisit'n.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he says to the Beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A world of woe!" he says, "Woe is the World!</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, Beggars, while still a youth with coal black hair,<br />

					<p class="f4">Here in this world<br />

					<p class="f4">"To me, Beggars," he says,<br />

					<p class="f4">To have consciousness as an individual<br />

					<p class="f4">What I saw, Beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is what gives rise to this whole mess of Dukkha.</p>

					<p class="f4">What I saw, Beggars was what had not been known before:<br />

					<p class="f4">This Dukkha is a thing that can be eliminated.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that I saw the light,<br />
					I got the point,<br />
					I had discovered the key<br />

					'these things can be eliminated!'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way as if a man who was crossing through the jungle<br />

					complete with pleasure gardens,<br />
					orchards,<br />
					ponds,<br />
					and ancient ruins...<br />
					a really splendid old place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, taking this discovery to the King,<br />
					and describing its wonders<br />
					and swearing to being an eye-witness to it's existence,<br />
					he begs of the king<br />
					that he restore this citadel<br />
					to it's former glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that the king does,<br />
					and thereafter that citadel becomes populous<br />
					and comes to growth and prosperity<br />
					as in ancient times gone by.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Beggars,<br />
					I have seen an ancient path<br />
					traversed by old-time men of knowledge<br />
					in days gone by.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that path?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this very Aristocratic Eight-Dimensional High Way, that is:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In this re-telling I have tried to balance a good reading of the Pali with a clear presentation of the way I see this in actual meditation practice where the overall idea is that it is unacceptable just to throw up one's hands and say 'It can't be done!'. What needs to be expressed, and is not getting across in the various translations, is that what is being described in the Paticca Samuppada is a "process" — the process of things coming to be, and that because this is a process of things coming to be there is inherent in that the possibility of escaping that process in so far as it requires our cooperation to go on. (In other words, the world experienced by the individual is not something that once set rolling, either by past kamma, or by fate, or by 'the way the world works,' cannot be altered.) This is what the Buddha is describing himself as discovering in this sutta.<br />
					What I would really like to be doing with the opening of this is to be throwing in there a half dozen ways of describing how what we are to be looking for is something in the visible present-time here and now, real world that is within our power to change in order to escape the end result of this process in Aging and Death. We don't want to be thinking theory here at all, we want to be looking at what is, and what is actually present and how that is actually operating. So naturally my choice of words has again taken some turns which I will footnote as they come up.<br />
					This effort was stimulated by a mistranslation by Mrs. Rhys Davids where she speaks of the Buddha thinking: "What now being" where the Pali reads "what being", (Bodhi: 'When what exists') taking her clue from the commentary which is trying to explain the missing "Avijja &gt; Sankara" by explaining that "This version" is dealing only with this present life. (Did they forget that they usually explain that from "upadana" to aging and death is the future life?)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samudaya.htm">Samudaya:</a> I am tempted to use "that has x as it's comeuppance." Sam = Own, Self, With; udaya = rising. Own-grown; Self-rising; Self-originating; </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>  <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/yoniso-manasikara.htm">Yoniso Manasikārā:</a> Womb-so (such); Mind-so; Seek-make. Tracing things mentally to their point of origin (womb); Getting to the Bottom of the Mater; Getting to the root of the matter; Getting to the Heart of the Matter. But always in this system the idea is to find where things begin, the first mental impulse that starts a chain of events. Thinking things through to the end would be the counterpart to <i>yoniso manasikara.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/bhava.htm">Bhava</a> Bhodi = "existence"; the meaning is living in a world. The Pali resists a static word for this and is really "becoming" or "behaving" or even more basically "bad-going".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/upadana.htm">Upadana</a> The usual translation is "grasping", Bhodi uses clinging. Bhikkhu Thanissaro goes to the meaning as "fuel". Bhante Punnaji goes to the end result in his "personalization." What we need to do here is to see that the previous event (in this sequence the next step, 'tanha' hunger/thirst, desire) dies out if it is not acted on, for the full rolling-out of the process described in the <i>Paticca Samuppada,</i> there must be some point where some action on the part of the individual keeps the ball rolling. With the usual <i>"Avijja &gt; Sankhara"</i> missing from this version, the only place left is here. Then, in your sit down practice, actually look at what is going on: Sitting, things get still. Sitting still, things begin to die off. Resisting that dying off what does one do? In Bhikkhu Thanissaro's terms we fuel the fire (but Bhikkhu Thanissaro's use is of a static condition, of "upadana" as existing fuel, not of "fueling"). We invent something "further," to do. Reacting to desire (I want...) we conjure images of getting... we 'intend', or, reacting to, say, some discomfort in one's seat one acts to change the posture, and so forth. This I call "up-keep" Up Pas Dana "Given" (= bound, kept, done). Previously I have used "going after getting," which will still do, but the idea of "upkeep" carries more of the idea that this is a thing that is keeping a process that has already been set going, rolling on. The converse is the perception you will get in sit down meditation that without upkeep, the whole thing (that is, at least, your personal end of it) will die off.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/phassa.htm">Phassa:</a> note here that part of the idea of contact is the presence of consciousness <i>viññāṇā.</i> And remember also that <i>viññāṇā</i> is inseparable from <i>saññā</i> and <i>vedana,</i> (sensation, perception and consciousness is just a description of three aspects of a unity).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Saḷāyatana:</i> 6-sphere; where six is understood to mean the six senses and their objects, so "the sphere of the six senses, or the scope of the six senses, or the more commonly heard "Realm of the Senses," where here I am turning sphere into "envelopment".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7a" href="#fn7a">7a</a>]</sup> Using the term 'interoperation' here is taking a slight liberty as it does not exist as such in the Pali. I justify this by the fact that it is what it is that is going on in this case and the 'interoperation' part can be inferred from the fact that the terms 'nama' and 'rupa' are made into a compound: 'nameform'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vinnana.htm">Viññāṇā:</a> Where above, as an aspect of contact, I used only "consciousness" for <i>viññāṇā,</i> here I feel the need to break out the meaning as I believe it really is, as is indicated in the word itself: VI = Re- or Double (dvi..sion). In the same way as the co- or con- is lost to our ears in consciousness or cognition, the <i>"vi"</i> is being lost to us in translation. Consciousness is the awareness of knowing as an individual and is consequently consciousness of consciousness (because contact is the coming together of sense organ, sense object and consciousness and is really what we should be calling "sense-consciousness," and this in turn is processed by "mind-consciousness" using the previous as "mind-sense-object," we could even say that what we experience as consciousness, is Re-knowing-knowing ... <i>vi-na-na</i> ... or if you are from New York, <i>vi-nya-.nya.</i> This breakdown is being missed all round as far as I can see and yet it is essential for a comprehension of how it is possible for the arahant to break apart the experience of individualized experience created by the interoperation of <i>nama/rupa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Samudaya</i> again, here with emphasis on the <i>"Saŋ".</i> "Self-rising," if it wern't so easily understood in exactly the opposite of the Buddhist idea. There must be abetter word for this word, but I have not yet found it. The idea is "raised by it's bootstraps"; not created by some external power or god, with co-factors, to be sure, but arising in dependance on them, not caused by or created by them, something that should not be too difficult for those of us with computers to understand. An idiot invented a little pattern with four letters that could look at itself and create a program that could be used to create programs that could be used to experience Aging and Death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair.</p>
