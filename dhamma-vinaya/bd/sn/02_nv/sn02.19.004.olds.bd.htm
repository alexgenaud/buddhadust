					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, The Lucky Man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rajagaha</a><br />
					Bamboo Grove,<br />
					the squirrels' feeding place<br />
					came-a revisiting.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">One time there Old Man Lakkhaṇa and<br />
					Old Man Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					were living on Vulture's Head Mountain.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					having afore-time taken up his bowl and robes,<br />
					approached Old Man Lakkhaṇa<br />
					and drew near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having drawn near to Old Man Lakkhaṇa<br />
					he said this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Let us enter Rājagaha, friend Lakkhaṇa,<br />
					on our begging rounds."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Let it be thus, friend"<br />
					replied Old Man Lakkhaṇa<br />
					to Old Man Mahā-Moggallāna.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					while descending Vulture's Head Mountain and<br />
					reaching a certain place,<br />
					smiled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Lakkhaṇa<br />
					said this to Old Man Mahā-Moggallāna:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What then friend Moggallāna,<br />
					is the driving force,<br /> 
					what then the reason,<br />
					that you go so far as to smile?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is not the time, friend Lakkhaṇa,<br />
					for this question,<br />
					put this question to me<br /> 
					in the presence of The Lucky Man."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Lakkhaṇa and<br />
					Old Man Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					went on their begging rounds in Rājagaha<br />
					ate their food<br />
					and after the meal<br />
					approached The Lucky Man<br />
					and drew near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />
					and having exchanged polite salutations,<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side, then,<br />
					Old Man Lakkhaṇa said this<br />
					to Old Man Mahā Moggallāna:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Here, friend Mahā-Moggallāna
					while descending Vulture's Head Mountain and<br />
					reaching a certain place,<br />
					smiled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What then friend Moggallāna,<br />
					is the driving force,<br /> 
					what then the reason,<br />
					that you went so far as to smile?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here friend,<br />
					as I was descending Vulture's Head Mountain and<br />
					reaching a certain place,<br />
					I saw a person being cut<br />
					going through the air<br />
					oppressed by<br />
					attacks of<br />
					vultures,<br />
					crows,<br />
					hawks,<br />
					one after the other<br />
					pecking it clean<br />
					causing it torment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this, friend, I thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How full of wonder,<br />
					how great is the marvel,<br />
					that a being should come to such a form,<br />
					that a ghost should come to such a form,<br />
					that one who has taken on life<br />
					should come to such a form."</p>

					<p class="f4">At this, then, The Lucky Man<br />
					said this to the beggars:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Eye-become, beggars,<br />
					is the living of the follower,<br />
					knowledge become, beggars,<br />
					is the living of the follower,<br />
					since sucha one<br />
					will know, or<br />
					will see<br />
					the formation of such a thing<br />
					with his own eyes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Before now, beggars,<br />
					I too saw this being<br />
					but I said nothing<br />
					for I predicted<br /> 
					that those in future<br />
					might not believe me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Had they not believed me,<br />
					that would have been<br />
					for their disadvantage and pain<br />
					for many a long night.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This being, beggars,<br />
					was a lamb butcher<br />
					here in Rājagaha<br />
					he, as the result of this <i>kamma,</i><br />
					spent<br />
					many rains<br />
					many hundereds of rains<br />
					many thousands of rains<br />
					many hundreds of thousands of rains<br />
					boiling in <i>Niraya</i> Hell<br />
					then, as the residual power of this <i>kamma</i><br />
					he has gained this form."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Mrs Rhys Davids and Bhikkhu Bodhi both use "Flayed" along with terms that are not in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> What I have looks like a joke, but is as close as I can come to a good translation. The PED notes: 'The commentary on <b>A</b> III 365 has: <i>nicchedetī ti bāhāya vā rukkhe vā paharati. — nicchedeti (chid)</i> is pardonable because of Prākrit <i>chollai</i> "to cut."'</p>
