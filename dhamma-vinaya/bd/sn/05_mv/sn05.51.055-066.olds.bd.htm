					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Bala.</i> PED goes to Latin de-bilis "without strength" English debility. I hear: Ability. Able. Stable. Balance. I think 'balance' here over 'stability' thinking according to the Dhamma that stability is never really what we get here, even seated on solid ground, standing on solid ground, let alone seated in ethics, standing on ethics. Think of standing on top of a bamboo pole stuck in the ground: is this a deed requiring strength, or stability, or balance? It could be said it needed to be done with ability, but we do not hear this in an enlightening way any longer in the term 'able'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup>PED: a serpent or Nāga demon, playing a prominent part in Buddhist fairy-tales, gifted with miraculous powers and great strength. They often act as fairies and are classed with other divinities (see <i>devatā</i>), with whom they are sometimes friendly, sometimes at enmity (as with the <i>Garu'as</i>).<br />
					The word also is used for Elephant. I am going to make a wild speculation here and call these beings Dragons, as in Chinese Dragons. Even if I am off here, they stand in roughly the same place in terms of symbolism.</p>

					Actually it isn't that easy to see. Especially for those of us that have grown up with almost no contact with farming, but these little spikes can cause enormous pain when they pierce the skin which they find all sorts of ways of doing.
