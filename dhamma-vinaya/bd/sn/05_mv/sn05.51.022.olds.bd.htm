					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There then the Elder Ānanda approached The Lucky Man and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near Bhagava and giving salutation he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, the elder Ānanda said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Has the Lucky Man, then bhante,<br />
					mastered the power of appearing in the brahama-world<br />
					in a mind-made body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed I have mastered, Ānanda,<br />
					the power of appearing in the brahama-world<br />
					in a mind-made body.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. But then bhante, has the Lucky Man mastered the power<br />
					of appearing in the brahma-world<br />
					in this great fourfold organic body?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed I have mastered, Ānanda,<br />
					the power of appearing in the brahma-world<br />
					in this great fourfold organic body.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Omitting,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> bhante,<br />
					that the Lucky Man has the power<br />
					to appear in the brahma-world<br />
					in a mind-made body,<br />
					that The Lucky Man, bhante, has mastered the power<br />
					to appear in the brahma-world<br />
					in this great fourfold organic body — <br />
					this is the working of a miracle<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> bhante,<br />
					an act of super-normality, Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a miracle, Ānanda,<br />
					— the Tathāgata is possessed of miraculous things —<br />
					and it is an act of super-normality, Ānanda,<br />
					— the Tathāgata is possessed of super-normal things.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. At such a time, Ānanda, as the Tathāgata abides<br />
					with body aligned<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> with heart,<br />
					and heart aligned with body,<br />
					and body is steeped in<br />
					perception of pleasure,<br />
					perception of lightness,<br />
					at such a time Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata's body becomes light,<br />
					maluable,<br />
					workable,<br />
					glowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. In the same way, Ānanda,<br />
					that a glop of iron heated all day<br />
					becomes light,<br />
					maluable,<br />
					workable,<br />
					glowing,<br />
					at such a time, Ānanda, as the Tathāgata abides<br />
					with body aligned with heart,<br />
					and heart aligned with body,<br />
					and body is steeped in<br />
					perception of pleasure,<br />
					perception of lightness,<br />
					at such a time, Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata's body becomes light,<br />
					maluable,<br />
					workable,<br />
					glowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. At such a time, Ānanda, as the Tathāgata abides<br />
					with body aligned with heart,<br />
					and heart aligned with body,<br />
					and body is steeped in<br />
					perception of pleasure,<br />
					perception of lightness,<br />
					at such a time, Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata is able,<br />
					with little difficulty<br />
					to separate off<br />
					and rise up into the air<br />
					and he experiences not just one variety of magic power:</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one he also becomes many,<br />
					being many he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here, transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged<br />
					like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand<br />
					the Moon and Sun,<br />
					as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body even in the Brahma world.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. In the same way, Ānanda,<br />
					as a light tuft of thistle-down<br />
					or cotton-down<br />
					is with little difficulty<br />
					able to separate off<br />
					and rise up into the air<br />
					carried by the wind,<br />
					at such a time, Ānanda, as the Tathāgata abides<br />
					with body aligned with heart,<br />
					and heart aligned with body,<br />
					and body is steeped in<br />
					perception of pleasure,<br />
					perception of lightness,<br />
					at such a time, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Cātummahābhūtikena.</i> The equivalent of the four great data: Earth, Water, Firelight, Wind. The meaning of <i>Bhūta</i> here would then be 'elemental properties of a living thing.' The term is used to denote a living organism and an inanimate natural object. Generally the translation 'the four great elements' is used for <i>'mahā dhatu'</i>.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: this body composed of the four great elements,<br />
					Woodward: this (physical) body of the four great elements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Opāti &gt; Opāteti<sup>2</sup>.</i> to drop, to omit. Bhk. Bodhi and Woodward struggle to make the word fit the meaning that appears to be most reasonable to them, that is that Ānanda is praising both powers. They make a big deal about the difficulty caused by this term and then, essentially,  ignore it. I suggest that we think in terms of the skeptic: "OK, so he can imagine himself in the brahma world. Big deal." So Ānanda to emphasize what would astound which is his ability to go there in this body, puts to the side, puts down, drops, the first power as not so miraculous. This reading is supported by the elaboration that follows which deals with how the Tathāgata so works the body that it is able to arise in the Brahma world, and also by the description of this magic power in the list of magic powers as being the ability to appear in the body in the brahma world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> In <a href="sn05.51.014.olds.bd.htm">SN 51.14</a>, I have translated these two terms 'an act of sorcery' and 'an abnormality' to emphasize the likely emotions of the bhikkhus in that situation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Samādahati.</i> In the phrase: <i>Kāyam pi citte samādahati, cittam pi ca kāye samādahati.</i> For those seeking to actually learn the techniques for acquiring magic powers, and for those seeking to create accurate translations, this is the critical word to decipher.<br />
					PED: Samādahati [saŋ+ādahati<sup>1</sup>] to put together S I.169. jotiɱ s. to kindle a fire Vin IV.115; cittaɱ s. to compose the mind, concentrate<br />
					<i>Ādahati</i><sup>1</sup> [ā + dahati<sup>1</sup>] to put down, put on, settle, fix Vism 289 (samaɱ ā. = samādahati). Cp. sam* and ādhiyati.<br />
					<i>Ādahati</i><sup>2</sup> [ā + dahati<sup>2</sup>] to set fire to, to burn J VI.201, 203.<br />
					Dahati<sup>1</sup> (dahate) [Sanskrit dadhāti to put down, set up; *dhe = Gr. <span class="spi">ti/qhmi, Latin facio, Ohg. tuon, Ags. don =  E. to do. See also dhātu] to put, place; take for (acc. or abl.), assume, claim, consider D I.92 (okkākaɱ pitāmahaɱ = ṭhapeti DA I.258); S III.113 (mittato daheyya); A IV.239 (cittaɱ d. fix the mind on); Sn 825 (bālaɱ dahanti mithu aññamaññaɱ = passanti dakkhanti, etc. Nd1 163). Pass dhīyati (q. v.); grd. dheyya (q. v.).   Note. dahati is more frequent in combination with prefixes and compositions like ā-, upa-, pari-, sad-, san-, samā-, etc. pp. hita.<br />
