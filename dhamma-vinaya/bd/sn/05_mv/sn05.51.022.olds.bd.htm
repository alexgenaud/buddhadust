					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Elder Ānanda approached The Lucky Man<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near Bhagava<br />
					and giving salutation<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					the elder Ānanda said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Has the Lucky Man, then Bhante,<br />
					mastered the power<br />
					of appearing in the brahama-world<br />
					in a mind-made body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed I have mastered, Ānanda,<br />
					the power of appearing in the brahama-world<br />
					in a mind-made body."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But then Bhante,<br />
					has the Lucky Man mastered the power<br />
					of appearing in the Brahma<br />
					in this great fourfold organic body?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed I have mastered, Ānanda,<br />
					the power of appearing in the Brahma<br />
					in this great fourfold organic body."</p>

					<p class="f4">Omitting,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Bhante,<br />
					that the Lucky Man has the power<br />
					to appear in the Brahma<br />
					in a mind-made body,<br />
					that The Lucky Man, Bhante,<br />
					has mastered the power<br />
					to appear in the Brahma<br />
					in this great fourfold organic body — <br />
					this is the working of a miracle<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Bhante,<br />
					an act of super-normality, Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a miracle, Ānanda,<br />
					— the <i>Tathāgata</i> is possessed of miraculous things —<br />
					and it is an act of super-normality, Ānanda,<br />
					— the <i>Tathāgata</i> is possessed of super-normal things.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such a time, Ānanda,<br />

					at such a time Ānanda,<br />
					the <i>Tathāgata's</i> body becomes light,<br />
					malleable,<br />
					workable,<br />
					glowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the same way, Ānanda,<br />

					or cotton-down<br />
					is with little difficulty<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Cātum-mahā-bhūtikena.</i> The equivalent of the four great data: Earth, Water, Firelight, Wind. The meaning of <i>Bhūta</i> here would then be 'elemental properties of a living thing.' The term is used to denote a living organism and an inanimate natural object. Generally the translation 'the four great elements' is used for <i>'mahā dhatu.'</i><br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: this body composed of the four great elements,<br />
					Woodward: this (physical) body of the four great elements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Opāti &gt; Opāteti<sup>2</sup>.</i> to drop, to omit. Bhk. Bodhi and Woodward struggle to make the word fit the meaning that appears to be most reasonable to them, that is that Ānanda is praising both powers. They make a big deal about the difficulty caused by this term and then, essentially, ignore it. I suggest that we think in terms of the skeptic: "OK, so he can imagine himself in the Brahma world. Big deal." So Ānanda to emphasize what would astound which is his ability to go there in this body, puts to the side, puts down, drops, the first power as not so miraculous. This reading is supported by the elaboration that follows which deals with how the <i>Tathāgata</i> so works the body that it is able to arise in the Brahma world, and also by the description of this magic power in the list of magic powers as being the ability to appear in the body in the Brahma world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> In <a href="sn05.51.014.olds.bd.htm">SN 51.14,</a> I have translated these two terms 'an act of sorcery' and 'an abnormality' to emphasize the likely emotions of the bhikkhus in that situation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Samādahati.</i> In the phrase: <i>Kāyam pi citte samādahati, cittam pi ca kāye samādahati.</i> For those seeking to actually learn the techniques for acquiring magic powers, and for those seeking to create accurate translations, this is the critical word to decipher.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">PED: <i>Samādahati [saṅ+ādahati</i><sup>1</sup>] to put together S I.169. <i>jotiṃ s.</i> to kindle a fire Vin IV.115; <i>cittaṃ s.</i> to compose the mind, concentrate<br />
					<i>Ādahati</i><sup>1</sup> [<i>ā + dahati</i><sup>1</sup>] to put down, put on, settle, fix Vism 289 <i>(samaṃ ā. = samādahati).</i> Cp. sam* and ādhiyati.<br />
