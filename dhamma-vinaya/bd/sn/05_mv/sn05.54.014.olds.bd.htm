					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Venerable Ānanda approached Bhagava and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Bhagava said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Now can it be, Ānanda that one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfilment four things;<br />
					that four things,<br />
					developed and made made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment seven things;<br />
					that seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment two things?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava is the root of Dhamma for us, bhante,<br />
					Bhagava is the channel for Dhamma<br />
					Bhagava is the custodian.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely it would be well, bhante<br />
					if the point of this were to occur to Bhagava to explain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava saying it,<br />
					the beggars will bear it in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can be, Ānanda that one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfilment four things;<br />
					that four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment seven things;<br />
					that seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment two things."</p>

					<p class="f4">But, bhante, what one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfilment four things;<br />
					what four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment seven things;<br />
					what seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment two things?</p>

					<p class="f4">Recollecting-aspiration-serenity, Ānanda, is one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					that brings to fulfilment the four settings-up of mind;<br />

					developed and made made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment the seven dimensions of awakening;<br />
					the seven dimensions of awakening,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment vision and freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And how developed does recollecting-aspiration-serenity,<br />
					when made much of,<br />

					<p class="f4">6. Here Ānanda, a beggar having gotten himself off to the forest<br />

					or to some empty hut,<br />
					and having taken up his seat there sitting down,<br />
					setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					remembering, he attends to the face,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. If he inspires deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out deeply, he knows:<br />
