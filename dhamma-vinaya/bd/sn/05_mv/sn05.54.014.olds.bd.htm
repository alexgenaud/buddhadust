<meta name="description" content="The M. Olds translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 5 Maha Vagga, Samyutta 54, Sutta 14. The Buddha poses a riddle: Is there one state which completes four; four that complete seven; and seven that complete two. The answer is that minding respiration completes the four arisings of mind, the four arisings of mind completes the seven dimensions of self-awakening; the seven dimensions of self-awakening completes knowledge and vision." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i> Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Venerable Ānanda approached <i>Bhagava</i> and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings together with <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now can it be, Ānanda that one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfillment four things;<br />
					that four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment seven things;<br />
					that seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment two things?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"<i>Bhagava</i> is the root of <i>Dhamma</i> for us, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> is the channel for <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> is the custodian.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely it would be well, Bhante<br />
					if the point of this were to occur to <i>Bhagava</i> to explain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Bhagava</i> saying it,<br />
					the beggars will bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can be, Ānanda that one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfillment four things;<br />
					that four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment seven things;<br />
					that seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment two things."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, <i>Bhante,</i> what one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfillment four things;<br />
					what four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment seven things;<br />
					what seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment two things?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Recollecting-aspiration-serenity, Ānanda, is one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					that brings to fulfillment the four settings-up of mind;<br />

					bring to fulfillment the seven dimensions of awakening;<br />
					the seven dimensions of awakening,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfillment vision and freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how developed does recollecting-aspiration-serenity,<br />
					when made much of,<br />

					setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					remembering, he attends to the face,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
