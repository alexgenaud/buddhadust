					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting, Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man addressed the Beggars there: "Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhadante!" the beggars responded to Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Recollecting aspiration, beggars, developed, made much of, makes for great fruit, great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, is recollecting aspiration developed, made much of, such as makes for great fruit, great benefit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar, recollecting aspiration, simultaneously develops the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">dimension of self-awakening</a> that is <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sati.htm">remembering</a> that agrees with solitude, that agrees with the end of lust, that agrees with ending, culminating in letting go;<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>Sahagata. PED: Saha<sup>1</sup> (indecl.) [fr. sa<sup>3</sup>; cp. Vedic saha] prep. and prefix, meaning: in conjunction with, together, accompanied by; immediately after (with instr.) Vin I.38; Sn 49, 928; Th 2, 414 = 425; sahā Sn 231.-gata accompanying, connected with, concomitant Vin I.10; D II.186; S V.421; Kvu 337; DhsA 157.<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: 'develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness accompanied by mindfulness of breathing...etc'; Woodward: 'cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing...etc.'.<br />
					The question for the meditator is: 'Does this mean: "When one recollects aspiration one <i>is</i> remembering, etc." or "One should remember aspiration while simultaneously...". Since the proposition is that here (in this practice) it is the cultivation of recollecting aspiration that is the basic effort, and that it is by cultivating this practice that the other benefits and developments arise, I opt for the idea that the limb of wisdom is a natural consequence of recollecting aspiration, or, it arises simultaneously.<br />
					This is fundamental to the nature of the redundancy found throughout the suttas, where we often find that one 'Dhamma' is to be equated with another e.g., The Four Truths = Paticca Samuppada.</p>
