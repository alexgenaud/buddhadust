					<p class="f4">42. Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of the four power-paths,<br />

					<p class="f4">For example:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just one birth,<br />
					just two births,<br />
					just three births,<br />
					just four births,<br />
					just five births,<br />

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that reborn here."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with it's makeup in detail,<br />
					he recollects not just one arrangement of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">43. Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of the four power-paths,<br />
					he sees beings with purified godlike sight<br />

					<p class="f4">He knows of beings<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> No nidana, no indication that it is Gotama that is speaking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Pacchā-pure.</i> See the Forum Discussion <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/give_ear/ge_009.after.before.htm">The Eye in the Back of the Head</a> where this is given as an explanation of the meaning:<br />
					...a beggar lives developing<br />
					wish-, energy-, heart-, investigation-<br />
					serenity-connected-exertion-own-making<br />
					such that his<br />
					<i><b>after-before-perception</b></i><br />
					is behind him as it is in front of him<br />
					is in front of him as it is behind him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">...he does this by<br />
					developing his <i><b>perception of the after and of the before</b></i><br />
					such that he gets this perception easily<br />
					because it has been well-studied,<br />
					is well grasped and retained,<br />
					and has been thought-over carefully with intelligence and recollection of experience (that's another word for 'wisdom').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Vasā.</i> the distinction between this and medo is not clear. It appears to have something to do with the degree of solidity, hence the choice here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Lasikā. Spelled kasikā</i> in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> I have here followed the order in the text. In other places I have opted to reorganize the list to point to the way a vivid image of the body is created if one visualizes the parts from the outside top to the inside bottom. Bhante Punnaji has a theory that the mixed up way these body parts are usually listed is deliberate, intended to keep one awake. It is possible both are involved, there is definitely a thrill involved in managing to create the visual image in the mind. 'Brain' is not included in the Pali here but is sometimes included to turn this list into a sort of joke and lesson and to conform with the imagry of the corpses and of the bird torn apart by the winds of the upper atmosphere.<br />
					It is also helpful to visualize that this is a double-ended skin bag, and that awareness of the parts is likened to the knowledge of the bean peddler dumping out his wares, that 'there is rice, there are beans ...'<br />
					So the way I see this developing of the iddhipada is to be understood is as an instruction to apply the disgust one feels at seeing the body in this way to all sorts of birth, whether high or low.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Note that usually these last two items are combined into one: He lives by night, as by day, as by day so by night thus bringing his heart to brilliance. When the two are combined the instruction points to maintaining the perception of light throughout the night. This is how it is understood in the commentaries.<br />
