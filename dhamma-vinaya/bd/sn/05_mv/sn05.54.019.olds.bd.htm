					<p class="f4">3. And how developed, beggars, does recollecting-aspiration-serenity,<br />
					when made much of,<br />
					evolve into the ultimate eradication of the Self-remnants?</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Here beggars, a beggar having gotten himself off to the forest<br />
					or to the root of some tree,<br />
					or to some empty hut,<br />
					and having taken up his seat there sitting down,<br />
					setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					remembering, he attends to the face,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. If he inspires deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he exspires shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. 'Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Addhāna-pariññā.</i> Lifespan-, time-, encompassing-knowledge. The ability to know the duration or 'stretch' of life. It could also be the knowledge of the course, direction or outcome of a life. I have not seen this described. It would fit with a number of episodes where a bhikkhu anounces that he is about to die. It would also fit the case where a bhikkhu is to know when his life-resources are exhosted.</p>
