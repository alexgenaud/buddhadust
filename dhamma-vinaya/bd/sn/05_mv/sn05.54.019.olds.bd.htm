					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Addhāna-pariññā.</i> Lifespan-, time-, encompassing-knowledge. The ability to know the duration or 'stretch' of life. It could also be the knowledge of the course, direction or outcome of a life. I have not seen this described. It would fit with a number of episodes where a <i>bhikkhu</i> announces that he is about to die. It would also fit the case where a <i>bhikkhu</i> is to know when his life-resources are exhausted.</p>
