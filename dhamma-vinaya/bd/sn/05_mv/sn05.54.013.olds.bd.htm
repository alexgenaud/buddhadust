<meta name="description" content="The M. Olds translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 5 Maha Vagga, Samyutta 54, Sutta 13. Ānanda poses a riddle: Is there one state which completes four; four that complete seven; and seven that complete two. The answer is that minding respiration completes the four arisings of mind, the four arisings of mind completes the seven dimensions of self-awakening; the seven dimensions of self-awakening completes knowledge and vision." />

					heart-own-making.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Aniccā.</i> Instability, inconsistency. Change. It is not so much the noticing of change as the noticing that there is nothing there that passes from one perception to the next. Or, to say that another way: there is no 'thing' there which is stable enough to be observed twice or 'constantly,' or 'consistently.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These last two lines are the description of the manner in which mind is to be set up in terms of the body per the Four Settings-up of Mind. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">MN 10</a>. And next below the repetition virtually makes these lines the definition of remembering the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Sādhukaṃ manasikāraṃ.</i> Well mind-studied. Hare: "this in-breathing and out-breathing, this close attention to it, is a certain feeling"; <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's translation is similar to Woodward's; <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro ignores the difference between this and the wording for body and has: "is classed as a feeling among feelings" which is more or less as put here, that is, that upon close examination, breathing is nothing but sensation and the other way around, sensations are all just a form of breathing. In-flow and out-flow. The old 'in-and-out'. In a manner of speaking all <i>rūpa,</i> form, is just the distortion created by the ebb and flow of energy, aka, breath.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This is a good example of Gotama's sense of humor. 'Obviously' developing serenity through attention to breathing by reflecting on the mind, developing contentment with the mind, composing the mind and liberating the mind is remembering the mental states. If this needs to be explained, one is absent-minded and lacking in self-awareness.</p>
