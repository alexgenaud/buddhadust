					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Bodhisatta.</i> Awakening-being. Before it became commonly understood in the Theravada tradition to be a person intent on becoming a Buddha, or in the Mahayana tradition, one who has taken the 'Bodhisatta Vow,' to give up attaining Arahantship until all beings can be saved. So here: you are intent on Awakening, you are a bodhisatta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> I have changed the construction of this. In the original it reads:<br />
					<i>3. "Idha bhikkhave chanda-samādhi-padhāna-saŋkhāra-samannāgataɱ iddhipādaɱ bhāveti.<br />
					Iti me chando na ca atilīno bhavissati ...</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">In this case [Here] a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.<br />
					"Thus my wishing will be not too sluggish ...</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This does not make sense. Woodward has added ('with the intent') in brackets: "... with the co-factors of concentration and struggle, (with this intent): Thus shall not my thought be ..."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Bhk. Bodhi has added "...thinking:"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">For me this points to one of the main functions of The Seven Dimensions of Self-Awakening, and is a tool for balancing energy in the development of the power path not a result of developing the power-path. This fits in with the way I read the intent of the sutta: that is, to describe how to develop the paths and the results to be expected. If we jump right into the results at the start of the sutta, we get no instructions as to how to develop the paths, only results. And see below § 8 that indicates that the above was instruction as to development.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Aneka-vihitaɱ.</i> Not-one-arrangement. This term, used also above at §8 here is generally ignored by translators as is the 'pi' in the list that follows: i.e., the 'just'. The result is a translation that suggests that what is happening here is the recollection of one or two or three births and so forth. Re-inserting the idea of 'arrangement' and 'just' we arrive at an understanding that is significantly different: the recollection of the arrangement of one's previous births as in an arrangement with only one birth, or as in an arrangement with only two births, or in multiple births, or, as at the end of the list, not in births as such but as in the evolution and devolution of the entire duration of the world or multiple such evolutions and devolutions. Different arrangements, as might be suggested by translating 'nivasa' not as 'lives' but 'vestments'. Clothing. My 'inhabitations'.<br />
					This would account for the missing 'jati' or 'birth' in the last three arrangments in the list. This would suggest that what was being referred to was the way in which Brahma is said to experience life, as an opening and shutting of his eyes, each opening being an evolution of the world and each closing it's devolution.<br />
					This understanding would clear up a couple of problems I have heard of with regard to the recollection of lives: The first is the experience of some who are able to recollect previous lives that the lives they are recollecting are always the same life with variations. The second is the problem encountered as one more and more clearly sees that there is no thing there that is the self ... and that is that there never was. What then can be called a 'previous life'? Related to this is the perception that follows that there is no way to distinguish the recollection of 'one's own' life from that of any 'other' — in other words, within the boundry set out by stream-winning, one can not say one has not been all. And Brhama, in fact, so we hear, does experience them all as 'himself'. "I am everything and everything is me." All such perceptions are actually recorded in the suttas. It is never said that these beliefs were not based on real experiences, on the contrary in the concluding section of <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.01.6.olds.bd_end.htm#p107">DN 1</a>, we have:</p>

					      <p class="in4">"All of these shaman and Brahman who speculate about the past and the future or both do so based on what they have experienced and are but the struggles of the downbound, blinded by desire, to explain what they do not understand."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I think this justifies this fairly radically different translation.</p>
