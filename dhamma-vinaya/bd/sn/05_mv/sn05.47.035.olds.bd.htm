					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup><b><i>Dhamma.</i></b> This must either be 'things' (Bhk. Bodhi's phenomena will do.) or 'The Dhamma'. The term, as used in this connection, is defined clearly in terms of knowing the presence or absence in one and the arising, manifestation, and going home of several <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/thegreatmasterssatisfactionpastures.htm#dhamma">'Dhammas'</a> — categories of the Teaching: <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/highgetnhigh.htm#involvements">The Five Involvements,</a> <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualesson5.htm">The Five Stockpiles,</a> <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualesson6.htm">The Six Sense Realms</a>, <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualesson7.htm">The Seven Dimensions of Awakening</a>, <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/method/high_working_hypothesis.htm">The Four Aristocratic Truths</a>. So this instruction is either to live in 'things' viewing 'things' through the medium of these 'things', or, more satisfactorily, living in the Dhamma, one oversees the Dhamma through these Dhammas. Some people live completely absorbed in the material. They live in the body. Some people live completely absorbed in what they feel. They live in sensation. Some people live completely absorbed by their mental state. They live in the heart. Some people live completely absorbed by the Dhamma. They live in the Dhamma. In any case, that's how I see it. As for defining 'Dhamma' as 'The Buddha's Teaching' it might be better to think: 'The Objects of the Awakened Mind.'</p>
