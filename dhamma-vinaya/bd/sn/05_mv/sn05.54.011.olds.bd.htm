					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man, Icchānaṅgale revisiting,<br />
					Icchānaṅgala jungle grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man said this to the beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I wish, beggars, to retire to chambers for three months.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one should approach me<br />
					except the one who brings my mess-bowl food."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Bhante", the beggars responded in agreement<br />
					and subsequently no one approached the Lucky Man<br />
					except the one who brought his mess-bowl food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after the lapse of three months,<br />
					The Lucky Man emerged from his retirement chambers<br />
					and said this to the beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should wanderers of other views, beggars, question you thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In what manner, friends,<br />
					does the Shaman Gotama largely live<br />
					during the rains residency?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This being put to you, beggars,<br />
					by wanderers of other views,<br />
					this is how you should make response:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lucky Man, friends,<br />
					largely lives during the rains residency<br />
					serenely remembering his respiration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Breathing in deeply, I know:<br />
					'I am inspiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Breathing out deeply, I know:<br />
					'I am expiring deeply.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Breathing in shallowly, I know:<br />
					'I am inspiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Breathing out shallowly, I know:<br />
					'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />
					I breath in knowingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />

					<p class="f4">He, beggars, who speaking highly<br />
					would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the Aristocratic life,<br />

					highest answer-knowledge free,<br />
					even for such a one,<br />
					developing serene remembering of the respiration,<br />
					making a big thing of it,<br />
					is useful for living pleasantly in this seen thing<br />
