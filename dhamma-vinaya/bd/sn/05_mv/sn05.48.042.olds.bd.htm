					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a> revisiting<br />
					Eastern Park,<br />
					the mansion of <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/visakha_migaramata.htm">Migara's Mother.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There then Uṇṇābha the Brahmain approached the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached he drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings with the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					Uṇṇābha the Brahmain said this<br />
					to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five forces, good Gotama,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye-force,<br />
					the ear-force,<br />
					the nose-force,<br />
					the tongue-force,<br />
					the body-force.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five forces.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then good Gotama, of these five forces,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of their scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five forces, Brahmin,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye-force,<br />
					the ear-force,<br />
					the nose-force,<br />
					the tongue-force,<br />
					the body-force.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five forces.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then Brahmin, of these five forces,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage,<br />
					mind is the home,<br />
					and seated in mind<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama,<br />
					of mind,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of mind, Brahmin,<br />
					memory is the home,<br />
					and seated in memory<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama,<br />

					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of memory, Brahmin,<br />
					freedom is the home,<br />
					and seated in freedom<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama,<br />
					of freedom,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of freedom, Brahmin,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> is the home,<br />
					and seated in <i>Nibbāna</i><br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama,<br />
					of <i>Nibbāna,</i><br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what<br />
					is the bringing to life<br />
					of its scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Out of bounds, Brahmin,<br />
					is this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not to be had<br />
					is the encompassing of this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for plunging into <i>Nibbāna,</i> Brahmin,<br />
					that the godly life is lived<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> is its destination,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> is its culmination."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At that then, Brahmin Uṇṇābha<br />
					thrilled and rejoicing in the words of the Lucky Man,<br />
					rose from his seat and departed<br />
					keeping the Lucky Man to his right side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There then,<br />
					not long after the departure of the Brahmin Uṇṇābha,<br />
					the Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Given such as a house, beggars,<br />
					or a room in a house,<br />
					facing the newly risen sun at sunrise,<br />
					a window,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on what body would a sun-ray alight?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Upon the western wall, <i>Bhante</i>."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, beggars,<br />
					the Brahmin Uṇṇābha has lit upon<br />
					a faith in the <i>Tathāgata,</i><br />
					that has taken root,<br />
					strongly established itself,<br />
					not to be confused,<br />
					by shaman<br />
					or Brahmin<br />
					or god<br />
					or Devil<br />
					or Brahmā,<br />
					or anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should it come time for the Brahmin Uṇṇābha<br />
					to make an end, beggars,<br />
					there is no yoke to rebirth,<br />
					yoked to which yoke to rebirth<br />
					the Brahmin Uṇṇābha would come again to this world."</p>
