The Buddha instructs Uddabha the Brahmin that mind is the home of the five senses, and seated in mind is the bringing to life of the five senses scope and pasturage; memory is the home of mind, and seated in memory is the bringing to life of the mind's scope and pasturage; freedom is the home of memory, and seated in freedom is the bringing to life of memory's scope and pasturage; Nibbāna is the home of freedom, and seated in Nibbāna is the bringing to life of freedom's scope and pasturage; and that to ask about the home of Nibbāna is beyond the possibility of answering, and the scope and pasturage of Nibbāna is beyond encompassing." />

					Eastern Park,
					the mansion of <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/visakha_migaramata.htm">Migara's Mother</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Uṇṇābha the Brahmain approached the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached he drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings with the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Uṇṇābha the Brahmain said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five forces, good Gotama,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye-force,<br />
					the ear-force,<br />
					the nose-force,<br />
					the tongue-force,<br />
					the body-force.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five forces.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then good Gotama, of these five forces,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what is the bringing to life of their scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five forces, brahmin,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye-force,<br />
					the ear-force,<br />
					the nose-force,<br />
					the tongue-force,<br />
					the body-force.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five forces.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then brahmin, of these five forces,<br />
					diverse in scope,<br />
					diverse in pasturage,<br />
					not brought to life by one-another's scope or pasturage,<br />
					mind is the home,<br />
					and seated in mind is the bringing to life of their scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama, of mind,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of mind, brahmin,<br />
					memory is the home,<br />
					and seated in memory is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama, of memory,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of memory, brahmin,<br />
					freedom is the home,<br />
					and seated in freedom is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama, of freedom,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of freedom, brahmin,<br />
					Nibbāna is the home,<br />
					and seated in Nibbāna is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then further, good Gotama, of Nibbāna,<br />
					what is the home,<br />
					and seated in what is the bringing to life of it's scope and pasturage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Out of bounds, brahmin, is this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not to be had is the encompassing of this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for plunging into Nibbāna, brahmin,<br />
					that the godly life is lived<br />
					Nibbāna is it's destination,<br />
					Nibbāna is it's culmination.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At that then, brahmin Uṇṇābha thrilled and rejoycing in the words of the Lucky Man,<br />
					rose from his seat and departed keeping the Lucky Man to his right side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, not long after the departure of the brahmin Uṇṇābha,<br />
					the Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">Given such as a house, beggars,<br />
					or a room in a house,<br />
					facing the newly risen sun at sunrise,<br />
					a window,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on what body would a sun-ray alight?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Upon the western wall, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, beggars, the brahmin Uṇṇābha has lit upon a faith in the Tathāgata,<br />
					that has taken root,<br />
					strongly established itself,<br />
					not to be confused,||<br />
					by shaman<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or god<br />
					or Devil<br />
					or Brahma,<br />
					or anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should it come time for the brahmin Uṇṇābha to make an end, beggars,<br />
					there is no yoke to rebirth,<br />
					yoked to which yoke to rebirth<br />
					the brahmin Uṇṇābha would come again to this world."</p>
