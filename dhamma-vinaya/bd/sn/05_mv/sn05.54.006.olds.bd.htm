					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting, Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man addressed the Beggars there: "Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhadante!" the beggars responded to Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars! Do you develop recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">At this the Agéd One<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Ariṭṭha said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, Bhante, am one who develops recollecting aspiration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How then, Ariṭṭha, do you develop recollecting aspiration?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For that which has past, bhante, taking pleasure in the wished for has been let go.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the not yet come, taking pleasure in the wished for is put away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reaction to things inwardly and outwardly is well under control.</p>

					<p class="f4">So remembering I breath in, so remembering I breath out.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the way, bhante, I develop recollecting aspiration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Attained thus Ariṭṭha, is recollecting aspiration, not not attained, I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet Ariṭṭha, to get the full development of recollecting aspiration<br />
					give ear, pay good mind,<br />
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, bhante", said the Agéd One Ariṭṭha in response to Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagava said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Ariṭṭha, does one get fully developed recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here Ariṭṭha, a beggar<br />
					having gotten himself off to the forest<br />
					or to the root of some tree,<br />
					or to some empty hut,<br />
					and having taken up his seat there<br />
					sitting down,<br />
					setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					recollecting he attends to the mouth,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am inspiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out deeply, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires shallowly, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am inspiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he exspires shallowly, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Composing the heart,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Liberating the heart,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Liberating the heart,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for inconsistency,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for inconsistency,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for the end of lust,<br />

					makes for great fruit,<br />
					great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how, Ariṭṭha,<br />
