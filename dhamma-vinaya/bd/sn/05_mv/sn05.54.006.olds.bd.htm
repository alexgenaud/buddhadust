					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting, Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man addressed the Beggars there: "Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhadante!" the beggars responded to Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars! Do you develop recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">At this the Agéd One<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Ariṭṭha said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">I, Bhante, am one who develops recollecting aspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then, Ariṭṭha, do you develop recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">For that which has past, bhante, taking pleasure in the wished for has been let go;<br />
					For the not yet come, taking pleasure in the wished for is put away;<br />
					Reaction to things inwardly and outwardly is well under control.<br />
					So remembering I breath in, so remembering I breath out,<br />
					This is the way, bhante, I develop recollecting aspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Attained thus Ariṭṭha, is recollecting aspiration, not not attained, I say<br />
					Yet Ariṭṭha, to get the full development of recollecting aspiration<br />
					give ear, pay good mind,<br />
					I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, bhante, said the Agéd One Ariṭṭha in response to Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagava said this:<br />
					And how, Ariṭṭha, does one get fully developed recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here Ariṭṭha, a beggar having gotten himself off to the forest or to the root of some tree, or to some empty hut, and having taken up his seat there sitting down, setting the body upright, legs bent-across-lapwise, recollecting he attends to the face, just so he recollects inspiration, just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring deeply.'<br />
					If he breaths out deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring shallowly.'<br />
					If he exspires shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pacifying own-body-making,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Pacifying own-body-making,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on enthusiasm,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Reflecting on enthusiasm,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Observing pleasure,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Observing pleasure,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Abundantly content in heart,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Abundantly content in heart,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Composing the heart,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Composing the heart,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Liberating the heart,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'Liberating the heart,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for inconsistency,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'On the look-out for inconsistency,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for the end of lust,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'On the look-out for the end of lust,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for ending,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'On the look-out for ending,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for opportunities to let go,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.<br />
					'On the look-out for opportunities to let go,<br />
					I will expire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suchwise 'developed', Ariṭṭha, suchwise 'made much of' recollecting aspiration makes for great fruit, great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how, Ariṭṭha, one gets fully developed recollecting aspiration.</p>
