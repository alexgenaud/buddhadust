					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There then a congregation of bhikkhus approached The Lucky Man and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near Bhagava and giving salutation they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, those beggars said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, then, bhante, is power?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the path to power?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the development of the power-paths?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the path going to the development of the power paths?"</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Here beggars, a beggar experiences not just one of the various sorts of power:</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one he also becomes many,<br />
					being many he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here, transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand the Moon and Sun, as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body even in the Brahma world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is what is called 'power'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And what, beggars, is the path to power?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever way, beggars, whatever path-tracking results in gaining power, gaining power acquisition —</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is called 'the path to power'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And what, beggars, is the development of the power-paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is what is called 'the development of the power-paths.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And what, beggars, is the path going to the development of the power-paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this very Aristocratic Eight-dimensional Way, that is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">High view,<br />
					high principles,<br />
					high talk,<br />
					high works,<br />
					high lifestyle,<br />
					high self-control,<br />
					high memory,<br />
					high serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is what is called 'the path going to the development of the power-paths'".</p>
