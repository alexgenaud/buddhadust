					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Bhagava,<br />
               Baranasi-town,<br />
               Deer Park,<br />
               <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#Isipatana">Isipatana</a> came a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There to The Group of Five Beggars<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
               he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Two, me bhikkhus,<br />
               are ends<br />
					not to be gone after<br />
					by one embarking on the seeker's life.</p>

					<p class="f4">What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">At the one end:<br />
					whatever is desire,<br />
					is yoked to desire for the sweet-life,<br />
					inferior,<br />
					peasant-like,<br />
					of the common man,<br />
					not aristocratic,<br />
					destitute of character.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at the other end:<br />
					whatever is yoked to causing self-torment,<br />
					is painful,<br />
					not aristocratic,<br />
					destitute of character.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by not attacking<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> either end, beggars,<br />
					that the <i>Tathāgata</i> woke up<br />
					to a way to go down the middle;<br />
					eye-opening,<br />
					instructive,<br />
					smoothing the way<br />
					to higher knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars,<br />
					is that way<br />
					to go down the middle<br />
					awakened to by the <i>Tathāgata;</i><br />
					eye-opening,<br />
					instructive,<br />
					smoothing the way<br />
					to higher knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It is this aristocratic<br />
					multi-dimensional<br />
					high way:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">High view,<br />
					consummate principles,<br />
					consummate talk,<br />
					consummate works,<br />
					consummate lifestyle,<br />
					high reign,<br />
					consummate mind, and<br />
					consummate serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars, is that way<br />
					to go down the middle<br />
					awakened to by the <i>Tathāgata;</i><br />
					eye-opening,<br />
					instructive,<br />
					smoothing the way<br />
					to higher knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here then, beggars,<br />
					this is the aristocrat<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> of truths<br />
					with regard to pain:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Birth is pain,<br />
					aging is pain,<br />
					sickness is pain,<br />
					death is pain;<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair are pain;<br />
					being yoked to the unloved is pain,<br />
					being separated from the loved is pain.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Not getting the desirable,<br />
					that too is pain.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">To be concise:<br />
					the five stockpiles binding up individuality<br />
					are pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars,<br />
					is the aristocrat of truths<br />
					with regard to the origin of pain:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in whatever thirst<br />
					results in living;<br />
					delight;<br />
					lust for getting;<br />
					seeking delight<br />
					now here now there.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as well to say it is:<br />
					thirst for pleasures,<br />
					thirst for living,<br />
					thirst for escape.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars,<br />
					is the aristocrat of truths<br />
					with regard to the end of pain:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in the passing out,<br />
					the rejection,<br />
					the doing away with,<br />
					the ending with nothing remaining<br />
					of that lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggars,<br />
					is the aristocrat of truths<br />
					with regard to the way<br />
					to get to the end of pain:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this aristocratic eight-dimensional high way:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">High view,<br />
					consummate principles,<br />
					consummate works,<br />
					consummate lifestyle,<br />
					high reign,<br />
					consummate mind, and<br />
					consummate serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Beggars, just as soon<br />

					four-quartered<br />
					aristocrat of truths,<br />
					I did declare in this world<br />

					the highest self-awakening<br />

					<p class="f4">Knowledge had arisen in me,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Unshakable is the release of my heart!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the end of birth!</p>

					<p class="f4">Further living has been cut off!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That's what the Bhagava said.</p>

					<p class="f4">And uplifted in mind<br />
					by the Bhagava's words<br />
					the Group of Five Bhikkhus<br />
					were greatly delighted<br />
					and it happened during this exposition<br />
					that in the Ancient Koṅdañña<br />
					there sprang up the untarnished,<br />
					unmuddied <i>Dhamma</i> eye<br />
					that sees:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever thing has a beginning,<br />
					that also is a thing that ends."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Kondañña, Vappa, Bhaddiya, Mahānāma, and Assaji. "When the group of five ascetics saw the Blessed One at a distance coming towards them, they made an agreement amongst themselves saying, "Friends, here comes the monk Gotama who had become self-indulgent, given up the struggle and gone back to a life of luxury; let us not pay homage to him nor go to greet him and relieve him of his bowl and robes." from Arrival At Isipatana The Great Discourse On The Wheel Of Dhamma, Mahasi Sayadaw</p>

					<p class="ctr"><img src="../../../../resources/images/grp_of_5.gif" width="488" height="386" alt="But the Group of 5 was unable to remain seated as Gotama Approached."></p>
					<p class="f1 ctr"><b>From the story of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/idx_first_sutta_resources.htm">First Sutta</a>.</b></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Taking <i>anupakamma</i> to be <i>anupakama:</i> Using, I presume, <i>"anupakamma",</i> Bhk. Bodhi translates "veering"; Bhk. Nanamoli, Bhk. Thanissaro, and Bhk Piyadassi all translate "avoids" or "avoiding"; Bhk. Saydow uses a manuscript with <i>"anupagamma"</i> and translates "avoiding" where at least to my eye the translation makes sense. What I am hearing as being said is addressing the issue of what it was that Gotama and the Group of 5 set out to do in the first place, which was to conquer the problem of existence or <i>Dukkha</i> (they saw the two problems as the same when starting out). He approaches them knowing their mind concerning his so called lapse into self-indulgence, so he immediately launches into an explanation that shows them how all their thinking was wrong. So what I hear him saying is that you do not 'attack the problem' from either of these two ends — either by ignoring it by indulging in sense pleasures or by attempting to atone for whatever it is that went wrong to cause all this pain by inflicting suffering on the self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Ariyasaccaṃ:</i> others have Aryan, most often seen as "Noble" I usually use Aristocratic as here, but was tempted to suggest that what we should be hearing is the very deep roots of the word: <i>a</i> = to re = the sun ya = whatever; all around, complete, encompassing, full "The Truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> This takes liberties with the <i>Pāḷi.</i> In the <i>Pāḷi</i> the sequence would have the listener abandon the second truth where what should be being abandoned is the subject of the truth: <i>tanha.</i> To my eye it looks like this is the case in all four cases, but the first, third and fourth are of such a nature as can be read either way. I suspect that the original was considerably more expanded and dealt with each truth in each of the four manners: thorough and precise understanding, seeing the truth of it, living it, and abandoning it ... in that order. And that is how I have constructed my translation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The <i>Pāḷi</i> text has here two additional paragraphs which are not attributed to the Buddha by the speaker, nor is there an indication that the speaker is speaking for himself. This material, has to do with the reaction of the gods to the conclusion of this sutta and at its success in having brought Koṅdañña to the state of being a Streamwinner. The interested reader can find this in the versions of other translators.</p>
