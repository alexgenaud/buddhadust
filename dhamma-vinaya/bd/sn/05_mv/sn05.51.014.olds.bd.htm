					Migara's Mother's Palace<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Additionally there were there then<br />
					a great many beggars<br />
					on the lower floor of Migara's Mother's Palace<br />

					<p class="f4">"These of the Brahmā life, Moggallāna,<br />
					living on the lower floor<br />
					of Migara's Mother's Palace<br />
					unstable,<br />
					hollow,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante</i>," the Elder Maha-Moggallāna said to <i>Bhagava</i> in response.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so,<br />
					super-conjuring<br />

					<p class="f4">Standing outside together<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> there then<br />

					disproported,<br />
					discomported."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lucky Man drew near to those beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near those beggars,<br />
					he said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is it, beggars,<br />
					that you stand outside together,<br />
					filled with fear,<br />
					hair standing on end?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"A work of sorcery has occurred, <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">An abnormality, <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Sheltered from the wind<br />

					discomported."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is so, beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">A working up of self-concern in you, beggars,<br />
					has been worked by Moggallāna —<br />
					contorting,<br />
					disproporting,<br />
					discomporting<br />
					Migara's Mother's Palace,<br />
					with his big toe.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is it, do you think, beggars,<br />
					that was developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by <i>bhikkhu</i> Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being<br />
					of such great power?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					things are best resorted to<br />
					rooted in the Lucky Man,<br />
					channeled through <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					if further explanation of this point<br />
					were given by the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is said by the Lucky Man<br />
					will be held in memory by the beggars."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Listen up then, beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">Four, beggars,<br />
					are the power-paths<br />
					that were developed,<br />
					made a big thing of<br />
					by <i>bhikkhu</i> Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being<br />
					of such great power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, the <i>bhikkhu</i> Moggallano<br />
					develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />

					<p class="f4">These then, beggars,<br />
					are the four power-paths<br />
					that were developed,<br />
					made a big thing of<br />
					by <i>bhikkhu</i> Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being<br />
					of such great power.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the beggar Moggallāna<br />
					experiences not just one<br />
					of the various sorts of power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one he also becomes many,<br />
					being many he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here,<br />
					transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever<br />
					as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged<br />
					like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand<br />
					the Moon and Sun,<br />
					as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body<br />
					even in the Brahmā world.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the beggar Moggallāna<br />
					with purified godlike hearing,<br />
					beyond that of ordinary men,<br />
					hears both sounds:<br />
					godly and man-made,<br />
					far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the beggar Moggallāna —<br />
					of other beings,<br />
					of other men,<br />
					heart encompassing heart,<br />
					he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a lustful heart:<br />
					'This is a lustful heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a lust-free heart:<br />
					'This is a lust-free heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a hateful heart:<br />
					'This is a hateful heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a hate-free heart:<br />
					'This is a hate-free heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a clogged up heart:<br />
					'This is a clogged up heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an unclogged heart:<br />
					'This is an unclogged heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an deranged heart:<br />
					'This is a deranged heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a balanced heart:<br />
					'This is a balanced heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a constricted heart:<br />
					'This is a constricted heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an unconstricted heart:<br />
					'This is an unconstricted heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a state of heart<br />
					that is less than superior:<br />
					'This is a state of heart<br />
					that is less than superior.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a state of heart<br />
					that is superior:<br />
					'This state of heart<br />
					is nothing less than superior.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of useless heart:<br />
					'This is a useless heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a beneficial heart:<br />
					'This is a beneficial heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a heart that is not free:<br />
					'This is a heart that is not free."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a heart that is freed:<br />
					'This is a heart that is freed."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the beggar Moggallāna<br />
					recollects not just one arrangement<br />
					of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">For example:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just one birth,<br />
					just two births,<br />
					just three births,<br />
					just four births,<br />
					just five births,<br />
					just ten births,<br />
					just twenty births,<br />
					just thirty births,<br />
					just forty births,<br />
					just fifty births,<br />
					one hundred births in all,<br />
					a thousand births in all,<br />
					a hundred-thousand births in all,<br />
					not just one evolution of a kappa,<br />
					not just one devolution of a kappa,<br />
					not just one evolution and devolution of a kappa.</p>

					<p class="f4">That there he was:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a name<br />
					of such a clan<br />
					of such color<br />
					of such food<br />
					of such experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					of such coming to life's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that, re-appearing elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was in that habitation:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a name<br />
					of such a clan<br />
					of such color<br />
					of such food<br />
					of such experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					of such coming to life's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that he was reborn here."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with its makeup in detail,<br />
					he recollects not just one arrangement<br />
					of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the beggar Moggallāna<br />
					sees beings<br />
					with purified godlike sight<br />
					surpassing that of mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows of beings<br />
					their	shifting away,<br />
					re-appearance,<br />
					being left behind,<br />
					advancing,<br />
					their beauty,<br />
					their ugliness,<br />
					their experiencing of pleasure,<br />
					experiencing of pain,<br />
					according to their intentional deeds:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For sure these good beings were<br />
					committed to injurious bodily conduct,<br />
					committed to injurious verbal conduct,<br />
					committed to injurious mental conduct,<br />
					denigrated Aristocrats,<br />
					held low views,<br />
					were committed to behavior<br />
					in accordance with low views,<br />
					for upon the break up of the body after death<br />
					they have arisen in states of woe,<br />
					pain,<br />
					punishment,<br />
					<i>Niraya</i> Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">For sure these good beings were<br />
					committed to beneficial bodily conduct,<br />
					committed to beneficial verbal conduct,<br />
					committed to beneficial mental conduct,<br />
					spoke well of Aristocrats,<br />
					were of consummate view,<br />
					were committed to behavior<br />
					in accordance with consummate view,<br />
					for upon the break up of the body after death<br />
					they have arisen in worlds of heavenly pleasures.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he sees beings<br />
					with purified godlike sight<br />
					surpassing that of mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows of beings<br />
					their	shifting away,<br />
					re-appearance,<br />
					being left behind,<br />
					advancing,<br />
					their beauty,<br />
					their ugliness,<br />
					their experiencing of pleasure,<br />

					<p class="f4">And further, beggars,<br />
					it is because he has thus developed,<br />
					thus made a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that through his own higher knowledge<br />
					bhikkhu Moggallāna experienced<br />
					the destruction of the corrupting influences,<br />
					and without corrupting influences,<br />

A recent archeological dig claims to have found the foundations of this house, so it appears it was not on stilts. This is also supported by the statement of the <i>bhikkhus</i> in this sutta that the house was built on a deeply placed foundation. That, however is not conclusive as there are stories at the time of houses being built on large pillars placed deeply in the ground. The story is that it was multi-leveled and was completely covered in precious cloth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Uddhatā unna'ā capalā mukharā vikiṇṇavācā muṭṭha-s-satino asampajānā asamāhitā vibbh'antacittā pākat'indriyā.</i> Make up your own list. Woodward has: 'frivolous, empty-headed, busybodies, of harsh speech, loose in talk, lacking concentration, unsteady, not composed, of flighty minds, with senses uncontrolled;' <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has: 'restless, puffed up, personally vain, rough-tongued, rambling in their talk, muddle-minded, without clear comprehension, unconcentrated, scatter-brained, loose in their faculties.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Saṇvejehī.</i> Woodward: 'a good stirring!' <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: 'stir up a sense of urgency.' The whole sentence: <i>Gaccha Moggallāna, te bhikkhu saṇvejehī.</i> "Go Moggallāna, these beggars <i>saṇvejehī.</i>" PED has to agitate, move, or stir. I think this goes to <i>saṃ + vindati,</i> self-knowledge or self-awareness, or self-seeing. We would say: 'Teach' or, in the recent past here: 'Learn these beggars some self-concern."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Saṇkampesi, sampakampesi, sampacālesi.</i> Con-tremble shake quiver tremble, com-re-all-arouna-tremble ..., com-re-all-arouna-quake.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Ekam antaṃ.</i> Inconsistent with the usual 'to one side' but still, I believe, a fair translation. I see them huddled together having fled the house.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The text skips what is here § 11-14, and numbers what is here § 15 as § 11, and states, <i>after</i> that: The Six Higher Powers are to be dealt with in the same way. This would put them out of the usual and more logical and instructive order that is found in <a href="sn05.51.011.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.51.11</a>, and which has been used here.</p>
