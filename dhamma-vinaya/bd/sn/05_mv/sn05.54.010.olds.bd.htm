					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava,<br />
					Kimbila-district,<br />
					Bamboo Grove came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Bhagava said this to the Agéd One, Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">How developed, Kimbila,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration-highgetting,<br />
					how made a big thing of,<br />
					having great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoken to, the Agéd One, Kimbila remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time The Lucky Man said this to the Agéd One, Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">How developed, Kimbila,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration-highgetting,<br />
					how made a big thing of,<br />
					having great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Agéd One, Kimbila remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time The Lucky Man said this to the Agéd One, Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">How developed, Kimbila,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration-highgetting,<br />
					how made a big thing of,<br />
					having great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Agéd One, Kimbila remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, this having been said,<br />
					the Agéd One, Ānanda, said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the time, Bhagava!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the time, Welcome One,<br />
					for the Bhagava to relate the recollecting aspiration-highgetting.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Beggars will remember what is heard from the Bhagava."</p>

					<p class="f4">In that case, Ānanda,<br />
					listen up,<br />
					pay attention,<br />
					I will speak!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Bhante! replied the Agéd One, Ānanda to Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">And how 'developed', Ānanda,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">How 'made much of',<br />
					suchas makes for great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here Ānanda, a beggar having gotten himself off to the forest<br />
					or to the root of some tree,<br />
					or to some empty hut,<br />
					and having taken up his seat there<br />
					sitting down, setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					recollecting<br />
					he attends to the area around the mouth,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he exspires shallowly, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring shallowly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reflecting on the totality of bodily experience,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Liberating the heart,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
					this is the way he trains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Liberating the heart,<br />

					<p class="f4">'On the look-out for inconsistency,<br />
					I will inspire,'<br />
