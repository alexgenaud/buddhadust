					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					Kimbila-district,<br />
					Bamboo Grove came-a revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There <i>Bhagava</i> said this to the Agéd One, Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How developed, Kimbila,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration-serenity,<br />
					how made a big thing of,<br />
					having great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoken to, the Agéd One, Kimbila remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time The Lucky Man said this to the Agéd One, Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How developed, Kimbila,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration-serenity,<br />
					how made a big thing of,<br />
					having great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Agéd One, Kimbila remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time The Lucky Man said this to the Agéd One, Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How developed, Kimbila,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration-serenity,<br />
					how made a big thing of,<br />
					having great fruit,<br />
					great benefit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Agéd One, Kimbila remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, this having been said,<br />
					the Agéd One, Ānanda, said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the time, <i>Bhagava!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the time, Welcome One,<br />
					for the <i>Bhagava</i> to relate the recollecting aspiration-serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Beggars will remember what is heard from the <i>Bhagava.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Ānanda,<br />
					listen up,<br />
					pay attention,<br />
					I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante!</i>" replied the Agéd One, Ānanda to <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Bhagava</i> said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how 'developed', Ānanda,<br />
					is recollecting aspiration?</p>

					<p class="f4">How 'made much of',<br />
					such as makes for great fruit,<br />
