					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Elder Ānanda, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a> residing, Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There then the brahmin <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/unnabha.htm">Uṇṇābha</a> approached the Elder Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near the Elder Ānanda<br />
					he exchanged with him friendly greetings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged friendly greetings<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					the brahmin Uṇṇābha said this to the Elder Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. For what purpose then, good Ānanda,<br />
					does the shaman Gotama teach the Godly life?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is for the letting go of wishing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, brahmin,<br />
					that the Lucky Man teaches the Godly life.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Is there then, good Ānanda,<br />
					a way, a path to follow<br />
					to attain the letting go of wishing?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brahmin,<br />
					such a way, such a path to follow<br />
					to attain the letting go of wishing.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. What then, good Ānanda,<br />
					is that way, that path to follow<br />
					to attain the letting go of wishing?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Here brahmin, a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is that way,<br />
					this is that path to follow<br />
					to attain the letting go of wishing.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Such being the case, Ānanda,<br />
					then this is an ending having no ending<br />
					for to say that wishing could by wishing be dropped<br />
					is not a wise position.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then brahmin,<br />
					I will put questions to you about this —<br />
					as you see fit,<br />
					so you should make response.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. What think you, brahmin,<br />
					earlier was there wishing involved at the thought:<br />
					'I will go to the park'?<br />
					And then later, after having got to the park,<br />
					was not that wish desolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it was, goodman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Earlier was there energy involved at the thought:<br />
					'I will go to the park'?<br />
					And then later, after having got to the park,<br />
					was not that energy desolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it was, goodman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Earlier was there heart for it involved at the thought:<br />
					'I will go to the park'?<br />
					And then later, after having got to the park,<br />
					was not that heart desolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it was, goodman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Earlier was there investigation involved at the thought:<br />
					'I will go to the park'?<br />
					And then later, after having got to the park,<br />
					was not that investigating desolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it was, goodman.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">8. Even such is the case, brahmin,<br />
					of that Arahant who has destroyed the corrupting influences,<br />
					who is un-ocupied,<br />
					duty's doing done,<br />
					load laid down,<br />
					his own good gained,<br />
					yokes to living thoroughly broken,<br />
					by highest answer-knowledge freed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That earlier wish he had for the attaining of arahantship;<br />
					after attaining arahantship,<br />
					that wish was desolved.</p>

					<p class="f4">That earlier energy he had for the attaining of arahantship;<br />
					after attaining arahantship,<br />
					that energy was desolved.</p>

					<p class="f4">That earlier heart for it he had for the attaining of arahantship;<br />
					after attaining arahanthip,<br />
					that heart for it was desolved.</p>

					<p class="f4">That earlier investigaing he did for the attaining of arahanthips;<br />
					after attaining arahantship,<br />
					that investigating was desolved.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. So then what think you, brahmin,<br />
					such being the case,<br />
					is this an ending having an ending or no?</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed goodman Ānanda,<br />
					such is an ending having an ending not no ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Superbly done, good Ānanda!<br />
					Superbly done, good Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as though, good Ānanda,<br />
					that which was upside-down were set right-side up,<br />
					the covered were uncovered,<br />
					the lost were told the way,<br />
					an oil-lamp were brought into the darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes in their heads could see shapes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus thusly the Elder Ānanda has shown Dhamma with not simply one exposition.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to Gotama for refuge<br />
					and to the Dhamma<br />
					and to the Order of Beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having been given life this day,<br />
					remember me, Venerable Ānanda<br />
					as a follower who has taken refuge.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Chando.</i> Wishing, desire, wanting, including wanting sense pleasures, wanting to avoid pain, even wanting to do good. A synonym for <i>taṇhā,</i> hungar/thirst. The source of Pain. Knowledge of this is the knowledge of the Second Truth of the Magga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This statement again says that in effect the four power-paths are the equivalent of the Aristocratic Multi-Dimensional Way. See: SN <a href="sn05.51.002.olds.bd.htm">5.51.2</a> for a similar statement.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This whole sequence is awkward in English. Was there desire involved in the thought you had of going to the park? Was there energy involved in doing it? Was there the will or intent to do it? There is a distinction made in this system between the wish to do a thing and the will or intent to do it. You can want to eat a huge meal but knowing the consequences in heartburn (so to speak), you can have no will to do it. And was there know-how involved? Piecing together in mind the steps needed to be taken to accomplsh the deed.</p>
