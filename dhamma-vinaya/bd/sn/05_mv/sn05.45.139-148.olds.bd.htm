					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Anusāri.</i> PED: "a kind of dark, fragrant sandal wood" Vin. Texts II.51; Vin I.203; S III.156 = V.44 =  A V.22. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi translates 'orris'. Which OED describes:  The rhizome of three species of Iris (I. <i>florentina,</i> I. <i>germanica,</i> I. <i>pallida</i>), which has a fragrant odor like that of violets; it is used powdered as a perfume and in medicine. Orris-root oil, oil of orris-root, a crystalline oil of pearly lustre obtained from orris-root; also, in commerce, a solid crystallizable substance distilled from orris-root. In the next section the term used and translated as sandalwood is <i>candana.</i> I have personally used black sandalwood and it is definitely considered the tops.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Kuṭṭarājāno.</i> Both Woodward and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi translate 'petty princes' which is the term in common use. Alternatively Woodward suggests the reading <i>'kuḍḍa'</i> and translates: 'wattle-and-daub king'. Here there seems little sense in be-littling the kings involved as the greater their stature, the greater the stature of the Wheel-turning King and the greater the stature of the Wheel-turning king, the greater stature implied for the importance of not being careless. Someone's politics may have been involved in the editing here. A Wheel-turning King is really what we understand to be an Emperor, a King of Kings.</p>
