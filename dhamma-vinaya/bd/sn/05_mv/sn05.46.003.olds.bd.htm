					<p class="f4">4. How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Listening to such beggars, beggars,<br />
					Dhamma is made manifest<br />
					to one living in solitude<br />
					in two forms of solitude:<br />
					solitude in body, and<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Antarāparinibbāyī.</i> As defined in the footnotes of the PTS translations, in PED and in Cohen's NPD, this is a technical term which means a non-returner who, after death and after rebirth in some unspecified heaven reaches thorough coolness before the end or around the mid-point of that life. I have checked <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.33.05.pali.bd.htm#p5.18">DN 3. XXXIII,</a> PTS trans, pg 227: 'one who passes away before middle age in that world in which he has been reborn' (but the Pali does not contain anything like 'in that world in which he has been reborn'. [Follow above link to see for yourself.] I have also checked out the other references given in footnotes and the dictionaries and in every case what is happening is that a definition/translation is being given to this term that is not to be found in the Suttas (that is, it is likely being taken from commentary). By itself, which is what I believe the proper method in this case would indicate, the translation is: midway-allround-cool(er) or beteen-allaround-cool(er) or if you want to go to 'Old Pali': End-around-allaround-cooler or fore-around-allaround-cooler. In the list of non-returners in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p16">AN 7 16</a> which is the same as in this sutta and in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.33.05.olds.bd.htm#p5.18">DN 33</a> and in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p52">AN 7.52</a>, this person is the first in the descending-in-accomplishment group found here and each term of which is similarly translated with reference to information outside the suttas. The possibilities are that this is in fact reference to reaching the cool mid-term of the next life, or, looking at the last term, which speaks of rebirth in the Akaniṭṭha Realm, a Pure Abode, which is a destination exclusively for Non-returners where all persons born there attain the cool mid-way through the given lifespan there and thinking 'hum ... this looks like the last person is experiencing the same destiny as the first,' concluding that what may be being spoken of is 'midway between the death in this body and the next rebirth.' This is, of course, a point which raises a hulla-balloo in some circles. I don't see any problem with the idea that there is a period of time which varies for different individuals between say 'formal rebirths' and simply traveling around disembodied such as in a dream and that what is being spoken of in this series is the length of that period — the endpoint of which period for the non-returner if he had not got free earler would be rebirth in the Akaniṭṭha realm. I am translating the terms as found, leaving the meaning ambiguous. I do not recall a case where a technical term not obvious from the formation of the term itself is not defined within the suttas. Remember! The list is in descending order of skill, so each subsequent term is describing a person with more holding on than the one before.<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Upahacca-parinibbāyī.</i> Presumably at some point past the mid-point between death and the next life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Asaŋkhāra-parinibbāyī.</i> Presumably at some pont past death and the next life without the experience of having to deal with any identified-with phenomena. I am not sure I see a distinction between this one and the previous two, but elsewhere there is description of this situation as being 'without much trouble', and the next as 'with some trouble', so perhaps it is a matter of the difficulty of coping with the temptation to be.</p>
