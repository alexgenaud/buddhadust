					<p class="lgqt">Sorting through the confusion here, it appears that what is influencing Woodward's translation is whether or not <i>satipaṭṭhānā,</i> 'setting up mind' is the same thing as <i>sati,</i> 'mind' and whether or not having set up 'mind' is the same thing as having attained <i>upekkha,</i> objective detachment, liberation.<br />
					The position here takes it's clue from the use in the Way where the term for the seventh step is <i>'sammā sati'</i> not <i>'sammā satipaṭṭhānā'</i>. Setting up mind is not the same thing as having set up mind. The first is the practice for the attaining of the second. This is a matter of terminology only.<br />
					Setting up mind, <i>satipaṭṭhānā,</i> incorporates by the inclusion of the Four Truths as part of what is to be set up The Eight Dimensional Way and by that <i>'sammā sati'</i>.
					The set up mind <i>sammā sati,</i> is described as having attained to being 'not downbound to anything at all in the world', the equivalent of being objectively detached.<br />
					Setting up mind describes the process of setting up mind, having set up mind describes the state of the set up mind, the Way describes the various states of the set up mind.<br />
					The <i>term</i> <i>Satipaṭṭhānā,</i> because it includes methodologies for the beginner (settings-up, trainings) that are not found in the set up mind, can only be used as a description of a method, it is one-sided in that respect.<br />
					The <i>terms</i> <i>'Sammā sati'</i> and the other steps of The Way may be used in the beginning and middle for describing tools, 'methods,' when they are used as ways to form behavior and judge progress in the attaining of the states described, at the end for describing the attained state. They serve both ends.<br />
					As high as the praise is for the four <i>satipaṭṭhānā</i> Gotama never states that they are anything more than the means to the end. They are the 'one sure way' to the Deathless, not a description of the Deathless itself.<br />
					On the other hand there is no call either to read this passage as anything other than an exhortation to get busy. Woodward seems to have been distracted by the debate.</p>

					<p class="f2 lgqt"><sup>[<a id="sn1" href="#sfn1">sub 1</a>]</sup> The controversy arises not from this passage, but from the first lines of the following sutta [<a href="sn05.47.042.olds.bd.htm">SN 5 47 42</a>] which is translated by Woodward: 'Monks, I will teach you both the arising and the ending of the four stations of mindfulness.'<br />
