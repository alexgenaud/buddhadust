					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This is another of those 'mind-twistu' wheel suttas. It is hard for us to think that this would have been given out as presented on one single occasion, but that is more than likely. The idea is to force concentration by the need to keep awake to keep track of a complex series of changes embedded in a mind-numbing repititition where the effect is actually to engrave on the mind the repeated segments. They are the real lesson. That advantage would be lost if the suttas were delivered singly over many days.</p>

					<p>This is the final set of suttas of the Saṃyutta Nikāya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Translating the exact wording of this sutta from the <i>Pāḷi</i> beats me. The simile is of a big thing compared to a tiny thing. The words in the <i>Pāḷi</i> for the numbers of beings reborn this way and that are 'big' and 'little'. The word 'number' doesn't come in. So trying to be precise we get constructions like: little are the beings reborn ... big are the beings reborn which I doubt is the intended meaning. The other translators have resorted to 'few' and 'many'. My translation is just another variation and is not to be understood as making any claim to greater accuracy. I have tried to make the simile match its counterpart. This same set of instructions is given elsewhere with the more fitting grain of sand on the fingernail compared to the grains of sand on the banks of the Ganges.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Adiṭṭha.</i> Not-seeing. Make no mistake this does not mean 'not having come into contact with' or 'not understanding' in the intellectual sense. <i>Ditthi</i> is the <i>Pāḷi</i> for 'working hypothesis' or 'theory' or intellectually understood point of view; <i>dittha</i> is having 'seen' a thing as it really is, having seen how it works in reality, having seen the truth of a <i>ditthi</i> through actual experience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> See the introduction to <a href="sn05.56.020.olds.bd.htm">SN 5.56.20</a> Olds translation. These are not the Four Aristocratic Truths themselves; these are statements pointing to those truths.</p>
