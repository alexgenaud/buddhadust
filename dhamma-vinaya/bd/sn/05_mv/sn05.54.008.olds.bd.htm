					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:<br />

					<p class="f4">Suchwise 'developed', beggars, suchwise 'made much of' recollecting aspiration high-getting makes for great fruit, great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too beggars, before my awakening, not yet awakened, a bodhisattva, used to live in this same way, making much of this way of living.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I lived this way, bhikkhus, making much of this way of living,<br />
					there was neither bodily fatigue nor eyestrain<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and through not getting involved, my heart was freed from the corruptions.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There shall be neither bodily fatigue nor eyestrain for me<br />
					and through not getting involved,<br />
					my heart will be freed from the corruptions,"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let go shall be the rememberings and principles associated with household life."</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall live perceiving the disadvantageous in the advantageous"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall live perceiving the advantageous in the disadvantageous"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, while still rethinking, while still reminiscing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>,<br />

					that solitude-born pleasant enthusiasm<br />
					separate from sense pleasures,<br />
					separate from unskillful things"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, subduing rethinking and reminiscing,<br />
					enter into and live in the attainment of the second 'knowing',<br />
					that internal happiness,<br />
					that unified state of mind<br />

					without reminiscing,<br />

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, with the phasing out of enthusiasm,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Detached, recollected, he lives happily.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					without pleasure,<br />
					in the all-round purity of the detached mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, with the surpassing of all perception of shapes,<br />
					with the resolution of perception of reaction,<br />
					not paying attention to perception of diversity,<br />
					thinking:<br />
					'Without end is Space,'<br />
					enter into and live in the Sphere of Space"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, with the surpassing of all perception of the Sphere of Space,<br />

					'Without end is Consciousness,'<br />
					enter into and live in the Sphere of Consciousness"</p>

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, with the surpassing of the Sphere of Consciousness,<br />

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore beggars, if a beggar would determine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall, with the surpassing of the Sphere of Nothing to be Had,<br />

					<p class="f4">it would be well to keep in mind this remembering the respiration serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this remembering the respiration serenity is thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					if there is the experience of a pleasant sensation,<br />
					it is known as: 'Inconsistent,'<br />
					it is known as: 'Don't get involved with it,'<br />
					it is known as: 'Don't get worked up about it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing an unpleasant sensation,<br />
					it is known as: 'Inconsistent,'<br />
					it is known as: 'Don't get involved with it,'<br />
					it is known as: 'Don't get worked up about it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Experiencing a sensation which is not unpleasant but not pleasant,<br />
					it is known as: 'Inconsistent,'<br />
					it is known as: 'Don't get involved with it,'<br />
					it is known as: 'Don't get worked up about it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If a pleasant sensation is experienced,<br />
					it is experienced without bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If an unpleasant sensation is experienced,<br />
					it is experienced without bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a sensation which is not unpleasant but not pleasant is experienced,<br />
					it is experienced without bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is the experience of the sense that the body is reaching it's end,<br />
					he knows: 'I am experiencing the sense that the body is reaching it's end.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is the experience of the sense that life is reaching it's end,<br />
					he knows: 'I am experiencing the sense that life is reaching it's end.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows: "At the break-up of the body<br />
					as life reaches it's end,<br />
					even here,<br />
					not getting worked up about any sensation,<br />
					one can become cool.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					as an oil-lamp burns because of oil<br />
					and because of a wick,<br />
					but with the consumption of it's fuel,<br />
					with the drying up of the oil and the wick,<br />
					it goes out,<br />
					even so, beggars,<br />
					a beggar experiencing the sense that the body is reaching it's end,<br />
					knows: 'I am experiencing the sense that the body is reaching it's end,'<br />
					experiencing the sense that life is reaching it's end,<br />
					knows: 'I am experiencing the sense that life is reaching it's end',</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows: "At the break-up of the body<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>  Ākankheyya. Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi and others see this as a matter of wishing/wanting. I suggest that this is not something subject to doubt (kanka), that is, it is the perception of technique made possible by the sharpness of mind developed in the practice of recollecting aspiration. It is not a 'wish' or 'desire' or simply a thought or plan (where there is doubt as to the outcome)...it is no more a matter of 'wishing' than is making a choice between two paths, one which leads to one's destination and the other which does not. The meaning is 'intend' in the sense used by Castenada's Don Juan. It is a combination of the 'will' and the 'know-how' (especially the ability to 'perceive' or 'see' 'how') to have something happen.  For the sourcerer this is the deliberate identification with an act of body, speech or mind that is understood to produce certain results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first 'akanka' to be practiced can be seen by the reader for himself if he puts into practice the idea of 'see the good in people' or 'turn every adversity into a lesson,' where the choice of what to perceive and how to act to gain the desired outcome is deliberate, not a matter of hope (a source of doubt).</p>
