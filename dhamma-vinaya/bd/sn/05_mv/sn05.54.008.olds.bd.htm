					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man addressed the Beggars there: <i>"Bhikkhus!"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Suchwise 'developed', beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">I too beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this remembering the respiration serenity is thus developed, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">If a pleasant sensation is experienced,<br />

					<p class="f4">If an unpleasant sensation is experienced,<br />
					it is experienced without bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a sensation which is not unpleasant but not pleasant is experienced,<br />
					it is experienced without bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is the experience of the sense that<br />

					he knows: 'I am experiencing the sense<br />

					<p class="f4">If there is the experience of the sense<br />

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />

It is not a 'wish' or 'desire' or simply a thought or plan (where there is doubt as to the outcome ... it is no more a matter of 'wishing' than is making a choice between two paths, one which leads to one's destination and the other which does not. The meaning is 'intend' in the sense used by Castaneda's Don Juan. It is a combination of the 'will' and the 'know-how' (especially the ability to 'perceive' or 'see' 'how') to have something happen.  For the sorcerer this is the deliberate identification with an act of body, speech or mind that is understood to produce certain results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first <i>'akanka'</i> to be practiced can be seen by the reader for himself if he puts into practice the idea of 'see the good in people' or 'turn every adversity into a lesson,' where the choice of what to perceive and how to act to gain the desired outcome is deliberate, not a matter of hope (a source of doubt).</p>
