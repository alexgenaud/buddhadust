					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Agéd One Mahā Kappina,<br />
					was seated not far from <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					mind attending to the mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>Bhagava,</i> having seen the Agéd One Mahā Kappina seated nearby,<br />
					body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					mind attending to the mouth,<br />
					said this to the beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you see, beggars,<br />
					any squirming around<br />
					or trembling<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the body of that beggar there?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whenever we see this Agéd One, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					whether seated in a group<br />
					or seated alone by himself,<br />
					we do not see any squirming around<br />
					or trembling<br />
					in the body of that Agéd One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, beggars, because of the development<br />
					and making much of high-getting<br />
					that there is neither squirming around<br />
					or trembling in body,<br />
					nor squirming around<br />
					or trembling in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beggars, this beggar gains serenity<br />
					at pleasure,<br />
					without distress,<br />
					without difficulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And which serenity is it, beggars,<br />
					that developed and made much of<br />
					has neither squirming around<br />
					or trembling in body,<br />
					nor squirming around<br />
					or trembling in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Recollecting aspiration-serenity, beggars,<br />
					developed and made much of<br />
					has neither squirming around<br />
					or trembling in body,<br />
					nor squirming around<br />
					or trembling in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how developed, beggars,<br />
					how made much of<br />
					does that respiration-remembering-serenity<br />
					have neither squirming around<br />
					or trembling in body,<br />
					nor squirming around<br />
					or trembling in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar<br />
					having gotten himself off to the forest<br />

					or to some empty hut,<br />
					and having taken up his seat there<br />
					sitting down,<br />
					setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					recollecting he attends to the mouth,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am inspiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he breaths out deeply, he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am expiring deeply.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Iñjitattaṃ</i> and <i>phanditattaṃ.</i> The two main divisions here are intentional movements (including such things as having got caught up in a train of thought and reacting to imaginary situations with bodily gestures) and control of 'spontaneous' movements caused by the release of tension. Although here it is the absence of any movement that is being discussed and that in the context of what is to be understood is an advanced meditator, and really describes a state that is a result of a deep bodily tranquillity, to make this an instruction applicable across the spectrum from beginner to advanced, there must be some allowance for the beginner's deliberate adjustment of the posture and for the more advanced, change of posture consequent upon release of tensions. Properly managed, the former should be in the form of a deliberate, controlled re-adjustment to the upright posture when the posture has become distorted and interferes with concentration and also does not seem to yield to correction by way of release of tensions; the latter should be released under control and not produce any 'jerking' or 'twitching.'<br />
					So 'movement' would be too inclusive; Woodward's 'wavering or shaking" and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi's 'shaking or trembling' are to be seen among the various kinds of movements involved; Flickering is used by some seers to describe the condition; jerking, flapping, intentional movement, adjusting, twisting, twitching, etc.</p>
