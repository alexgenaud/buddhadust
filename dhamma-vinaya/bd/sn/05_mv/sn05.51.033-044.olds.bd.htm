					<p class="f4">2. In the same way, beggars, as whatever great rivers there are<br />
					incline towards the sea,<br />
					tend towards the sea,<br />
					head towards the sea,<br />
					even so, beggars, a beggar who develops the four power-paths,<br />
					makes a big thing of the four power-paths,<br />
					inclines towards Nibbāna,<br />
					tends towards Nibbāna,<br />
					heads towards Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, does a beggar develop the four power-paths,<br />
					make a big thing of the four power-paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how, beggars, a beggar develops the four power-paths,<br />
					makes a big thing of the four power-paths,<br />
					such that he inclines towards Nibbāna,<br />
					tends towards Nibbāna,<br />
					heads towards Nibbāna.</p>
