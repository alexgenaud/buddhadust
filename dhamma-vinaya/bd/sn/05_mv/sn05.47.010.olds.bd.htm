					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the elder Ānanda,<br />

					having drawn near,<br />
					took seats to one side<br />
					sitting to one side,<br />
					one sister said to the elder Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, bhante Ānanda, a large number of sisters<br />

					<p class="f4">After that then the elder Ānanda,<br />
					having instructed,<br />
					convinced,<br />
					invigorated,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then after that the elder Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">In that case, it is now time to withdraw!'</p>

					and does not think<br />
					and does not ponder.</p>
