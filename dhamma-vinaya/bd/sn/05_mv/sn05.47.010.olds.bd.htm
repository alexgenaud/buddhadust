					Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the elder Ānanda,<br />

					having drawn near,<br />
					took seats to one side<br />
					sitting to one side,<br />
					one sister said to the elder Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, <i>Bhante</i> Ānanda, a large number of sisters<br />

					<p class="f4">After that then the elder Ānanda,<br />
					having instructed,<br />
					convinced,<br />
					invigorated,<br />
					and pleased those sisters<br />
					with a discourse on <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after that the elder Ānanda,<br />

					having eaten his meal,<br />
					approached the Lucky Man and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near,<br />
