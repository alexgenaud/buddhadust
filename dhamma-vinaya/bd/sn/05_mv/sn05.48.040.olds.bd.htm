					<h1>In Order Experienced</h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the Pali.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>
					
					<p>There is some discussion of this sutta centering on the question: How is it that this sutta speaks of ending domanassa in the second jhana, when unholsome states are spoken of as being gotten rid of to attain the first jhana?</p>
					
					<p>The very first thing to understand here is that 'dukkha' or 'domanassa' or any of the other terms mentioned here are not the same things as 'Dukkh'indriyam', etc. The sutta is not speaking about 'dukkha', etc., it is speaking about 'dukkha-indriya' 'dukkha's force' or 'the force of dukkha'.</p>
					
					<p>The second thing to understand is that the translation of 'indriya' as 'sense organ' or 'faculty' breaks down here. The Indriya are 'forces'; energy fields. How is 'dukkha' (pain) in any way a sense organ or faculty?</p>
					
					<p>The next thing to understand is that neither pain nor the force of pain (or any of the other forces and their sources) are in-and-of-themselves unholsome states. It is the personal reaction to the force that is the unholsome state. The force can exist or appear to one without it being allowed to become an unholsome state.</p>
					
					<p>Again, to understand that this is not a corrupt sutta it must be understood that the Forces are not things in-and-of themselves. They are terms describing the potential of things which arise during jhana (or elsewhere) to disrupt the jhana or other aspects of one's practice.</p>
					
					<p>'Force' describes the ability of a thing to affect one. Like 'horse-power'. The force of a hurricane (1,2,3,4) is not the wind or rain, it is the power of the wind or rain to cause damage. The force of an earthquake (5, 6, 7) is a measure of its ability to cause damage. It is not the actual shaking of the earth.</p>
					
					<p>So the force of dukkha is not pain itself, but its potential to cause one to become upset, want to get away from it, or for it to otherwise disrupt one's ability to achieve freedom from pain. Rebirth has enormous potential to cause disturbance. Physical pain much less so.</p>
					
					<p>These forces can enter your practice at any stage. You have been sitting in the first jhana, above unskillful states, for the past three hours and that pain in the ass that arises after such a time from the impression made there from the seam in your pants threatens to cause you to get up and do something else. Recognizing in the force of pain, its ability to disturb your sitting practice, knowing how it arises (from wanting to get rid of the pain itself), knowing how it ends (by ending the wanting), one has recognized and understood the force.</p>
					
					<p>The work of entering the various jhana, the factors involved in attaining the jhanas, progressively eliminates the various forces as described in the sutta.</p>
					
					<p>Though the pain may endure, it does not disturb.</p>
					
					<p>The force of pain is to be got rid of in the first jhana; pain itself may not be got rid of before the fourth jhana, the unskillful state of being disturbed by the force is got rid of prior to the first jhana.</p>
					
					<p>The force of misery (domanassa) is to be eliminated by the process of entering the second jhana, domanassa itself may not be eliminated before achieving the third jhana in the process of entering the fourth jhana, the unskillful state of being disturbed by the force is to be got rid of prior to the first jhana.</p>
					
					<p>And it is the same with the other forces.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> CSCD titles this sutta Uppaṭipāṭika Bhk. Bodhi, apparently following PED (Ud + paṭipāṭi) translates: "Irregular Order". Woodward follows commentary which refers it to the chapter title, giving Uppaṭi-pāṭika, 'Arisen with reference to what has gone before'. What we have here is the Forces presented in an unusual order. The 'regular order' of this group of forces is: Pleasure, Pain, Mental Pleasure, Mental Pain, Detachment. In this sutta the order is altered. The order as we have it here comports with the order in which these forces should be (or, rather, will be) eliminated by the meditator. So we can reconcile the differences by the idea: 'Listed in order of their importance to the meditator." thus my: "In Order Experienced".</p>
