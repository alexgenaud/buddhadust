<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Samyutta Nikaya 5: Maha Vagga; Samyutta 55: Sotapatti Samyutta; Sutta 21. Because Mahanama is occasionally beset with sense-desires he is concerned about his future destiny. The Buddha tells him not to fear for he has long had faith, virtue, learning, the practice of letting go, and insight. His mind is likened to the butter in a crock of butter tossed into a pond where when the crock cracks open the butter rises to the surface." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man,<br />
					among the Sakkas residing,<br />
					Kapilavatthu, Nigrodha's Woods.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Mahānāma the Sakkian approached The Lucky Man,<br />
					and drew near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having drawn near,<br />
					and exchanged greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seated to one side, then, Mahānāma the Sakkian said this to The Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This Kaplivatthu, bhante, is thriving,<br />
					prosperous,<br />
					and densely populous<br />
					filled with humanity<br />
					stacked in oppressive heaps.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when, bhante, at eventide,<br />
					after sitting in worshipful attendence on the Lucky Man,<br />
					or on the beggars developing mind,<br />
					I enter Kapilavatthu,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control elephant,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control horse,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control chariot,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control cart,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control person.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, at such a time bhante,<br />
					I become forgetful of the Lucky Man<br />
					forgetful of the Dhamma<br />
					forgetful of the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such a time, bhante,<br />
					I have this thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'If, at this time,<br />
					my time were up,<br />
					what would be my getting?<br />
					what would be the follow-up for me?'"</p>
