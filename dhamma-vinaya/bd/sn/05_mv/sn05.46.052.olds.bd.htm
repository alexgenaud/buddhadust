<meta name="description" content="The Michael Olds translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga: 52. The exact similarity in the outward form of the practices of a group of ascetics with one method of instruction used by The Buddha leads to the question of what is the difference between the two sects. The Buddha reveals an interpretation of the doctrine unique to the understanding of the awakened mind, inaccesable through any other source." />

					<p class="f4">There then a number of beggars,<br />
					earlier having taken bowl and robes,<br />
					set out for Sāvatthī-town<br />
					in quest of handouts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these beggars thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is too early now<br />

					<p class="f4">How about if we approach the park<br />

					with those wanderers holding other positions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and salutations,<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />

					<p class="f4">"The shaman Gotama, friends,<br />
					teaches his students <i>Dhamma</i> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let go of the five diversions,<br />
					corruptions of the heart,<br />
					makers of debilitated wisdom,<br />
					and take up just this seven dimensions of awakening.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But then, friends, we too<br />

					<p class="f4">Here now friends,<br />

					<p class="f4">What makes for divergence<br />
					between shaman Gotama and ourselves,<br />
					that is to say between<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i> teaching and <i>Dhamma</i> teaching,<br />
					doctrine and doctrine?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those beggars,<br />
					neither approved of nor disparaged<br />
					what was said by the wanderers holding other positions,<br />
					but neither approving nor disparaging<br />
					they rose from their seats saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will learn what the Lucky Man has to say<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">There then these beggars,<br />
					after wandering Sāvatthi for handouts,<br />
					after eating,<br />
					returning from their begging-rounds,<br />
					approached the Lucky Man and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near the Lucky Man,<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					these beggars said this to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This morning, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					having previously taken bowl and robes,<br />
					we set out for Sāvatthī-town<br />
					in quest of handouts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then we thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and salutations,<br />

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Thus spoken to, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">Put to the wanders holding other positions, beggars,<br />
