<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Samyutta Nikaya 5: Maha Vagga; Samyutta 55: Sotapatti Samyutta; Sutta 22.  Because Mahanama is occasionally beset with sense-desires he is concerned about his future destiny. The Buddha tells him not to fear for he has long had faith, virtue, learning, the practice of letting go, and insight. His mind is likened to a tree that is bent to an angle; when it is cut down, it falls in the direction of its bent." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man,<br />
					among the Sakkas residing,<br />
					Kapilavatthu, Nigrodha's Woods.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Mahānāma the Sakkian<br />
					approached The Lucky Man,<br />
					and drew near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having drawn near,<br />
					and exchanged greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seated to one side, then,<br />
					Mahānāma the Sakkian said this to The Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This Kaplivatthu, bhante, is thriving,<br />
					prosperous,<br />
					and densely populous<br />
					filled with humanity<br />
					stacked in oppressive heaps.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when, bhante, at eventide,<br />
					after sitting in worshipful attendence on the Lucky Man,<br />
					or on the beggars developing mind,<br />
					I enter Kapilavatthu,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control elephant,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control horse,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control chariot,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control cart,<br />
					I might encounter an out-of-control person.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, at such a time bhante,<br />
					I become forgetful of the Lucky Man<br />
					forgetful of the Dhamma<br />
					forgetful of the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such a time, bhante,<br />
					I have this thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'If, at this time,<br />
					my time were up,<br />
					what would be my getting?<br />
					what would be the follow-up for me?'"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">"Never fear, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Never fear, Mahānāma!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not bad will your becoming be after death,<br />
					not bad your time's end.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four, good Mahānāma, are forms<br />
					possessed of which the student of the Aristocrats<br />
					inclines towards Nibbāna,<br />
					slops towards Nibbāna,<br />
					is lead on to Nibbāna.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are these four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here Mahānāma, the student of the Aristocrats<br />
					has got complete confidence in the Buddha<br />
					along such lines as:<br />
					'This Lucky Man is the Arahant<br />
					Number One Self-Awakened One,<br />
					perfected in conduct and vision,<br />
					The Welcome One,<br />
					a knower of the world,<br />
					unsurpassable trainer of trainable men,<br />
					teacher of gods and man,<br />
					The Buddha,<br />
					The Lucky Man'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He has complete confidence in the Dhamma<br />
					along such lines as:<br />
					'The Dhamma is well said by the Lucky Man,<br />
					to be seen for one's self here,<br />
					not a thing of Time,<br />
					a 'come'n-see' thing,<br />
					a thing that guides the intelligent<br />
					in understanding for themselves.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He has complete confidence in the Saŋgha<br />
					along such lines as:<br />
					'The Bhagava's Order of the Hearers<br />
					is undertaking the good,<br />
					The Bhagava's Order of the Hearers<br />
					is undertaking the straight,<br />
					The Bhagava's Order of the Hearers<br />
					is undertaking the method,<br />
					The Bhagava's Order of the Hearers<br />
					is undertaking the highest;<br />
					The four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight individual men —<br />
					this is the Bhagava's Order of the Hearers<br />
					that is worthy of offerings,<br />
					that are worthy guests,<br />
					worthy of the gifts<br />
					of those wishing to make good kamma,<br />
					worthy of the gesture<br />
					of putting together the fingers of both hands<br />
					and stretching them forth to the sky<br />
					and bringing them to the forehead,<br />
					a site unsurpassed in the world<br />
					for sewing merit.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he comes to be one<br />
					who goes after getting that intact,<br />
					unrent,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					unbruised,<br />
					unwarped,<br />
					praised by the wise,<br />
					uncorrupted,<br />
					ethical culture<br />
					that evolves into highetting<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, Mahānāma, if a tree,<br />
					inclined towards the East,<br />
					sloping towards the East,<br />
					pointing towards the East,<br />
					were to be cut down at the base —<br />
					in which direction would it fall?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"However, bhante, it inclined,<br />
					however it sloped,<br />
					however it was pointing."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even so then, Mahānāma,<br />
					these four are forms possessed of which<br />
					the student of the Aristocrats<br />
					inclines towards Nibbāna,<br />
					slops towards Nibbāna,<br />
					is lead on to Nibbāna.</p>
