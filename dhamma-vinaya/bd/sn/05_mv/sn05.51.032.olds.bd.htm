					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There then The Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. What is it, do you think, begggars,<br />
					that was developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by the Tathāgata,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being of such great power?</p>

					<p class="f4">For us bhante, things are best restsorted to rooted in the Lucky Man, channeled through Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, bhante, if further explanation of this point were given by the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is said by the Lucky Man will be held in memory by the beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen up then beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Four then, beggars,<br />
					are the power-paths that were developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by the Tathāgata,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being of such great power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Here beggars, the Tathāgata<br />
					develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. He develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. He develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. He develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. These then, beggars,<br />
					are the four power-paths that were developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by bhikkhu Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being of such great power.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the Tathāgata<br />
					experiences not just one of the various sorts of power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one he also becomes many,<br />
					being many he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here, transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand the Moon and Sun, as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body even in the Brahma world.</p>
					<p class="f4">11. It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the Tathāgata<br />
					with purified godlike hearing,<br />
					beyond that of ordinary men,<br />
					hears both sounds:<br />
					godly and man-made,<br />
					far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the Tathāgata —<br />
					of other beings,<br />
					of other men,<br />
					heart encompassing heart,<br />
					he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a lustful heart: "This is a lustful heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a lust-free heart: "This is a lust-free heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a hateful heart: "This is a hateful heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a hate-free heart: "This is a hate-free heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a clogged up heart: "This is a clogged up heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an unclogged heart: "This is an unclogged heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an deranged heart: "This is a deranged heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a balanced heart: "This is a balanced heart"</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a constricted heart: "This is a constricted heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an unconstricted heart: "This is an unconstricted heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a state of heart that is less than superior: "This is a state of heart that is less than superior."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a state of heart that is superior: "This state of heart is nothing less than superior."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of useless heart: "This is a useless heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a beneficial heart: "This is a beneficial heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a heart that is not free: "This is a heart that is not free."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a heart that is freed: "This is a heart that is freed."</p>

					<p class="f4">13. It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the Tathāgata<br />
					recollects not just one arrangement of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">For example:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just one birth,<br />
					just two births,<br />
					just three births,<br />
					just four births,<br />
					just five births,<br />
					just ten births,<br />
					just twenty births,<br />
					just thirty births,<br />
					just fourty births,<br />
					just fifty births,<br />
					one hundred births in all,<br />
					a thousand births in all,<br />
					a hundred-thousand births in all,<br />
					not just one evolution of a kappa,<br />
					not just one devolution of a kappa,<br />
					not just one evolution and devolution of a kappa.</p>

					<p class="f4">That there:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a name<br />
					of such a clan<br />
					of such color<br />
					of such food<br />
					of such experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					of such coming to life's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that, re-appearing elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that habitation:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a name<br />
					of such a clan<br />
					of such color<br />
					of such food<br />
					of such experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					of such coming to life's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that reborn here."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with it's makeup in detail,<br />
					he recollects not just one arrangement of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">14. It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the Tathāgata <br />
					sees beings with purified godlike sight<br />
					surpassing that of mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows of beings<br />
					their	shifting away, re-appearance,<br />
					being left behind, advancing,<br />
					their beauty, their uglyness,<br />
					their experiencing of pleasure, experiencing of pain,<br />
					according to their intentional deeds:</p>

					<p class="f4">For sure these good beings were<br />
					committed to injurious bodily conduct,<br />
					committed to injurious verbal conduct,<br />
					committed to injurious mental conduct,<br />
					denegrated Aristocrats,<br />
					held low views,<br />
					were committed to behavior in accordance with low views,<br />
					for upon the break up of the body after death<br />
					they have arisen in states of woe,<br />
					pain,<br />
					punishment,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">For sure these good beings were<br />
					committed to beneficial bodily conduct,<br />
					committed to beneficial verbal conduct,<br />
					committed to beneficial mental conduct,<br />
					spoke well of Aristocrats,<br />
					were of high view,<br />
					were committed to behavior in accordance with high view,<br />
					for upon the break up of the body after death<br />
					they have arisen in worlds of heavonly pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he sees beings with purified godlike sight<br />
					surpassing that of mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows of beings<br />
					their	shifting away, re-appearance,<br />
					being left behind, advancing,<br />
					their beauty, their uglyness,<br />
					their experiencing of pleasure, experiencing of pain,<br />
					according to their intentional deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. And further, beggars, it is because he has thus developed,<br />
					thus made a big thing of the four power-paths,<br />
					that through his own higher knowledge the Tathāgata experienced<br />
					the destruction of the corrupting influences,<br />
					and without corrupting influences,<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					enters into and lives<br />
					in freedom of heart,<br />
					freedom of wisdom.</p>
