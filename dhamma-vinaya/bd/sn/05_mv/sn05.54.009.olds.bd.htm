					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					Vesālī-land revisiting,<br />
					Great-Woods,<br />
					House with the peaked roof.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time <i>Bhagava</i> commonly preached to the beggars there<br />
					in a multiplicity of ways<br />
					about the subject of the impure;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lucky man addressed the <i>bhikkhus:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"I wish, beggars,<br />
					to retire to chambers<br />
					for the half month.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one should approach me<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante</i>", the beggars responded in agreement<br />
					and subsequently no one approached the Lucky Man<br />
					except the one who brought his mess-bowl food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The <i>Bhagava</i> used to preach<br />
					in a multiplicity of ways<br />
					about the subject of the impure;<br />
					speaking about the advantages<br />
					of talking about the subject of 'the impure',<br />

					<p class="f4">lived devoting themselves<br />

					<p class="f4">These, being depressed,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					disgusted with body,<br />
					sought out a way to take to the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one day<br />
					as many as ten <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					took to the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one day<br />
					as many as twenty <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					took to the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one day<br />
					as many as thirty <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					took to the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, returning from his retirement to chambers<br />
					at the end of that half-month,<br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> spoke thus to the Agéd Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What's this now, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinned of beings<br />
					seems the Order of <i>Bhikkhus</i>."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed that is so, <i>Bhante!</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Because the <i>Bhagava</i> preached to the beggars<br />
					in a multiplicity of ways<br />
					about the subject of the impure; <b>[<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.009.pali.bd.htm#p321">321</a>]</b><br />

					<p class="f4">lived devoting themselves<br />

					<p class="f4">These, being depressed,<br />

					<p class="f4">In one day<br />

					<p class="f4">In one day<br />
					as many as thirty <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					took to the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					if the <i>Bhagava</i> would reveal another course<br />
					to establish the order of <i>bhikkhus</i> in omniscience."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Ānanda,<br />
					whatsoever there are of <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					who have taken up residence in Vesālī<br />
					they all should be gathered together<br />
					<br />
					in the meeting hall."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so <i>Bhante</i>", said the Agéd Ānanda in reply,<br />
					and whatsoever there were of <i>bhikkhus</i><br />
					who had taken up residence in Vesālī<br />
					they all gathered together<br />
					in the meeting hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once gathered together,<br />
					Ānanda said this to <i>Bhagava:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"The <i>bhikkhu Saṅgha</i> has assembled, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					now is the time for the <i>Bhagava</i><br />
					to do what he has in mind".</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man went to the meeting hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arriving there<br />
					he sat down in the designated seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he said this to the <i>bhikkhus</i> there:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, beggars, respiration-remembering serenity<br />
					is developed<br />
					and made a big thing of<br />
					it brings peace<br />
					and living in undampened pleasure<br />
					and, additionally,<br />
					bad, unskillful things<br />
					disappear on the spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					as the stirred up dust and dirt<br />
					of the last month of summer<br />
					is settled by a great untimely thunderstorm<br />
					and is caused to disappear on the spot,<br />
					even so, beggars,<br />
					respiration-remembering serenity<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, is respiration-remembering serenity developed<br />
					and made a big thing of<br />

					sitting down,<br />
					setting the body upright,<br />
					legs bent-across-lapwise,<br />
					recollecting he attends to the mouth,<br />

					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:</p>
