					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Vesālī-land revisiting, Great-Woods, House with the peaked roof.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Bhavava use to preach to the beggars there in a multiplicity of ways about the subject of the impure<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>; speaking about the advantages of talking about the subject of 'the impure', speaking about the advantages of developing the subject of 'the impure'.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lucky man addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I wish, beggars, to retire to chambers for the half month.<br />
					No one should approach me except the one who brings my mess-bowl food."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, bhante, the beggars responded in agreement and subsequently no one approached the Lucky Man except the one who brought his mess-bowl food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those beggars, saying: "The Bhagava used to preach in a multiplicity of ways about the subject of the impure; speaking about the advantages of talking about the subject of 'the impure', speaking about the advantages of developing the subject of 'the impure'" lived devoting themselves to the development of 'the impure' in a multiplicity of ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, being depressed, ashamed, disgusted, with body, sought out a way to take to the knife,<br />
					In one day as many as ten bhikkhus took to the knife,<br />
					In one day as many as twenty bhikkhus took to the knife,<br />
					In one day as many as thirty bhikkhus took to the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, returning from his retirement to chambers at the end of that half-month, Bhagava spoke thus to the Agéd Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What's this now, Ānanda? Thinned of beings seems the Order of Bhikkhus."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed that is so, bhante! Because the Bhagava preached to the beggars in a multiplicity of ways about the subject of the impure; <b>[<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.009.pali.bd.htm#p321">321</a>]</b> speaking about the advantages of talking about the subject of 'the impure', speaking about the advantages of developing the subject of 'the impure', the beggars, bhante, saying: "The Bhagava used to preach in a multiplicity of ways about the subject of the impure; speaking about the advantages of talking about the subject of 'the impure', speaking about the advantages of developing the subject of 'the impure'" lived devoting themselves to the development of the subject of 'the impure' in a multiplicity of ways.<br />
					These, being depressed, ashamed, disgusted, with body, sought out a way to take to the knife.<br />
					As many as ten — twenty — thirty bhikkhus took to the knife in one day.<br />
					It would be good, bhante, if the Bhagava would reveal another course to establish the Order of bhikkhus in omniscience.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that case, Ānanda, whatsoever there are of bhikkhus who have taken up residence in Vesālī<br />
					they all should be gathered together in the meeting hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so bhante, said the Agéd Ānanda in reply, and whatsoever there were of bhikkhus who had taken up residence in Vesālī they all gathered together in the meeting hall.<br />
					Once gathered together, he said this to Bhagava:<br />
					"The bhikkhu Saŋgha has assembled, bhante, now is the time for the Bhagava to do what he has in mind".</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man went to the meeting hall.<br />
					Arriving there he sat down in the designated seat.<br />
					So seated he said this to the bhikkhus there:</p>

					<p class="f4">When, beggars, resperation-remembering high-getting is developed and made a big thing of it brings peace and living in undampened pleasure and, additionally, bad, unskillful things disappear on the spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars, as the stirred up dust and dirt of the last month of summer is settled by a great untimely thunderstorm and is caused to disappear on the spot,<br />
					even so, beggars, resperation-remembering high-getting developed and made a big thing of brings peace and living in undampened pleasure and, additionally, bad, unskillful things disappear on the spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, is resperation-remembering high-getting developed and made a big thing of suchas to bring peace and living in undampened pleasure and, additionally, to cause bad, unskillful things disappear on the spot?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar<br />

					recollecting he attends to the face,<br />
					just so he recollects inspiration,<br />
					just so he recollects expiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he inspires deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am inspiring deeply.'<br />
					If he breaths out deeply, he knows:<br />
					'I am expiring deeply.'</p>
