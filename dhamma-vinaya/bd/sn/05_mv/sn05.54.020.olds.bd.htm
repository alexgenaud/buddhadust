See <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm">Glossology: Asava</a>. Knowledge of the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i> is always the last step before achieving arahantship. Knowledge of having destroyed the <i>āsavas</i> is one of the three 'visions' of the Arahant. The other two are the ability to see past lives and the ability to know the outcome of a deed.</p>
