					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then another beggar approached The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached, he drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near,<br />
					he exchanged greetings,<br />
					and took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, that beggar said to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Dimension of Awakening. Dimension of Awakening,' is the expression, bhante.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then, bhante, is the scope of the expression 'Dimension of Awakening'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Think then: 'A component of Awakening' beggar,<br />
					such is the meaning of the expression: 'Dimension of Awakening.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggar, a beggar<br />
					brings to life the memory-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">He brings to life the investigation-of-things-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">He brings to life the energy-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">He brings to life the enthusiasm-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">He brings to life the impassivity-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">He brings to life the serenity-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">He brings to life the detachment-dimension of awakening<br />
					seated in solitude,<br />
					seated in dispassion,<br />
					seated in ending,<br />
					culminating in giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus having brought to life these seven dimensions of awakening<br />
					the heart is freed from the corrupting influence of sense-desire<br />
					the heart is freed from the corrupting influence of existence,<br />
					the heart is freed from the corrupting influence of blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom, having the knowledge: 'I am free,'<br />
					he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Left behind is birth,<br />
					lived is the Brahma mode,<br />
					duty's doing's done<br />
					there is no it'n-n-at'n to follow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Think then: 'A component of Awakening' beggar,<br />
					such is the meaning of the expression: 'Dimension of Awakening.'</p>
