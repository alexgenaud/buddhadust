					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Venerable Lomasavangiso,<br />
					Sakka-land,<br />
					Kapilavatthu,<br />
					Nigrodha's park revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Mahanamo the Sakkyan<br />
					approached the venerable Lomasavangiso<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Venerable Lomasavangiso<br />
					and took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					Mahanamo the Sakkyan said this<br />
					to the Venerable Lomasavangiso:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it then, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					is the seeker's life<br />
					such as the <i>Tathāgata's</i> life<br />
					or is the seekers life one thing<br />
					and the <i>Tathāgata's</i> life another?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend Mahanama,<br />
					the seeker's life<br />
					is not such as the <i>Tathāgata's</i> life,<br />
					the seeker's life is one thing,<br />
					the <i>Tathāgata's</i> life is another.</p>

					<p class="f4">That <i>bhikkhu,</i> friend Mahanama,<br />
					a seeker,<br />
					a little developed in mind,<br />
					short of his intended goal,<br />
					one who lives preparing to throw off the yoke,<br />
					the throwing off of which there is nothing better,<br />
					lives letting go of the five diversions.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives letting go of the pleasure-wishing diversion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives letting go of the deviance diversion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives letting go of the lazy ways and inertia diversion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives letting go of the anxiety and fear diversion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives letting go of the doubt and wavering diversion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is so, friend Mahanama, that a seeker,<br />
					a little developed in mind,<br />
					short of his intended goal,<br />
					one who lives preparing to throw off the yoke,<br />
					the throwing off of which there is nothing better,<br />
					lives letting go of the five diversions.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand, friend Mahanama,<br />
					that <i>bhikkhu,</i> an arahant,<br />
					without corruptions,<br />
					one who is finished,<br />
					duty's doing done,<br />
					laid down the load,<br />
					his own best interest brought forth,<br />
					the yokes to becoming thoroughly destroyed,<br />
					by highest answer-knowledge liberated,<br />
					has let go the five diversions,<br />
					made them like a palm<br />
					torn out from the ground by the roots,<br />
					without basis for life,<br />
					unable rise up again in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives having let go of the pleasure-wishing diversion,<br />
					made it like a palm<br />
					torn out from the ground by the roots,<br />
					without basis for life,<br />
					unable rise up again in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives having let go of the deviance diversion,<br />
					made it like a palm<br />
					torn out from the ground by the roots,<br />
					without basis for life,<br />
					unable rise up again in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives having let go of the lazy ways and inertia diversion,<br />
					made it like a palm<br />
					torn out from the ground by the roots,<br />
					without basis for life,<br />
					unable rise up again in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives having let go of the anxiety and fear diversion,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is thus, friend Mahanama, that a <i>bhikkhu,</i> an arahant,<br />

					laid down the load,<br />
					his own best interest brought forth,<br />

					torn out from the ground by the roots,<br />
					without basis for life,<br />
					unable rise up again in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in this way, friend Mahanama,<br />
					that you should understand that the seeker's life<br />
					is not such as the <i>Tathāgata's</i> life,<br />
					the seeker's life is one thing,<br />
					the <i>Tathāgata's</i> life is another.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, friend Mahanama,<br />
					the Lucky Man<br />
					Icchanangale revisiting,<br />
					Icchanangala jungle grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man said this<br />
					to the beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I wish, beggars, to retire to chambers for three months.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one should approach me<br />
					except the one who brings my mess-bowl food.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Bhante',<br />
					the beggars responded in agreement<br />
					and subsequently no one approached the Lucky Man<br />
					except the one who brought his mess-bowl food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after the lapse of three months,<br />
					The Lucky Man emerged from his retirement chambers<br />
					and said this to the beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Should wanderers of other views, beggars, question you thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what manner, friends, does the Shaman Gotama<br />
					largely live during the rains residency?"</p>

					<p class="f4">This being put to you, beggars,<br />
					by wanderers of other views,<br />
					this is how you should make response:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lucky Man, friends,<br />
					largely lives during the rains residency<br />
					serenely remembering his respiration."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This is deeper than the simple question it appears to be. There is a state where it appears that one has achieved arahantship and that the resulting life is the same as the life that came before. This is often brought up in Zen Buddhist contexts.<br />
					"The Way is fundamentally perfect. It penetrates everything. How could it depend on practice and realization. The <i>Dharma</i> vehicle is free and unhindered. What need can there be for the concentrated efforts of men? In truth, the Great Body is well beyond the dust of the world. Who could think it possible to clean it? It is never separate from anyone; it is always exactly where you are. Why go here or there to practice?" —Master Dogen (1200-1253), <a href="../../../../resources/pdf/fukanzazengi/fukanzazengi.pdf"><i>Fukanzazengi.</i></a> Quoted from <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/book_reviews/br_008.coupey.zen.htm">Coupey, Zen Simply Sitting.</a><br />
					The view is not confined to Zen or Mahayana schools. It is based on a real perception and is a problem similar to the one of understanding how although there is no thing there that can be called a self, there is no saying that there is no self.<br />
					Considered to be one of the more pernicious views in that it conduces to lack of striving.<br />
					<i>Tathāgata</i> here means 'one who has got the getting' and is not a specific reference to Gotama.</p>

The five: <i>kāma-c-chanda:</i> sensuality, pleasure-wishing; <i>(abhijjhā-)vyāpāda:</i> ill-will, anger, via the not-path; <i>thīna-middha:</i> sluggishness, sloth and torpor, lazy ways and inertia; <i>uddhaccakukkucca:</i> worry, fear, anxiety — <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: restlessness and remorse; <i>vicikicchā:</i> doubt, wavering, backsliding, turning back.</p>
