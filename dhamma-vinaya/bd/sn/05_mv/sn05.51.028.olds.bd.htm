					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the Elder Ānanda approached The Lucky Man<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drawing near <i>Bhagava</i><br />
					and giving salutation<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then,<br />
					the <i>Bhagava</i> said this<br />
					to the elder Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, then, Ānanda, is power?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the path to power?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the development of the power-paths?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the path going to the development of the power paths?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					things are best resorted to<br />
					rooted in the Lucky Man,<br />
					channeled through <i>Bhagava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					if further explanation of this point<br />
					were given by the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is said by the Lucky Man<br />
					will be held in memory by the beggars."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Ānanda,<br />
					listen well,<br />
					give over your mind<br />
					to what I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, <i>Bhante</i>",<br />
					the elder Ānanda then said to The Lucky Man in response.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lucky Man said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here Ānanda,<br />
					a beggar experiences<br />
					not just one of the various sorts of power:</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one<br />
					he also becomes many,<br />
					being many<br />
					he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here,<br />
					transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever<br />
					as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into<br />
					and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water<br />
					without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged<br />
					like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand<br />
					the Moon and Sun,<br />
					as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body<br />
					even in the Brahmā world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is what is called 'power'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda,<br />
					is the path to power?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever way, Ānanda,<br />
					whatever path-tracking<br />
					results in gaining power,<br />
					gaining power acquisition —</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is called<br />
					'the path to power'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda,<br />
					is the development of the power-paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making,</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda,<br />
					is what is called<br />
					'the development of the power-paths.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda,<br />
					is the path going to the development of the power-paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this very Aristocratic Eight-dimensional Way,<br />
					that is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate view,<br />
					consummate principles,<br />
					consummate talk,<br />
					consummate works,<br />
					consummate lifestyle,<br />
					consummate self-control,<br />
					consummate mind,<br />
					consummate serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda,<br />
					is what is called<br />
					'the path going to the development of the power-paths'."</p>
