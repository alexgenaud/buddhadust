					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. There then The Lucky Man addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "What is it, do you think, begggars,<br />
					that was developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by bhikkhu Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being of such great power?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us bhante, things are best restsorted to rooted in the Lucky Man, channeled through Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, bhante, if further explanation of this point were given by the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is said by the Lucky Man will be held in memory by the beggars."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Listen up then beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Four then, beggars,<br />
					are the power-paths that were developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by bhikkhu Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being of such great power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Here beggars, the bhikkhu Moggallano<br />
					develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. He develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. He develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. He develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					his heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. These then, beggars,<br />
					are the four power-paths that were developed,<br />
					made a big thing of by bhikkhu Moggallano,<br />
					that he is such an advanced being of such great power.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">10. It is because he has thus developed, beggars,<br />
					thus made a big thing of,<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the beggar Moggallāna<br />
					experiences not just one of the various sorts of power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one he also becomes many,<br />
					being many he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here, transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand the Moon and Sun, as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body even in the Brahma world.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. And further, beggars, it is because he has thus developed,<br />
					thus made a big thing of the four power-paths,<br />
					that through his own higher knowledge bhikkhu Moggallāna experienced<br />
					the destruction of the corrupting influences,<br />
					and without corrupting influences,<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					enters into and lives<br />
					in freedom of heart,<br />
					freedom of wisdom."</p>
