It is not just finding the point of origin, but the study of the development of a thing down to it's place of origin or conception. This term must serve to indicate tracing a thing to the initial point where it begins (so as to be able to uproot it), but also finding the place where a thing matures to the point of birth (so as to be able to foster it's growth). Most translations shortcut the difficulties of finding a term to serve both ends. Hence: 'study' 'careful attention' 'systematic attention'.</p>
