					<p class="f4">Once upon a time <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before my awakening, beggars,<br />
					not fully-self-awakened,<br />
					just an awakening-being,<br />
					this thought came to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, then, is the way,<br />
					what path is to be tracked<br />
					for the development of the power-paths?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Regarding this, beggars,<br />
					such is what came to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this case a beggar develops the power-path<br />
					that is wish-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my wishing not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">Live after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					the heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the power-path<br />
					that is energy-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my energy not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">Live after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					the heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the power-path<br />
					that is heart-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my heart not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">Live after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">As before so after<br />
					as after so before.</p>

					<p class="f4">As above, so below,<br />
					as below, so above.</p>

					<p class="f4">As by day, so by night,<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with clear thinking,<br />
					disentangled thinking,<br />
					the heart becomes radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the power-path<br />
					that is investigation-serenity-connected-exertion-own-making thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my investigation not be too sluggish,<br />
					not be too unrestrained,<br />
					not be inwardly cramped,<br />
					not be scattered abroad."</p>

					<p class="f4">Live after-before-perceiving:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through thus developing, beggars,<br />
					thus making a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					that the result for a beggar<br />
					will not be just one<br />
					of the various sorts of power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one<br />
					he also becomes many,<br />
					being many<br />
					he also becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest here,<br />
					transported beyond notice,<br />
					transported through walls,<br />
					transported through fortifications unsticking,<br />
					he goes whithersoever<br />
					as if in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He jumps into<br />
					and out of the earth<br />
					as though in water;<br />
					goes on water<br />
					without parting it<br />
					as though on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes through space cross-legged<br />
					like a bird on the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches and feels with the hand<br />
					the Moon and Sun,<br />
					as great and powerful as they are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He turns up in the body<br />
					even in the Brahmā world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					with purified godlike hearing,<br />
					beyond that of ordinary men,<br />
					hears both sounds:<br />
					godly and man-made,<br />
					far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths —<br />
					of other beings,<br />
					of other men,<br />
					heart encompassing heart,<br />
					he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a lustful heart:<br />
					'This is a lustful heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a lust-free heart:<br />
					'This is a lust-free heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a hateful heart:<br />
					'This is a hateful heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a hate-free heart:<br />
					'This is a hate-free heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a clogged up heart:<br />
					'This is a clogged up heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an unclogged heart:<br />
					'This is an unclogged heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an deranged heart:<br />
					'This is a deranged heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a balanced heart:<br />
					'This is a balanced heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a constricted heart:<br />
					'This is a constricted heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of an unconstricted heart:<br />
					'This is an unconstricted heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a state of heart<br />
					that is less than superior:<br />
					'This is a state of heart<br />
					that is less than superior.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a state of heart<br />
					that is superior:<br />
					'This state of heart<br />
					is nothing less than superior.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of useless heart:<br />
					'This is a useless heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a beneficial heart:<br />
					'This is a beneficial heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a heart that is not free:<br />
					'This is a heart that is not free.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a heart that is freed:<br />
					'This is a heart that is freed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					recollects not just one arrangement<br />
					of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">For example:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just one birth,<br />
					just two births,<br />
					just three births,<br />
					just four births,<br />
					just five births,<br />
					just ten births,<br />
					just twenty births,<br />
					just thirty births,<br />
					just forty births,<br />
					just fifty births,<br />
					one hundred births in all,<br />
					a thousand births in all,<br />
					a hundred-thousand births in all,<br />
					not just one evolution of a kappa,<br />
					not just one devolution of a kappa,<br />
					not just one evolution and devolution of a kappa.</p>

					<p class="f4">That there:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I was of such a name<br />
					of such a clan<br />
					of such color<br />
					of such food<br />
					of such experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					of such coming to life's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that,<br />
					re-appearing elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that habitation:</p>

					<p class="f4">I was of such a name<br />
					of such a clan<br />
					of such color<br />
					of such food<br />
					of such experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					of such coming to life's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Shifting away from that<br />
					I was reborn here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with its makeup in detail,<br />
					he recollects not just one arrangement<br />
					of previous inhabitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					he sees beings with purified godlike sight<br />
					surpassing that of mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows of beings<br />
					their	shifting away,<br />
					re-appearance,<br />
					being left behind,<br />
					advancing,<br />
					their beauty,<br />
					their ugliness,<br />
					their experiencing of pleasure,<br />
					experiencing of pain,<br />
					according to their intentional deeds:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For sure these good beings were<br />
					committed to injurious bodily conduct,<br />
					committed to injurious verbal conduct,<br />
					committed to injurious mental conduct,<br />
					denigrated Aristocrats,<br />
					held low views,<br />
					were committed to behavior<br />
					in accordance with low views,<br />
					for upon the break up of the body after death<br />
					they have arisen in states of woe,<br />
					pain,<br />
					punishment,<br />
					<i>Niraya</i> Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">For sure these good beings were<br />
					committed to beneficial bodily conduct,<br />
					committed to beneficial verbal conduct,<br />
					committed to beneficial mental conduct,<br />
					spoke well of Aristocrats,<br />
					were of consummate view,<br />
					were committed to behavior<br />
					in accordance with consummate view,<br />
					for upon the break up of the body after death<br />
					they have arisen in worlds of heavenly pleasures.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he sees beings<br />
					with purified godlike sight<br />
					surpassing that of mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows of beings<br />
					their	shifting away,<br />
					re-appearance,<br />
					being left behind,<br />
					advancing,<br />
					their beauty,<br />
					their ugliness,<br />
					their experiencing of pleasure,<br />
					experiencing of pain,<br />
					according to their intentional deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus developed, then beggars,<br />
					a beggar thus making a big thing of<br />
					the four power-paths,<br />
					through his own higher knowledge<br />
					experiences the destruction of the corrupting influences,<br />
					and without corrupting influences,<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					enters into and lives<br />
					in freedom of heart,<br />
					freedom of wisdom."</p>
