					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then a large number of beggars approached Bhagava and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near they exchanged greetings together with Bhagava.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings and shared friendly talk they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Bhagava said this to those beggars there:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Now can it be, Beggars, that one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfilment four things;<br />
					that four things,<br />
					developed and made made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment seven things;<br />
					that seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment two things?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava is the root of Dhamma for us, bhante,<br />
					Bhagava is the channel for Dhamma<br />
					Bhagava is the custodian.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely it would be well, bhante,<br />
					if the point of this were to occur to Bhagava to explain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagava saying it,<br />
					the beggars will bear it in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can be, beggars that one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfilment four things;<br />
					that four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment seven things;<br />
					that seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment two things."</p>

					<p class="f4">But, bhante, what one thing,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					brings to fulfilment four things;<br />
					what four things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment seven things;<br />
					what seven things,<br />
					developed and made much of,<br />
					bring to fulfilment two things?</p>

					<p class="f4">Recollecting-aspiration-serenity, beggars, is one thing,<br />
