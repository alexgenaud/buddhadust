The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that it is the degree to which they have mastered faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom that determines their having attained the various degrees of accomplishment in his system from Faith Follower to Arahant. In this sutta the list of degrees of accomplishment is somewhat expanded." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xvitthaara"><i>Vitthāra.</i></a> The Buddha teaches either in brief or in detail.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See the Glssology entry <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>Indriyāni</i></a> for a discussion of the difference (and how they can also be thought of as the same) between <i>Indriya</i> and <i>Bala.</i> PED for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xindriya">Indriya.</a></p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Arahant</i>ship is here placed as the ultimate goal with those below being lesser accomplishments. <i>Arahant</i>ship is in most other places said to be attained by persons still living in this world where in that case they would not yet be thought of as having fully attained the "culminating" point <i>(parinibbāna)</i> of the <i>Dhamma.</i></p> 

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Antarā.</i> Midway or in the middle. This means either between death here and thorough Nibbāna, or half way through the next life. Woodward: "release" (for <i>parinibbāna</i>) "midway"; Bhikkhu Bodhi: "in the interval". None of this, including my own here and elsewhere is clearly explained. My personal belief is that this means beween death of the body here and attainment of thoroughgoing <i>Nibbāna.</i> I justify this to myself by pointing to the state of the Non-Returner going to the Pure Abodes four steps below this, where such a one is described as attaining Nibbāna half-way (midway) through that life. A much lower attainment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Upahacca.</i> Reduced. Broken up. Partly destroyed. This is understood to mean that the individual's time either here or in some other world is reduced. But there is nothing in the term that speaks of time. Woodward: "reduction of his time", Bhikkhu Bodhi: "upon landing". Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation makes no sense to me at all. There is no mention of "landing" in the Pāḷi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i><a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsa-nkhaara">Saṅkhāra:</a> a-saṅkhāra, sa-saṅkhāra</i> Identification with the intent to create personal pleasurable sense experience through acts of thought, word, and deed and the identified with result. I translate with "own-making" because that is what it means and there is some justification in the etymology: <i>saṅ</i> = self =own; <i>khāra</i> = making. Bhkkhu Thanissaro: fabrications; Woodward here: trouble; PTS generally: conditioning, activities; Bhikkhu Bodhi: exertion, usually volitional or intentional activities. I explain this to myself in this way: the person without own-making does no longer do stuff, but may have stuff from past own-making that has yet to be dealt with; in the second case the person is still identifying with the making or doing of things to be experienced.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Akaniṭṭha.</i> No youngsters here. The highest of the <i>Brahmā</i> realms which is also the highest of the Pure Abodes; the <i>Suddhavasa</i> Realms: <i>Aviha, Attappa, Sudassa, Sudassi,</i> and <i>Akaniṭṭha:</i> — (listed in ascending order) special abodes where Non-Returners gather in an atmosphere highly conducive to attaining final <i>Nibbāna.</i> Life in these realms always ends in realizing <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
					PED: <i>akaniṭṭha</i> "not the smaller" i.e. the greatest, highest; in <i>akaniṭṭhagāmin</i> going to the highest gods.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Elsewhere (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.55.024.wood.pts.htm">SN 5.55.24</a>) these latter two are also spoken of as Stream-winners.</p>
