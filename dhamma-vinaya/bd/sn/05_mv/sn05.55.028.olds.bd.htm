					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting, Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta-forest park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, Anāthapiṇḍika, the housefather, approached the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached, he drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near he exchanged greetings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings Anāthapiṇḍika, the housefather took a steat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, steated to one side, the Lucky Man said this to Anāthapiṇḍika, the housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now whenever, housefather,<br />
					in the student of aristocracy,<br />
					the five fears of retribution are allayed,<br />
					and four dimensions of Stream-entry have been mastered,<br />
					and he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated<br />
					the aristocratic method,<br />
					he may with certainty of his aspiration<br />
					by himself, of himself<br />
					predict:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is Hell for me,<br />
					destroyed is the creeper's womb,<br />
					destroyed is the ghostly garb,<br />
					destroyed is falling away,<br />
					depression,<br />
					repeated failure.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Streamwinner am I!</p>

					<p class="f4">An unfailing thing,<br />
					assured,<br />
					destined for self-awakening.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What five fears of retribution has he allayed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, housefather, for him who injures breathing things,<br />
					from injury to breathing things,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in the hereafter,<br />
					experienced in the heart as pain and misery,<br />
					in abstention from injury to breathing things,<br />
					that fear of retribution is allayed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, housefather, for him who takes what is not given,<br />
					from taking what is not given,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in the hereafter,<br />
					experienced in the heart as pain and misery,<br />
					in abstention from taking what is not given,<br />
					that fear of retribution is allayed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, housefather, for he who carries on in an ungodly way,<br />
					from carrying on in an ungodly way,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in the hereafter,<br />
					experienced in the heart as pain and misery,<br />
					in abstention from carrying on in an ungodly way,<br />
					that fear of retribution is allayed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, housefather, for him who utters negligent speech,<br />
					from uttering negligent speech,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in the hereafter,<br />
					experienced in the heart as pain and misery,<br />
					in abstention from uttering negligent speech,<br />
					that fear of retribution is allayed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, housefather, for him who behaves carelessly because of fermented and distilled drink,<br />
					from behaving carelessly because of fermented and distilled drink,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in this seen thing,<br />
					results in fear of retribution<br />
					in the hereafter,<br />
					experienced in the heart as pain and misery,<br />
					in abstention from behaving carelessly because of fermented and distilled drink,<br />
					that fear of retribution is allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five fears of retribution he has allayed.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What four dimensions of Stream-entry has he  mastered?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, of the Buddha, the student of aristocracy is possessed of certain clarity:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just he is the Lucky Man,<br />
					Aristocrat,<br />
					consummately self-awakened one,<br />
					possesser of vision and conduct,<br />
					the Welcome,<br />
					Worldly-wise,<br />
					people's unsurpassed Dhamma-coach,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					Buddha,<br />
					The Lucky Man.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Dhamma, the student of aristocracy is possessed of certain clarity:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well revealed is the Lucky Man's Dhamma,<br />
					a seen-here thing,<br />
					timeless,<br />
					a come-and-see thing<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					something to be experienced for one's self by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Order, the student of aristocracy is possessed of certain clarity:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Practicing well is the Lucky Man's Order of students,<br />
					of upright practice is the Lucky Man's Order of students,<br />
					practicing the method is the Lucky Man's Order of students,<br />
					practicing consummately is the Lucky Man's Order of students.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say it is the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight good men —<br />
					that is the Lucky Man's Order of students<br />
					that is worthy of veneration,<br />
					worthy of hospitality,<br />
					worthy of handouts,<br />
					worthy of salutation,<br />
					an unsurpassable field of prosperity for the world.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is possessed of ethics praised by the Aristocrats —<br />
					unbroken,<br />
					without gaps,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					unblemished,<br />
					liberating,<br />
					not disparaged by the wise,<br />
					beyond, second to none,<br />
					evolving into serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four dimensions of Stream-entry he has mastered?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that aristocratic method<br />
					he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, housefather, the student of aristocracy<br />
					thoroughly mentally studies points of conception<br />
					of mutually bound up stimuli,<br />
					so:</p>

					<p class="f4">This 'this' being, that is had;<br />
					with this support, that comes to birth;</p>

					<p class="f4">This 'this' not being, that is not had;<br />
					this ending, that subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Blindness-stimuli: own-making,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					own-making-stimuli: consciousness,<br />
					consciousness-stimuli: named-form,<br />
					named-form-stimuli: the six realms of sense,<br />
					the six realms of sense-stimuli: contact,<br />
					contact-stimuli: sensation<br />
					sensation-stimuli: thirst,<br />
					thirst-stimuli: support,<br />
					support-stimuli: existence,<br />
					existence-stimuli: birth,<br />
					birth-stimuli: aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is had this self-sustaining mutually bound up body of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus also:</p>

					<p class="f4">Blindness'-ending: own-making's-ending,<br />
					own-making's-ending: consciousness'-ending,<br />
					consciousness'-ending: named-form's-ending,<br />
					named-form's-ending: the six realms of sense's-ending,<br />
					the six realms of sense's-ending: contact's-ending,<br />
					contact's-ending: sensation's-ending<br />
					sensation's-ending: thirst's-ending,<br />
					thirst's-ending: support's-ending,<br />
					support's-ending: existence's-ending,<br />
					existence's-ending: birth's-ending,<br />
					birth's-ending: aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair's-ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is had the end of this self-sustaining mutually bound up body of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is that aristocratic method<br />
					he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now whenever, housefather,<br />
					in the student of aristocracy,<br />
					these five fears of retribution are allayed,<br />
					and these four dimensions of Stream-entry have been mastered,<br />
					and he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated<br />
					the aristocratic method,<br />
					he may with certainty of his aspiration<br />
					by himself, of himself<br />
					predict:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is Hell for me,<br />
					destroyed is the creeper's womb,<br />
					destroyed is the ghostly garb,<br />
					destroyed is falling away,<br />
					depression,<br />
					repeated failure.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Streamwinner am I!</p>

					<p class="f4">An unfailing thing,<br />
					assured,<br />
					destined for self-awakening.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Avijjāpaccayā saŋkhārā.</i> Here this is just a list or table of mutually bound up conditions and is not a series of clauses in a sentence to be read out as with Woodward: "Conditioned by ignorance, activities come to pass", or Bhk. Bodhi: "With ignorance as condition, volitional formations [come to be]." To read it that way is a short-cut that ignores the instruction that what should be done with the pairs of items in this list is to subject them to examination in mind per the previously described method:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'this' being, that is had;<br />
					with this support, that comes to birth;</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'this' not being, that is not had;<br />
					this ending, that subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">So:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'blindness-stimuli' being, own-making is had;<br />
					with blindness-stimuli support, own-making comes to birth;</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'blindness-stimuli' not being, own-making is not had;<br />
					blindness-stimuli ending, own-making subsides.</p>
