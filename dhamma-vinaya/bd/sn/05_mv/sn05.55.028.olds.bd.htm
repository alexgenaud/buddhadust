					<p class="f4">What four dimensions of Stream-entry<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather,<br />
               of the Buddha,<br />
               the student of aristocracy<br />
               is possessed of certain clarity:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just he is the Lucky Man,<br />
					Aristocrat,<br />
					consummately self-awakened one,<br />
					possessor of vision and conduct,<br />
					the Welcome,<br />
					Worldly-wise,<br />
					people's unsurpassed <i>Dhamma</i>-coach,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					Buddha,<br />
					The Lucky Man.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
               the student of aristocracy<br />
               is possessed of certain clarity:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well revealed is the Lucky Man's <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					a seen-here thing,<br />
					timeless,<br />
					a come-and-see thing<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					something to be experienced for one's self by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Order,<br />
               the student of aristocracy<br />
               is possessed of certain clarity:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Practicing well<br />
               is the Lucky Man's Order of students,<br />
					of upright practice<br />
               is the Lucky Man's Order of students,<br />
					practicing the method<br />
               is the Lucky Man's Order of students,<br />
					practicing consummately<br />
               is the Lucky Man's Order of students.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say<br />
               it is the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight good men —<br />
					that is the Lucky Man's Order of students<br />
					that is worthy of veneration,<br />
					worthy of hospitality,<br />
					worthy of handouts,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					unblemished,<br />
					liberating,<br />
					not disparaged by the wise,<br />

               second to none,<br />
					evolving into serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four dimensions of Stream-entry<br />
               he has mastered.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that aristocratic method<br />
					he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, housefather,<br />
               the student of aristocracy<br />
					thoroughly mentally studies<br />
               points of conception<br />
					of mutually bound up stimuli,<br />
					so:</p>

					<p class="f4">This 'this' being,<br />
               that is had;<br />
					with this support,<br />
               that comes to birth;</p>

					<p class="f4">This 'this' not being,<br />
               that 'that' is not had;<br />
					this ending,<br />
               that subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Blindness-stimuli: own-making,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					own-making-stimuli: consciousness,<br />
					consciousness-stimuli: named-form,<br />
					named-form-stimuli: the six realms of sense,<br />
					the six realms of sense-stimuli: contact,<br />
					contact-stimuli: sensation<br />
					sensation-stimuli: thirst,<br />
					thirst-stimuli: support,<br />
					support-stimuli: existence,<br />
					existence-stimuli: birth,<br />
					birth-stimuli: aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is had<br />
               this self-sustaining<br />
               mutually bound up<br />
               body of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus also:</p>

					<p class="f4">Blindness'-ending: own-making's-ending,<br />
					own-making's-ending: consciousness'-ending,<br />
					consciousness'-ending: named-form's-ending,<br />
					named-form's-ending: the six realms of sense's-ending,<br />
					the six realms of sense's-ending: contact's-ending,<br />
					contact's-ending: sensation's-ending<br />
					sensation's-ending: thirst's-ending,<br />
					thirst's-ending: support's-ending,<br />
					support's-ending: existence's-ending,<br />
					existence's-ending: birth's-ending,<br />
					birth's-ending: aging and death,<br />
					grief and lamentation<br />
					pain and misery,<br />
					and despair's-ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is had<br />
               the end of this self-sustaining<br />
               mutually bound up<br />
               body of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is that aristocratic method<br />
					he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now whenever, housefather,<br />
					in the student of aristocracy,<br />
					these five fears of retribution are allayed,<br />
					and these four dimensions of Stream-entry have been mastered,<br />
					and he has wisely,<br />
					well viewed,<br />
					well penetrated<br />
					the aristocratic method,<br />
					he may with certainty of his aspiration<br />
					by himself,<br />
               of himself<br />
					predict:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is Hell for me,<br />
					destroyed is creeping animal's wombs,<br />
					destroyed is the ghostly garb,<br />
					destroyed is falling away,<br />

					<p class="f4">A Streamwinner am I!</p>

					<p class="f4">An unfailing thing,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Avijjā-paccayā saṅkhārā.</i> Here this is just a list or table of mutually bound up conditions and is not a series of clauses in a sentence to be read out as with Woodward: "Conditioned by ignorance, activities come to pass", or <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi: "With ignorance as condition, volitional formations [come to be]." To read it that way is a short-cut that ignores the instruction that what should be done with the pairs of items in this list is to subject them to examination in mind per the previously described method:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'this' being,<br />
               that 'that' is had;<br />
					with this support,<br />
               that comes to birth;</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'this' not being,<br />
               that 'that' is not had;<br />
					this ending,<br />
               that subsides.</p>

					<p class="f4">So:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'blindness-stimuli' being, own-making is had;<br />
					with blindness-stimuli support,<br />
               own-making comes to birth;</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This 'blindness-stimuli' not being,<br />
               own-making is not had;<br />
					blindness-stimuli ending,<br />
               own-making subsides.</p>
