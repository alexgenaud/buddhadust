					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>upādānāni.</i> One of the most troublesome words for me. Bhk. Bodhi: 'clinging'; Woodward and others: 'Grasping', Bhk. Thanissaro uses 'clinging, sustenance' and has written that he relates this to the fueling of a fire. I don't see clinging or grasping there. I have used 'bind-up' and 'up-keep' (going to <i>'upa-dāna'</i>), 'going-after-getting' (using <i>upa ā dāna</i>). The most important place for this term to be made clear is in the Paticca Samuppada, where it is the link between thirst and being. In reaction to sensation there is thirst (or wanting or desire), in reaction to thirst upadana results in the possiblity of being some sort of being in some place of being. The breakdown of the word according to PED is <i>upa ā dā</i> 'up to give', and says:<br />
					... substratum by means of which an active process is kept alive or going), fuel, supply, provision; adj. (*-) supported by, drawing one's existence from S I.69; II 85 (aggikkhandho -assa pariyādānā by means of taking up fuel); V.284 (vāt-); J III.342 sa-upādāna (adj.) provided with fuel S IV.399; anupādāna without fuel DhA II.163. 2. (applied.) "drawing upon", grasping, holding on, grip, attachment; adj. (*-) finding one's support by or in, clinging to, taking up, nourished by.<br />
					In this sutta we are given a list of things which we can see are 'supports' for continued living, or 'fuel' for continued living. They could be 'ways one grasps after being' or 'ways one clings to being'; they could be used for the upkeep of living, or as what binds one up in living. Supports, scaffolding ...?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Kāyagantha.</i> Body-tie. Tie to existence in a body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Something I think it is helpful to point out here is that this list does not include the mind-sense. There is a distinction made throughout the suttas between the pleasure of enjoying these five senses and the use of the mind which can be categorized as a sense with dhammas as it's object or as an extra-sensory phenomena. Mind [mana] also encompasses 'heart' [citta] which is the aparatus for experience of mental states, and memory [sati] for the experience of recollection, investigation, experience of insight.' The five are lower experiences and area always to be let go whereas the mind is only a problem when it is accompanied by the idea of self. That is how I understand this. The reader should always note whether what is being referred to in a sutta is the five or the six.</p>
