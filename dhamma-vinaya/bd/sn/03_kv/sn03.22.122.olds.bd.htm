<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.122. In a dialogue between Sāriputta and Maha Kotthita Sāriputta explains how by tracing out in mind the inconstance of, pain in, diseased nature of, cancerous nature of, knotty nature of, the thorny nature of, the horror of, the oppressive nature of, the otherness of, the corruptability of, the emptiness of, the non-self of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness the ethical person can become a Streamwinner, the Streamwinner can become a Once-Returner, the Once-Returner can become a Non-Returner, the Non-Returner can become an Arahant and the Arahant can live pleasantly in this visible world." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the ancient Sāriputta<br />
					and the ancient Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br />
					Benares revisiting,<br />
					Deer Park, Isipatane.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then the ancient Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br />
					arising towards evening from his seclusion<br />
					approached the ancient Sāriputta and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near<br />
					he exchanged friendly greetings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged friendly greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side, then,<br />
					the ancient Mahā-Koṭṭhita said this<br />
					to the ancient Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"By the ethically observant beggar, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					of what things should the etiology<br />
					be given studious examination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"By the ethically observant beggar, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />

					the affliction of,<br />
					the 'otherness' of,<br />
					the chronic disease of,<br />
					the emptiness of,<br />
					the not-selfness of<br />
