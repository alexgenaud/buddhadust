					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Is it a light or is it an island? It really doesn't matter! You get the idea. But I read the Buddha's preference from the following logic: The word <i>"dipa"</i> means both island and light and lamp and also 'peninsula' and 'continent'.<br />
					<i>Atta-dipa</i> can mean Self-Island, or Self-lit so: "Live as a light unto yourself" is, at the least, heard.<br />
					<i>Atta-sarana</i> Self surrounded, in the sense of "protected" and, also, self-recollected.<br />
					<i>Anañña-sarana</i> [añña &gt; an = not; ya = whatsoever; Latin alius, Gothic aljis, Old Anglo Saxon elles &gt; English else] Not Else-Surrounded or protected.<br />
					So we can contrast <i>atta</i> with <i>anañña</i> and be relatively sure the idea is Self/Not Other or Else or Otherwise<br />
					So we can contrast <i>atta-sarana</i> with <i>anañña-sarana</i> and be relatively sure the idea isn't Self-recollected and Other-recollected.<br />
					On the other hand, there is an old link in the word <i>"sarana"</i> to <i>sarangsa,</i> The Sun's Rays. "Bathed in Light" comes to mind as a root idea of surrounded and protected.<br />
					And then we have the second set of three terms:<br />
					Dhamma-dipa which would mean Dhamma-Islanded as with Woodward, or Dhamma-lit or illuminated<br />
					<i>Dhamma-sarana</i> taking refuge in the Dhamma or Surrounded by or Protected by Dhamma.<br />
					And <i>anañña-sarana</i> again.<br />
					So I am saying: While 'Be an Island unto one's self' is nice, 'be the Dhamma unto one's self' doesn't fit, and there is the underlying theme of light, so mine.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Yoni yeva upaparikkhitabbo</i>. A phrase which seems to have undergone some 'reconstruction.' It means "thoroughly examine to the womb." However it's use broadened out into 'studious examination' period, and even out into just 'giving thorough attention'. The reader should note the difference which is made to the mental picture when translating "yoni" [womb] as "origin" versus leaving it as "womb." [indicated by square brackets below]:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">PALI:<br />
					Atta-dīpānaɱ bhikkhave, viharataɱ atta-saraṇānaɱ||<br />
					anañña-saraṇānaɱ Dhamma-dīpānaɱ Dhamma-saraṇānaɱ anañña-saraṇānaɱ, [yoni] yeva upaparikkhitabbo. Kiñjātikā soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'upāyāsā kiɱ pahotikā" ti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Woodward:<br />
					<i>By them who are islands unto themselves, brethren, who are a refuge unto themselves, who take refuge in none other who are islanded by the Norm, take refuge in the Norm, seek refuge in none other — by them the very [source] of things is to be searched for: thus — "What is the source of sorrow and grief, of woe, lamentation and despair? What is their origin?"</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Please note the way this is translated compared to the way it is usually presented here:<br />
					Here, beggars, the common man, not seeing Aristocrats, unwise to the Aristocratic Dhamma, untrained in the Aristocratic Dhamma, not seeing real men, unwise to the Dhamma of real men, untrained in the Dhamma of real men<br />
					Vs:<br />
					In the case of this case, beggars, we have the case of the untamed, untrained, uneducated common man. Untamed to the discipline of the aristocrats, untrained in the manners of the aristocrats, uneducated in the teachings of the aristocrats; untamed to the ways of the sappurisa, untrained in the craft of the sappurisa, uneducated to the lore of the sappurisa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first adheres closely to the Pali, the second shows the variety of <a id="meaningsofDhamma" href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm">meanings of Dhamma.</a> We could use a good translation for the term "<a id="Sappurisa">Sappurisa</a>." Some others are "puremen" "superman" "worthy ones."<br />
					"Purisa" is a term meaning "male" [pass up sun one], and "sapp-" means "clairified" as in butter, or gold. Interesting that our culture does not have a good word for a good man.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Rupa is translated by Woodward as "Body", which is a fairly standard interpretation. Here "material" is used because the meaning is broader and because there is another closer Pali word for body in "kaya" The broader meaning was likely intended because the discussion is of that which individuals consider their own or themselves. Some individuals conception of what material constitutes the self of them extends beyond (some beings out there think the whole world is their own!), or is less than the body [while it is in you, does excrement constitute a part of your idea of yourself or not? Is it a part of the body or not?].</p>
