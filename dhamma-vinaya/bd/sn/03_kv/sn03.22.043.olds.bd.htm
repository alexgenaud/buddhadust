					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Is it a light or is it an island? The word <i>"dipa"</i> means both and more.<br />
					<i>atta-dipa</i> can mean "self-islanded," or "self-lit" so: "Live as a light unto yourself" is, at the least, heard.<br />
					<i>atta-sarana</i> self surrounded, in the sense of "protected" and, also, self-recollected<br />
					<i>anañña-sarana [añña</i> &gt; <i>an</i> = not; <i>ya</i> = whatsoever; Latin <i>alius,</i> Gothic <i>aljis,</i> Old Anglo Saxon <i>elles</i> &gt; English else] Not other-surrounded or protected, but also "by nothing else protected. So it can be either way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Yoni yeva upaparikkhitabbo.</i> A phrase which seems to have undergone some 'reconstruction.' It means "thoroughly examine to the womb." However its use broadened out into 'studious examination' period, and even out into just 'giving thorough attention'. The reader should note the difference which is made to the mental picture when translating <i>"yoni"</i> [womb] as "origin" versus leaving it as "womb." [indicated by square brackets below]:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Pāḷi:<br />
					Atta-dīpānaṃ bhikkhave, viharataṃ atta-saraṇānaṃ||<br />
					anañña-saraṇānaṃ Dhamma-dīpānaṃ Dhamma-saraṇānaṃ anañña-saraṇānaṃ, [yoni] yeva upaparikkhitabbo. Kiñjātikā soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass'upāyāsā kiṃ pahotikā" ti.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Woodward:<br />
					<i>By them who are islands unto themselves, brethren, who are a refuge unto themselves, who take refuge in none other who are islanded by the Norm, take refuge in the Norm, seek refuge in none other — by them the very [source] of things is to be searched for: thus — "What is the source of sorrow and grief, of woe, lamentation and despair? What is their origin?"</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Please note the way this is translated compared to the way it is usually presented here:<br />
					Here, beggars, the common man, not seeing Aristocrats, unwise to the Aristocratic <i>Dhamma,</i> untrained in the Aristocratic <i>Dhamma,</i> not seeing real men, unwise to the <i>Dhamma</i> of real men, untrained in the <i>Dhamma</i> of real men<br />
					Vs:<br />
					In the case of this case, beggars, we have the case of the untamed, untrained, uneducated common man. Untamed to the discipline of the aristocrats, untrained in the manners of the aristocrats, uneducated in the teachings of the aristocrats; untamed to the ways of the <i>sappurisa,</i> untrained in the craft of the <i>sappurisa,</i> uneducated to the lore of the <i>sappurisa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first adheres closely to the <i>Pāḷi,</i> the second shows the variety of <a id="meaningsofDhamma" href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/dhamma.htm">meanings of <i>Dhamma.</i></a> We could use a good translation for the term "<a id="Sappurisa"><i>Sappurisa.</i></a>" Some others are "pure men" "superman" "worthy ones."<br />
					<i>"Purisa"</i> is a term meaning "male" [pass up sun one], and <i>"sapp-"</i> means "clarified" as in butter, or gold. Interesting that our culture does not have a good word for a good man.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Rūpa</i> is translated by Woodward as "Body", which is a fairly standard interpretation. Here "form" is used because the meaning is broader and because there is another closer <i>Pāḷi</i> word for body in <i>"kaya"</i> The broader meaning was likely intended because the discussion is of that which individuals consider their own or themselves. Some individuals conception of what form constitutes the self of them extends beyond (some beings out there think the whole world is their own!), or is less than the body [while it is in you, does excrement constitute a part of your idea of yourself or not? Is it a part of the body or not?].</p>
