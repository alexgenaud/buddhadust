<meta name="description" content="Samyutta Nikaya, Khandha Vagga, Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 79. Beginning with a discussion of what it is that one speaks of when one speaks of recollecting past lives, the Buddha then gives some detailed explanation of what is to be understood by shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness. Then speaking of these things as inconstant, painful and not self he describes the arahant as becoming disgsted at them and by that becoming free and by perceiving freedom in that freedom, reaching arahantship. Then further he describes such a one as one who neither heaps up or reduces, neither lets go nor takes up, neither scatters nor gathers." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>'kho'</i> then. 'At that time.' At the time when the form recalled came to be. This section is referring to the recollection of past lives, but in that all that which is encompassed by the term 'khandha' is of the past, it applies in all cases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Rūppatī.</i> Disrupture. There is word-play here with <i>'rūpa'</i> which Bhk. Bodhi has as: "form/deform' which passes for the meaning but does not work well in the follow-up examples. The matter should be understood as follows: It could be 'eruption/disruption' if we commonly held existing material to be an eruption out of (a form emerging from the uncreate) as it was in the old days. There is also a sexual connotation. (r u up pa-pa?) Various terms are used to define it and it's root 'rup' rupture, indicating 'to destroy' 'to break' and 'to disturb'. I think we can say that these terms are a secondary, subjective value judgment informing the neutral event of a shape emerging from a prior unbroken mass. PED would have it that this has no etymological relation to <i>Rūpa</i> in spite of this case here, (Woodward speculates that while <i>ruppati</i> comes from the root <i>'rup'</i> to damage; <i>rūpa</i> probably comes from the root <i>varp,</i> to shape, but <i>varp</i> is our 'warp' which is to damage; there is at least a common conception in back of both). What is the meaning? <i>Rūpa</i> is that which is distinguished from the background upon entering existence. First, light. Then Shapes formed from light. Then objects with other properties formed from the particulate or wave-form of those shapes. And so forth. So it alters, disrupts, ruptures, destroys or deforms or reforms or informs or warps or destroys or reformulates or reconfigures the previous undisturbed state.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Sañjānātī.</i> 'own-known'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Saɱkhataɱ abhisaɱkharontī</i> Own-made Conjured-up-own-making.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Vijānātī.</i> Re-cognized. To understand the relationship of this to our 'consciousness' you need to hear <i>viññāṇā</i> as I have sometimes translated it as 'double-knowing-knowing'. Consciousness as an individual (or which has been own-made) is really an illusion produced by an element-like phenomena of object-awareness that arises on the contact of a type of formed material known as a sense organ with another type of formed material known as an object of sense which has been perceived by still another type of formed-material-sense-organ known as a mind. Hense consciousness of an object is its having been known and then re-known as known. The Pali, being much closer to the point where words were initially being formed from observation of things is much clearer than our 'con sci (&gt;scīre to sense, to know) ous' 'with-knowing-ness'. OED: having the witness of one's own judgment or feelings, having the witness within oneself, knowing within oneself, inwardly sensible or aware. (Which assumes a self, where the Pali does not.)</p>
