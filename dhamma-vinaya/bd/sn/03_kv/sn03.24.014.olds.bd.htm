The Buddha states that the view that that which is the body is something other than that which is life arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of form, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and sense-consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky man,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anathapiṇḍika's Sporting Grounds.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding <i>"Bhante!"</i><br />
					The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>					

					<p class="f4">"There being what, beggars,<br />
					bound to what<br />
					adhering to what<br />
					does this view arise:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The self is one thing and the body is another'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					things are best resorted to<br />
					rooted in The Lucky Man,<br />
					channeled through The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					if further explanation of this point<br />
					were given by The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is said<br />
					by the Lucky Man<br />
					will be held in memory<br />
					by the beggars."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then give ear, beggars,<br />
					pay good attention!<br />
					I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, the beggars saying<br />
					"Even so, Bhante!"<br />
					in response,<br />
					the Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being form, beggars,<br />
					bound to form,<br />
					adhering to form,<br />
					even thus does this view arise:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The self is one thing and the body is another.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There being perception, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">There being consciousness, beggars,<br />
