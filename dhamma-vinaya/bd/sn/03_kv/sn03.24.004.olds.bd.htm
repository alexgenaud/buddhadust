					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding <i>"Bhante!"</i><br />
					The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us <i>Bhante,</i><br />

					<p class="f4">It would be good, <i>Bhante,</i><br />

					<p class="f4">That which is said<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then give ear, beggars,<br />
					pay good attention!<br />
					I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, the beggars saying<br />
					"Even so, Bhante!"<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> My translation leaves open whether or not the view-holder thinks further becoming is a good idea. The <i>Pāḷi</i> is:</p>
										
							<p class="in2"><i>No c'assaṃ||<br />
							no ca me siyā||<br />
							na bhavissami||<br />
							na me bhavissatī'</i>|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Woodward translates:</p>
										
							<p class="in2">'I may not be,<br />
							and mine it may not be.<br />
							I shall not be,<br />
							and mine it shall not be.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Bhikkhu Bodhi translates:</p>
										
							<p class="in2">I might not be,<br />
							and it might not be for me;<br />
							I will not be,<br />
							[and} it will not be for me.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Woodward's translation gives us a thinker who at first doubts his existance and then determines not to exist further. If he did not exist to begin with, there would be no need for him to end becoming. So it is self-contradictory and does not hang together. And further, doubting one's existence is not necessarily followed by the determination to end existence. As translated it makes sense only as a Buddhist view and that only with some previous explanation of why ending existence is a good idea! It looks like Woodward has jumped ahead to the Buddhist position here and that is not the point of the sutta. Bhikkhu Bodhi does the same thing.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation implies the same doubt but makes it a foregone conclusion that the thinker will not further become ("I will not be [and] ..." should be "were I not to become [no and] it would not become mine"), and so it has the same problem of not making good sense. Further, he accounts for the <i>"ca"</i> (usually "and"), but places it in the second phrase where in the original it is in the first. He footnotes commentary which says the <i>ca</i> should be thought of as "if", which I follow.</p>
