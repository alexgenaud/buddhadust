					<h1>The Bind-ups — Wrapped Up</h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the <i>Pāḷi</i><br />
               by<br />
               Michael M. Olds</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>In this sutta where it is translated:</p>

						<p class="in2">Woodward: "And what is body ... consciousness? It is these six seats of ... ";</p>

						<p class="in2">Bhk. Bodhi: "And what is form ... consciousness. There are these six classes of ...";</p>

						<p class="in2">Bhk. Thanissaro: "And what is form ... consciousness? These six classes of ...",</p>
						
					<p>what is being translated as "And what is ..." is <i>"Katamāñ ca x?",</i> and what is being translated as "seats of", "classes of", is <i>"x-kāyā".</i></p>
					
					<p>Normally translating <i>"Katamāñ ca x?",</i> as "And what is ..." does not create problems, but it should be heard in this case (and perhaps in every case for clarity) as it is in the <i>Pāḷi:</i></p>
					
					<p>"And what x?" (of x's, which is being spoken of here?) and <i>"x-kāyā"</i> (x-body), should be heard, so say I, as "embodied-form," ... emodied-consciousness".</p>
					
					<p>This needs to be the case in this case because there is, at least in the case of consciousness, consciousness which is not embodied, that is, that has not come into existence, has not become identified-with by an individual and does not need to be escaped from. As currently translated this leaves us with the idea that consciousness is to be annihilated and a contradiction in the Suttas where it is clearly pointed out (see —<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p53">SN 3.22.53</a>) that freed consciousness is <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<i>Sammā Diṭṭhi:</i> Consummate view:<br />
					[1] This is all painful ugly ukky k-kha.<br />
					[2] The source of that k-kha is hunger/thirst.<br />
					[3] To end the k-kha, end the hunger/thirst.<br />
					[4] This is the way: consummate view, consummate principles, consummate talk, consummate works, consummate lifestyle, consummate self-control, consummate mind, consummate serenity, consummate detachment.<br />
					<i>Sammā Sankappa:</i> Consummate Principles: let it go, inflict no mental harm, inflict no physical pain.<br /> 
					<i>Sammā Vaca:</i> Consummate Talk: let go of lies, malicious speech, gossip, slander, harsh speech.<br />
					<i>Sammā Kammanta:</i> Consummate Works: abstain from intentional taking of life, theft, giving up ethical conduct in the pursuit of pleasure; in one's commerce, mantras, or acts of thought, speech, or body.<br />
					<i>Sammā Ajiva:</i> Consummate Lifestyle: consummate Lifestyle is the style or process of living in accordance with this system. Identifying an element of one's lifestyle that is clearly seen by one's self as low, harmful, detrimental to one's self or others one abandons it, lets it go, drops it, renounces it,  restrains it, eradicates it.<br />
					<i>Sammā Vayama:</i> Consummate Self-control, restrain low conditions that are present in this visible thing, refrain from low conditions that are not yet present in this visible thing, retain high conditions that are present in this visible thing, and obtain high conditions that are not yet present in this visible thing.<br />
					<i>Sammā Sati:</i> Consummate Mind: Live in a body, in sensations, in the heart, and in the <i>Dhamma,</i> seeing bodies, sensations, the heart, and the <i>Dhamma,</i> as they really are, seeing how they come to be, seeing how they burn out, living above it all, without carelessness, insightful and calmed down, overcoming any hunger and thirst that may appear, downbound to nothing at all in the world.<br />
					<i>Sammā Samādhi:</i> Consummate Serenity: get high on the appreciation of the peace and calm of solitude, get high on getting high, get high with ease, on the sweet sensations of ease, get high off the all roun, clean clear through, bright shiny, radiance of detachment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Mahā-bhūtā.</i> Earth (solidity, harness, resistance), Water (liquidity, adhesion, gravity), Firelight (heat, light, knowledge), Wind (motion, animation, wave-form).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Āhāra.</i> Edible food, sense contact, heart-felt intention, and consciousness. Any of the four foods together with consciousness lead on to further becoming.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Vedanā.</i> This word has three meanings in translation: The experience of the Arahant, the sense-experience of the ordinary person, and the sensation experienced by the ordinary person: either pleasant, or unpleasant, or neither-unpleasant nor pleasant. Here what is being spoken of is sensation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Saññā.</i> Once-knowing. Almost a synonym for identification, it is the first identified knowledge of a thing: blue, red, yellow, loud, smokey, sweet, rough, interesting.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Saṅkhārā.</i> Identification with the intent to create sense-experience for the self through acts of mind, speech and body, and the identified-with object created. Personalization. Individualization. The creation of the personal world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Being much conditioned by familiarity with the <i>Paṭicca Samuppāda,</i> one might expect <i>avijja</i> or blindness here.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Viññāṇa.</i> Re-knowing-knowing-knowledge. Consciousness when we are speaking of individualized or sense-consciousness.
