					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>This kind of "Spell" is known as "A Wheel." In a wheel spell, two or more sets of concepts are "rolled-out" against each other until every possible combination has been used.</p>

					<p>These sorts of spells are an excellent place for beginning translators to concentrate, as, if one sticks closely to the Pali, the form is great medicine for getting rid of any wrongly used terms.</p>

					<p>Putting this the other way round: it is not likely one will get the words right just saying "The same but for x substitute y."</p>

					<p>First of all, there is almost always some slight change just where you have fallen asleep. The basic construction, for example, of the first ten of these suttas is (except for the one word change in form of 8,9,and 10) exactly the same except for the one concept that changes. Try constructing a translation this way! Then for the second ten again alter only one word by substituting one of the ten previous words and repeat the process, and so forth. One of those mathematicians or code breakers or CIA puzzle solvers ought to try their hand at this. It's mind-bending doing it at a computer where one can cut and paste, imagine the mental power of one that could hold this together in the mind!</p>

					<p>There needs to be a little introductory discussion of terminology here. Specifically concentrating on the words "jhaayati (<i>jhāna</i> practice)" and "<i>samadhi</i>"; the Pali for the first sutta in this spell (the one that sets the pattern) goes like this:</p>

					<p class="fp3 in2">Cattaro me bhikkhave jhāyī||<br />
					Katame cattāro?|| ||</p>

					<p class="fp3 in2">Idha, bhikkhave, ekacco jhāyī samādhismiɱ samādhikusalo hoti||<br />
					na samādhismiɱ samāpattikulalo|| ||<br />
					Idha pana bhikkhave ekacco jhāyī samādhismiɱ samāpattikusalo hoti||<br />
					na samādismiɱ samādhikusalo|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="Woodward">Woodward</a> gives us:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There are these four, brethren, who practise the <i>jhānas.</i><br />
					What four?<br />
					Herein, brethren, a certain one who practises meditation is skilled in concentration,<br />
					but is not skilled in the attainment thereof.<br />
					Again, brethren, a certain one who practises meditation is skilled in the attainments of concentration,<br />
					but is not skilled in concentration (itself) ... </p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu <a id="Bodhi">Bodhi</a> gives us:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of meditators.<br />
					What four?<br />
					Here, bhikkhus, a meditator is skilled in concentration regarding concentration<br />
					but not skilled in attainment regarding concentration.<br />
					Here a meditator is skilled in attainment regarding concentration<br />
					but not skilled in concentration regarding concentration ... </p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhu Bodhi footnotes:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Spk: Skilled in concentration (samaadhikusala): skilled in determining the factors thus, "The first jhaana has five factors, the second three factors," etc. But not skilled in attainment regarding concentration (no samaadhismi.m samaapattikusala): though he makes the mind pliant by gladdening it (Spk-pt: by removing the opposed states and collecting the cooperative causes), he is unable to attain the jhaana.<br />
					Mp III 354, on samaapattikusala: "Having collected suitable food and climate, he is skilled in attaining concentration — adroit, capable, and adept at it."<br />
					I doubt these explanations capture the intended meaning and think it more likely skill in attainment is synonymous with the "mastery in attainment" (samaapattivasii) described at Pa.tis I 100 thus: "He attains the first jhaana (etc) where, when, and for as long as he wishes; he has no difficulty in attaining."</p>

					<h4>Vocabulary:</h4>

					<p><b>jhāyati</b>: (1) (2 is to burn): PED notes: Sk. <i>dhyāyati,</i> dhi; with <i>dhīra, dhīh</i> from <i>didheti</i> shine, perceive; cp. Goth. filu-deisei cunning, &amp; in meaning <i>cinteti</i> &lt; <i>citta</i> 1. to meditate, contemplate, think upon, brood over; search for, hunt after  </p>

					<p><b>samādhi</b> [fr <i>saŋ +ā +dhā</i> (that would be "one's own"; to; dhā which is a sound essentially meaning the two things 'That' and 'Ahh' going to the request of the infant for the breast and the expression of satisfaction after feeding, so to "breast" "feeding" "nourishing" and "holding" "having" "possessing" and from there to "wealth" and "giving") This word is a "Manta" or Mantra or magic charm which yields much more information than this.  </p>

					<p>Bhante Punnaji hears <i><b>sama</b></i> 'even', and gets "equilibrium".  </p>

					<p>Those who translate this term as "concentration" are relying not so much on the word as on the definition of the <i>jhānas</i> in which one of the primary factors of the <i>jhānas</i> is "one pointedness of mind" (to be heard: "single-minded", "intent on one thing").</p>

					<p>PED has: 1. concentration; a concentrated, self-collected, intent state of mind and meditation . . . and points out how, in several ways, the term "<i>samādhi</i>" is far broader than our usual understanding that it is just meditation practice, and specifically the <i>jhānas</i>. For example: "In the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm">Ambattha-sutta</a> the ... terms are <i>sīla, caraṇa, vijja</i> (DN 3). Thus <i>samādhi</i> would comprise (a) the guarding of the senses <i>(indriyesu gutta-dvāratā),</i> (b) self-possession <i>(sati-sampajañña),</i> (c) contentment <i>(santuṭṭhi),</i> (d) emancipation from the 5 hindrances <i>(nivaranāni)</i> <i>and</i> (my 'and') (e) the 4 <i>jhānas.</i></p>

					<p>Again: Description and characterization of <i>samādhi:</i> Its four <i>nimittas</i> or signs are the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i> (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.044.horn.pts.htm#pg363">MN 44 Horner, p.363</a>); six conditions <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.072.hare.pts.htm">(AN 6.72)</a> and six hindrances <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/06_sixes/an06.073.hare.pts.htm">(AN 6.73 Hare)</a> other hindrances <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p128">(MN 128)</a>.</p>

					<p>References to "Two Grades of <i>samādhi</i>" the <i>upacara</i> (preparatory concentration) and <i>appana</i> (attainment concentration)" are confined to commentaries.</p>

					<p>The three kinds of <i>samadhi</i>:<br />
					1. <i>suññata;</i> empty<br />
					2. <i>appaṇihita;</i> aimless<br />
					3. <i>animitta;</i> signless.</p>

					<p>One more thing to factor in: In all likelihood the practice of meditation (sitting down (figuratively speaking) to attempt to rise above one's current mental state by abandoning it for another higher mental state) originated in inhaling marajuana (we hear of large stands (vana) waving too and fro in the hot summer winds rubbing against each other and catching fire ... many people gathering round to watch the blaze) or using <i>soma</i> (I believe <i>soma</i> is even sometimes called the milk of the gods...reference discussion of <i>"dhā"</i> above ... which I believe (in spite of scholarly studies which point to a mushroom) was  actually a sort of tea of marajuana resulting from boiling the flowers and leaves in milk) (Again, in this day and age it is necessary for me to make clear that I am not advocating drug use, and, quite the opposite, make the case that using drugs for the purposes of mental attainment is a flawed practice in that it neither teaches one the techniques for serenity, nor are it's effects lasting. Essentially, at it's best, it is an instructive experience which should serve to inspire one to personal (natural) effort and humble one who believes that the way they see things is the only way to see things.) With that out of the way, I say flat out that it is foolish, as a translator and as one struggling to understand this practice, to be ignoring this set of practices and it's vocabulary, and that is why I have here chosen the terms I use.</p>

					<p>So in just trying to figure out the translations for these two terms, what have we got here?</p>

					<p>All cases practice <i>jhāna,</i> or what I would understand to be the deliberate effort to cultivate mental brilliance or serenity (being above it all, being on top of things) or the ability to see and understand. This practice requires skills for it's development and has results which vary qualitatively.</p>

					<p>This practice results in or is amined at resulting in "getting" the state called <i>"samādhi". Jhāna</i> is the way to practice to attain <i>Samādhi.</i> Two different ideas, not synonyms.</p>

					<p>So I am saying what we have in <i>Sammā Samādhi</i> is what we have in all the other <i>Sammās:</i> 'The setting upright of what was upset' or, the defining of a set of 'best practices' (specifically in this system, practices which do not reflect "self" or clinging to that which belongs to "self") for major categories of common activities: "Everyone get's High. This is the Consummate way to Get High." Or, if you are going to Get High, <i>(samādhi)</i>, Practice your mental cultivation <i>(Jhāna)</i> this way.</p>

					<p>This is the only way this sutta doesn't result in such awk-pawk-pawk-word-nesses as:</p>

					<p>Woodward's: "one who practises meditation is skilled in the attainments of concentration, but is not skilled in concentration (itself)" or Bhikkhu Bodhi's entire construction.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>samāpattikusalo:</i> attainment-skills; There seem to be three categories here: skill at getting <i>samadhi</i>; the things which can be gained by <i>samadhi</i>, such as insight and calm; and things which are skills of <i>samadhi</i> or <i>jhāna</i> practice itself. The first person knows how to get high quickly and easily; the second may not have an easy time getting serenity, but gets the insights obtainable by serenity easily; the third may have trouble getting serenity, may have trouble using it to gain insight, but finds maintining it and developing it easy. I take this sutta to be dealing with this latter category.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>sappimaṇḍo:</i> I have never seen an authoritative statement as to what this is. In most PTS translations it is rendered (ahum) "skimmings of ghee" meaning, I think the froth which rises to the top when butter is heated in the clarification process. I think it may not be this, but the top part of ghee that has been at rest for a few hours where some additional separation of the milk solids has taken place (clarified ghee).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>ṭhiti:</i> to stand this; once having attained <i>jhāna</i>, the ability to keep it going. This (at least for the lower <i>jhānas)</i> is done by going back and starting again (focusing the mind once again on the breathing, for example) and by letting go.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>vuṭṭhāna:</i>&gt;<i>uṭṭhana</i>: rising, rise, getting up, standing opp. lying or sitting. This is the <i>ṭhāna</i> of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> where the conventional wisdom has this part of the word meaning "nourishment up" (the 'th' sound being the root for 'stand'; see #2); there are passages where the meaning of this term as used in this context is clear, as in when the process for going from a higher <i>jhāna</i> to a lower <i>jhāna</i> is described.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>kallavā:</i> wellness, properness; fitness, health; 2. clever, able, dextrous; 3. proper, right; 4. fitness, befitting</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>ārammaṇa:</i> PED: primary meaning "foundation", from this applied in the foll. senses: 1. support, help, footing, expedient, anything to be depended upon as a means of achieving what is desired, i.e. basis of operation, chance, 2. condition, ground, cause, means, 3. a basis for the working of the mind &amp; intellect; i.e. sense-object, object of thought or consciousness, the outward constituent in the relation of the subject and object, object in general. In this meaning of "relation" it is closely connected with <i>āyatana,</i> so that it sometimes takes its place. Bodhi follows the commentator in making this out to be the kasina (device used for initial establishement of concentration); I think this is correct, but a specific case of the general principle -- for different people there is a different "basis" for attaining each <i>jhāna</i> ... for some it may be a sound for other's a scent, etc. something about this object/thing has become associated with the entrance to the <i>jhāna</i> and can be made to trigger it. For some people this is done by deliberate intentional practice, as with a <i>kasina,</i> for others it happens naturally.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>gocaro:</i> cow-wanderound; familiarity with those areas where directing the mind is fruitful not those areas where it leads to coming down. Simple examples: don't think about sex or violence; think about the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>abhinīhāro:</i> PED: (&gt; <i>bhinirhāra:</i> taking the body out to burial) being bent on ("downward force") i.e. taking oneself out to, way of acting, (proper) behaviour, endeavor, resolve, aspiration. ABHI=over NI=down HARA=take, bring; this is the "Resolve" to have <i>jhāna</i> last so and so much time and then result in extraction. I wonder if there is not some confusion here with some old master speaking to our translator about resolve, understanding it to mean 'to bring to an end'. I am saying 'resolution' thinking of the "casting" of a spell, where it is like nourishment out on a journey and passing some stranger walking the other direction and then upon one's return one sees, at about the same spot, again going in the opposite direction that same stranger once again...the trip has a symmetry which is highly satisfying. I have mentioned this previously with regard to rising up out of sitting practice where I suggest that one have two or several objectives for the getting up -- so the symmetry would be in finding one's self at the completion of the objectives sitting down to take up practice again: there should be a similar symmetry in the <i>jhāna</i> practice as well.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>sakkaccang:</i> respectfully, carefully, duly, thoroughly &gt;sakkaroti &gt; to honor, esteem, treat with respect receive hospitably</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>sakkaccakārī</i> (the pattern changes here, "skillful" is replaced by <i>"kārī"</i> "doing" this is also something that I have seen a lot, almost as though to catch out those who would take shortcuts, there is often an unexpected twist. The meaning is that <i>jhāna</i> is treated as though it were an honored guest ... not "I am getting <i>jhāna</i>" but "<i>jhāna</i> has come for a visit ... let me make it welcome." Side note for those who would neglect training practices such as <i>Dāna: Dāna</i> and the lessons it provides is great training for treating <i>jhāna</i> hospitably.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Sātaccakari:</i> acting with perseverance. This means not only keeping at it when it is difficult, but also keeping at it during the long stretches where there is no progress evident at all and, even more diffult than either of these, keeping at it once one has reached some degree of progress.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>sappāyakari:</i> acting with suitability; not braging or otherwise showing off one's accomplishments (deadly to the practice; even just subjective self-congratulation or excitement will throw one off for long periods of time; for example, a small attainment and one then over-concentrates on what one thinks brought it about, etc., or "I got!" thought.).</p>
