<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.94. The Buddha takes the position that it is not he that argues with the world, but it is the world that argues with him, that he agrees with those who are worldly-wise who say 'there is not,' that is that there is any shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness which is constant, that he agrees with those who say 'it is' that is that shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness are simply pain. This he says he teaches and he dismisses those who hearing him so teach do not comprehend." />
