					<p class="f4"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></p>

					<p>The <i>Pāḷi</i> has been completely re-worked to reconcile it with the PTS version. This is one of the few cases where I have seen a difference in versions of the <i>Pāḷi</i> that could make a significant difference in understanding the message of a sutta. My new translation is my statement as to how I think it should be. There is a little bit of comedy here at the end where the various translators struggle with the fact that in the <i>Pāḷi</i> there is a sequence using <i>'attā'</i> or 'self': <i>vimuttattā ṭhitaṃ ṭhitattā santusitaṃ, santusitattā na paritassati</i> where they have used 'it' for 'self', so they have of consciousness, 'it' walking around liberated, steady, content, not troubled, and become cool. This is not technically wrong, but there needs to be some relaxation in the use of conventional speech in such cases. The beggar is being told about how to attain liberation, so there is no real problem about speaking of him, or his self, as having attained it. I have my own suggested solution as to how to handle this. This is really a sutta that deals with The First Lesson; food. Here sense-consciousness is shown as being dependent on a person's attachment to and taking up of form, sensation, perception, and own-making, and when that attachment is let go, how that takes the rug out from under sense-consciousness and results in consciousness being liberated.</p>

					<p>I have recently added "sense-" to "consciousness" where appropriate in this sutta where the <i>Pāḷi</i> only has <i>"viññāṇā"</i> ("consciousness"). This seemed to me to be necessary to indicate the two states of what we know of in English as "consciousness" which is used in the <i>Pāḷi</i> for both the ordinary consciousness and that of the arahant (as seen in this sutta). [I have more recently adopted a literal translation which can be heard both ways: "re-knowing-knowing-knowledge."</p>
