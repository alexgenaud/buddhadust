					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, Sāvatthi-town,<br />
					the <i>Bhagava</i> came a revisit'n.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, a certain beggar approached the Lucky Man<br />
					and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near<br />
					and exchanging greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side,<br />
					he asked the Lucky Man this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blindness, blindness' they say, <i>Bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent then, <i>Bhante,</i> is there being blind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, beggar the unread commoner<br />
					does not comprehend form,<br />
					does not comprehend the arising as self of form,<br />
					does not comprehend the ending of form,<br />
					does not comprehend the way to go to the ending of form;</p>

					<p class="f4">does not comprehend sense-experience,<br />
					does not comprehend the arising as self of sense-experience,<br />
					does not comprehend the ending of sense-experience,<br />
					does not comprehend the way to go to the ending of sense-experience;</p>

					<p class="f4">does not comprehend perception,<br />
					does not comprehend the arising as self of perception,<br />
					does not comprehend the ending of perception,<br />
					does not comprehend the way to go to the ending of perception;</p>

					<p class="f4">does not comprehend the own-made,<br />
					does not comprehend the arising as self of the own-made,<br />
					does not comprehend the ending of the own-made,<br />
					does not comprehend the way to go to the ending of the own-made;</p>

					<p class="f4">does not comprehend consciousness,<br />
					does not comprehend the arising as self of consciousness,<br />
					does not comprehend the ending of consciousness,<br />
					does not comprehend the way to go to the ending of consciousness.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">This, beggar, is the extent to which there is being blind."</p>
