					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, the Lucky Man,<br />
					Sāvatthi Town,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika Park<br />
					came-a ReVisiting,<br />
					and at that time BrokeTooth Tissa,<br />
					Gotama's cousin<br />
					said this to a number of Beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truth is, my friends,<br />
					its like my body is drugged,<br />
					the four directions are dim,<br />
					and the <i>Dhamma</i> is confusing to me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/thina-middha.htm">Lazy Ways and Inertia</a> overpower my Mind<br />
					and I am without <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/piti.htm">Enthusiasm</a> for the life.</p>

					<p class="f4">I fear I am falling away."</p>

					<p class="f4">At that, a number of those Beggars<br />
					went to The Lucky Man,<br />
					greeted him with closed palms,<br />
					and, sitting to one side, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhaggava, BrokeTooth Tissa,<br />
					the Bhaggava's cousin<br />
					has said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truth is, my friends,<br />
					its like my body is drugged,<br />
					the four directions are dim,<br />
					and the <i>Dhamma</i> is confusing to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lazy ways and inertia overpower my mind<br />
					and I am without enthusiasm for the Life.</p>

					<p class="f4">I fear I am falling away.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So then the Lucky Man motioned to a certain Beggar:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, Beggar,<br />
					go to Beggar Tissa and invite him,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Tissa, The Master wishes to speak with you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes BrokeTooth!" replied that Beggar,<br />
					and going to BrokeTooth Tissa, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Tissa, the Master wishes to speak with you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, Beggar!" said Tissa,<br />
					and coming to the Lucky Man,<br />
					greeted him with closed palms<br />
					and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So sitting, the Lucky Man said this to Tissa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">They say you said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truth is, my friends,<br />
					its like my body is drugged,<br />
					the four directions are dim,<br />
					and the <i>Dhamma</i> is confusing to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lazy ways and inertia overpower my mind<br />
					and I am without enthusiasm for the life.</p>

					<p class="f4">I fear I am falling away.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is true, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Tissa,<br />
					what do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">In form associated with lust,<br />
					associated with wanting,<br />
					associated with love,<br />
					associated with thirst,<br />
					associated with passion,<br />
					associated with (<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/tanha.htm">hunger),</a><br />
					is such form subject to setbacks and reversals,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is that, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa!</p>

					<p class="f4">And is it not the same with perception,<br />
					sense experience,<br />
					the personal world,<br />
					and consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Text is abridged here, and mixes up the order.]</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is that, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa!</p>

					<p class="f4">So then, Tissa, what do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">In form,<br />
					free from lust,<br />
					free from wanting,<br />
					free from love,<br />
					free from thirst,<br />
					free from passion,<br />
					free from hunger,<br />
					is such form subject to setbacks and reversals,<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain and misery?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa!</p>

					<p class="f4">And is it not the same with perception,<br />
					sense experience,<br />
					the personal world,<br />
					and consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is that, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa!</p>

					<p class="f4">So then, Tissa, what do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form unchanging or changeable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Changeable, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is it with perception,<br />
					sense experience,<br />
					the personal world<br />
					and consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Unchangeable or changeable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Changeable, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So seeing, Tissa,<br />
					the well tamed,<br />
					well trained,<br />
					well educated student of the Aristocrats<br />
					disassociates from form,<br />
					disassociates from perception,<br />
					disassociates from sense experience,<br />
					disassociates from a world of his own,<br />
					disassociates from consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disassociated, he does not Lust after it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting after it, he is freed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom he sees freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom seeing freedom he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am Free!'<br />
					and has penetrating knowledge that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jati.htm">Rebirth</a> has been left behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived is the best life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Done is duty's doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">No more being any kind of an "it" at any place of being "at" for me!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, Tissa, two men:<br />
					one unskilled about the way,<br />
					and the other skilled as to <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm">the way.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The one who is unskilled<br />
					asks directions of the one who is skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one skilled as to the way answers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the way, Good Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">Go on a little further on this way,<br />
					and when you see the way divide,<br />
					leave the left hand way<br />
					and take the right hand way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go on a little further on this way,<br />
					and you will come to a deep forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Keep going on a little further on this way<br />
					and you will come to a swamp.</p>

					<p class="f4">Keep going on a little further on this way<br />
					and you will come to a cliff.</p>

					<p class="f4">Keep going on a little further on this way<br />
					and you will reach a pleasant patch of high ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Tissa, is the meaning of the parable I have devised:</p>

					<p class="f4">By 'one unskilled about the way' is meant, the untamed, untrained, uneducated common man.</p>

					<p class="f4">By 'one Skilled as to the way' is meant the <i>Tathāgata</i>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#VeryPowerfulIndividuals">Arahato</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#VeryPowerfulIndividuals"><i>Sammā-sambuddhassa.</i></a></p>

					<p class="f4">By 'seeing the way divide' is meant <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vicikiccha.htm">doubt.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">'The left hand way' means the way contrary to the way.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The right hand way' is a name for The Aristocratic Multidimensional Way, that is:<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">High Views</a>,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankappa.htm">High Principles,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vaca.htm">High Talk,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kammanta.htm">High Works,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ajiva.htm">High Lifestyle,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vayama.htm">High Self Control,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_satipatthana.htm">High Mind,</a> and<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm">High Serenity.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The 'deep forest' is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/avijja.htm">blindness</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The 'swamp' is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/tanha.htm">desire.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The 'cliff' is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vyapada.htm">dashed-hope-anger</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'A pleasant patch of high ground,' is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nibbana.htm"><i>Nibbāna.</i></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Be well, Tissa!</p>

					<p class="f4">Be well, Tissa!</p>

					<p class="f4">I have instructed you.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have assisted you.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have spoken to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Bhaggava<br />
					and the BrokeTooth Tissa was given peace of mind<br />
					and made happy<br />
					as a consequence of what the Bhaggava said.</p>
