					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, the Lucky Man, Sāvatthi Town, Anāthapiṇḍika Park came-a ReVisiting, and at that time BrokeTooth Tissa, Gotama's cousin said this to a number of Beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truth is, my friends, it's like my body is drugged, the four directions are dim, and the Dhamma is confusing to me. <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/thina-middha.htm">Lazy Ways and Inertia</a> overpower my Mind and I am without <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/piti.htm">Enthusiasm</a> for the Life. I fear I am falling away."</p>

					<p class="f4">At that, a number of those Beggars went to The Lucky Man, greeted him with closed palms, and, sitting to one side, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhaggava, BrokeTooth Tissa, the Bhaggava's cousin has said this: 'Truth is, my friends, it's like my body is drugged, the four directions are dim, and the Dhamma is confusing to me. Lazy Ways and Inertia overpower my Mind and I am without Enthusiasm for the Life. I fear I am falling away.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So then the Lucky Man motioned to a certain Beggar: "Come here, Beggar, go to Beggar Tissa and ask him to come, saying: 'Friend Tissa, The Master wishes to speak with you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes BrokeTooth!" replied the Beggar, and going to BrokeTooth Tissa, he said: "Friend Tissa, the Master wishes to speak with you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, Beggar!" said Tissa, and coming to the LuckyMan, greeted him with closed palms and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So sitting, the LuckyMan said this to Tissa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, Tissa? They say you said: 'Truth is, my friends, it's like my body is drugged, the four directions are dim, and the Dhamma is confusing to me. Lazy Ways and Inertia overpower my Mind and I am without Enthusiasm for the Life. I fear I am falling away.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is true, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Tissa, what do you think? In Material associated with Lust, associated with wanting, associated with love, associated with thirst, associated with passion, associated with (<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/tanha.htm">hunger</a>), is such Material subject to setbacks and reversals, Grief and Lamentation, Pain and Misery?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is that, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa! And is it not the same with Perception, Sense Experience, The Personal World, and Consciousness? [Text abbreviates here, and mixes up the order.]"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is that, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa! So then, Tissa, what do you think? Is Material free from Lust, free from wanting, free from love, free from thirst, free from passion, free from hunger, is such Material subject to setbacks and reversals, Grief and Lamentation, Pain and Misery?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa! And is it not the same with Perception, Sense Experience, the Personal World, and Consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is that, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Tissa! So then, Tissa, what do you think? Is Material unchanging or changeable?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Changeable, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is it with Perception, Sense Experience, the Personal World and Consciousness? Unchangeable or Changeable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Changeable, Bhaggava."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So seeing, Tissa, the well tamed, well trained, well educated student of the Aristocrats Disassociates from Material, disassociates from Perception, disassociates from Sense Experience, disassociates from A World of His Own, disassociates from Consciousness. Disassociated, he does not Lust after it. Not lusting after it, he is freed. In freedom he sees freedom. In freedom seeing freedom he knows: "I am Free!" and has Penetrating knowledge that: "<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/jati.htm">Rebirth</a> has been left behind. Lived is the Best Life. Done is Duty's doing. No more being any kind of an "it" at any place of being "at" for me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, Tissa, two men: one unskilled about the way, and the other skilled as to <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm">The Way</a>. The one who is unskilled asks directions of the one who is skilled. The one Skilled as to The Way answers: 'This is the Way, Good Man: Go on a little further on This Way, and when you see the way divide, leave the left hand way and take the right hand way. Go on a little further on This Way, and you will come to a Deep Forest. Keep going on a little further on This Way and you will come to a Swamp. Keep going on a little further on This Way and you will come to a Cliff. Keep going on a little further on This Way and you will reach a pleasant patch of high ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Tissa, is the meaning of the parable I have devised:</p>

					<p class="f4">By "one unskilled about the way" is meant, the untamed, untrained, uneducated common man.</p>

					<p class="f4">By "one Skilled as to The Way" is meant the Tathāgata, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#VeryPowerfulIndividuals">Arahato</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#VeryPowerfulIndividuals">Sammasambuddhassa</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">By "seeing the way divide" is meant <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vicikiccha.htm">Doubt</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The left hand way" means the way contrary to the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The right hand way" is a Name for The Aristocratic Multidimensional Way, that is:<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">High Views</a>,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankappa.htm">High Principles,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vaca.htm">High Talk,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kammanta.htm">High Works,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ajiva.htm">High Lifestyle,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vayama.htm">High Self Control,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_satipatthana.htm">High Mental Preparation,</a> and<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samadhi.htm">High Getting High.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The "Deep Forest" is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/avijja.htm">Blindness</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The "Swamp" is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/tanha.htm">Desire.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The "Cliff" is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vyapada.htm">Dashed-hope-anger</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">"A pleasant patch of high ground," is a name for <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nibbana.htm">Nibbāna.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Be well, Tissa! Be well, Tissa! I have instructed you. I have assisted you. I have spoken to you. </p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Bhaggava and the BrokeTooth Tissa was given peace of mind and made happy as a consequence of what the Bhaggava said.</p>
