					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town residing:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one time there the Ancient Radha drew near Bhagava,<br />
					gave salutation, and took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, so seated, the Ancient Radha said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mara! Mara!" is the expression<br />
					to what extent, bhante, can there be said to be Mara?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Form, Radha, there is Mara, or death or suchas dies.<br />
					Therefore, Radha, you should see Form as Mara, see it as death, see it as suchas dies, see it as disease, see it as a boil, see it as an arrowhead, see it as the forefront of woe, see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Sense Experience, Radha, there is Mara, or death or suchas dies.<br />
					Therefore, Radha, you should see Sense Experience as Mara, see it as death, see it as suchas dies, see it as disease, see it as a boil, see it as an arrowhead, see it as the forefront of woe, see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Perception, Radha, there is Mara, or death or suchas dies.<br />
					Therefore, Radha, you should see Perception as Mara, see it as death, see it as suchas dies, see it as disease, see it as a boil, see it as an arrowhead, see it as the forefront of woe, see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Own-making, Radha, there is Mara, or death or suchas dies.<br />
					Therefore, Radha, you should see Own-making as Mara, see it as death, see it as suchas dies, see it as disease, see it as a boil, see it as an arrowhead, see it as the forefront of woe, see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Consciousness, Radha, there is Mara, or death or suchas dies.<br />
					Therefore, Radha, you should see Consciousness as Mara, see it as death, see it as suchas dies, see it as disease, see it as a boil, see it as an arrowhead, see it as the forefront of woe, see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">But "high seeing," bhante, what is the point of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of high seeing, Radha, is indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">But "indifference," bhante, what is the point of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of indifference, Radha is dispassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">But "dispassion," bhante, what is the point of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of dispassion, Radha is freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">But "freedom," bhante, what is the point of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The point of freedom, Radha, is Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">But "Nibbāna," bhante, what is the point of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the question, Radha! But a question unansurable within graspable limits. Indeed it is for a ford to Nibbāna, Radha, that one lives the Godly life, Nibbāna is the ultimate end, Nibbāna is the final conclusion.</p>
