					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town residing:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one time there the Ancient Radha drew near Bhagava,<br />
					gave salutation,<br />
					and took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, so seated,<br />
					the Ancient Radha said this to Bhagava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Mara! Mara!'" is the expression.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent, bhante, can there be said to be Mara?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Form, Radha,<br />
					there is Mara,<br />
					or death<br />
					or suchas dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Radha, you should see Form as Mara,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as suchas dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Sense Experience, Radha,<br />
					there is Mara,<br />
					or death<br />
					or suchas dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Radha, you should see Sense Experience as Mara,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as suchas dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Perception, Radha, there is Mara,<br />
					or death<br />
					or suchas dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Radha, you should see Perception as Mara,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as suchas dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is own-making, Radha, there is Mara,<br />
					or death<br />
					or suchas dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Radha, you should see own-making as Mara,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as suchas dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is Consciousness, Radha, there is Mara,<br />
					or death<br />
					or suchas dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Radha, you should see Consciousness as Mara,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as suchas dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are high seeing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'high seeing,' bhante, what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of high seeing, Radha, is indifference."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'indifference,' bhante, what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of indifference, Radha is dispassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'dispassion,' bhante, what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of dispassion, Radha is freedom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'freedom,' bhante, what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of freedom, Radha, is Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'Nibbāna,' bhante, what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is the question, Radha!</p>

					<p class="f4">But a question unansurable within graspable limits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is for a ford to Nibbāna, Radha,<br />
					that one lives the Godly life,<br />
					Nibbāna is the ultimate end,<br />
					Nibbāna is the final conclusion.</p>
