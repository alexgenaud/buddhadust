					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time in Sāvatthi-town the Bhagava came a revisit'n,<br />
					and there, to the Beggars gathered round he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, beggars, a roaring river,<br />
					it's swift stream tearing down the treacherous cliffs<br />
					from its origins in the high mountains,<br />
					it might be that clinging to the bank,<br />
					kasa grass is growing,<br />
					bending towards the opposing bank;<br />
					just hanging on there,<br />
					or it might be that kusa grass is growing,<br />
					just hanging on there;<br />
					or it might be that reeds are growing,<br />
					just hanging on there;<br />
					or it might be that sweet-smelling grasses are growing,<br />
					just hanging on there;<br />
					or it might be that some tree is growing,<br />
					just hanging on there;<br />
					And here comes, some man,<br />
					being carried down by that stream,<br />
					grabbing after that kasa grass,<br />
					but it just breaks away,<br />
					and because of that he is downbound<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grabs after that kusa grass,<br />
					grabs after those reeds,<br />
					grabs after those sweet-smelling grasses,<br />
					grabs after that tree,<br />
					but they just break away,<br />
					and because of that he is downbound,<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars, the uneducated common man,<br />
					not seeing aristocrats,<br />
					unwise to the aristocratic dhamma,<br />
					untrained in the aristocratic dhamma,<br />
					not seeing real men,<br />
					unwise to the dhamma of real men,<br />
					untrained in the dhamma of real men,<br />
					holds on to matter as the self;<br />
					self as having produced matter;<br />
					self as within matter;<br />
					matter as within self;<br />
					but then matter breaks away,<br />
					and because of that he is downbound,<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds on to sense experience,<br />
					holds on to perception,<br />
					holds on to the own-made world,<br />
					holds on to consciousness,<br />
					but then consciousness breaks away,<br />
					and because of that he is downbound,<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, beggars?<br />
					Does matter change or is it unchanging?</p>

					<p class="f4">It changes, Bhante.</p>

					<p class="f4">And sense experience?<br />
					Perception?<br />
					The own-made world?<br />
					Consciousness; do those things change, or are they unchanging?</p>

					<p class="f4">They change, Bhante.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore beggars<br />
					whatever matter there is,<br />
					past, future or present,<br />
					personal or external,<br />
					tangible or intangible,<br />
					inferior or superior,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far off or near by,<br />
					all matter whatsoever<br />
					should be seen with consummate wisdom<br />
					as it really is as:<br />
					'Not mine; not me; not the self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever sense experiences,<br />
					whatever perceptions,<br />
					whatever own-made world<br />
					whatever consciousness there is,<br />
					past, future or present,<br />
					personal or external,<br />
					tangible or intangible,<br />
					inferior or superior,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far off or near by,<br />
					all consciousness whatsoever<br />
					should be seen with consummate wisdom<br />
					as it really is as:<br />
					'Not mine; not me; not the self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, beggars,<br />
					the well-taught student of the aristocrats<br />
					is disgusted with matter,<br />
					sense experience,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the own-made world<br />
					and consciousness;<br />
					disgusted he is without passion for;<br />
					freed from passion,<br />
					he is free;<br />
					free he knows:<br />
					"Left behind is birth;<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more this side or that,<br />
					no more it'n-n-at'n for me!'</p>
