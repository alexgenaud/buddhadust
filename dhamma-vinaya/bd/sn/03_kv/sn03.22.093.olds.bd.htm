					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time in Sāvatthi-town<br />
					the <i>Bhagava</i> came a revisit'n,<br />
					and there,<br />
					to the Beggars gathered round<br />
					he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Imagine, beggars, a roaring river,<br />
					its swift stream tearing down the treacherous cliffs<br />
					from its origins in the high mountains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It might be that clinging to the bank,<br />
					kasa grass is growing,<br />
					bending towards the opposing bank;<br />
					just hanging on there,</p>

					<p class="f4">or it might be that reeds are growing,<br />
					just hanging on there;</p>

					<p class="f4">or it might be that sweet-smelling grasses are growing,<br />
					just hanging on there;</p>

					<p class="f4">or it might be that some tree is growing,<br />
					just hanging on there.</p>

					<p class="f4">And here comes, some man,<br />
					being carried down by that stream,<br />
					grabbing after that kusa grass,<br />
					but it just breaks away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And because of that he is downbound<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grabs after that kusa grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grabs after those reeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grabs after those sweet-smelling grasses.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grabs after that tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">But they just break away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And because of that he is downbound,<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, beggars,<br />
					the uneducated common man,<br />
					not seeing aristocrats,<br />
					unwise to the aristocratic <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					untrained in the aristocratic <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					not seeing real men,<br />
					unwise to the <i>Dhamma</i> of real men,<br />
					untrained in the <i>Dhamma</i> of real men,<br />
					holds on to form as the self;<br />
					self as having produced form;<br />
					self as within form;<br />
					form as within self.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then form breaks away,<br />
					and because of that he is downbound,<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds on to sense experience,<br />
					holds on to perception,<br />
					holds on to the own-made world,<br />
					holds on to consciousness,<br />
					but then consciousness breaks away,<br />
					and because of that he is downbound,<br />
					one who meets destruction and misery.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, beggars?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does form change or is it unchanging?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It changes, Bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And sense experience?</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">The own-made world?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness</p>

					<p class="f4">Do those things change,<br />
					or are they unchanging?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They change, Bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore beggars<br />
					whatever form there is,<br />
					past, future or present,<br />
					personal or external,<br />
					tangible or intangible,<br />
					inferior or superior,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far off or near by,<br />
					all form whatsoever<br />
					should be seen with consummate wisdom<br />
					as it really is as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not mine;<br />
					not me;<br />
					not the self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever sense experiences,<br />
					whatever perceptions,<br />
					whatever own-made world<br />
					whatever consciousness there is,<br />
					past, future or present,<br />
					personal or external,<br />
					tangible or intangible,<br />
					inferior or superior,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far off or near by,<br />
					all consciousness whatsoever<br />
					should be seen with consummate wisdom<br />
					as it really is as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not mine;<br />
					not me;<br />
					not the self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, beggars,<br />
					the well-taught student of the aristocrats<br />
					is disgusted with form,<br />
					sense experience,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the own-made world<br />
					and consciousness;<br />
					disgusted,<br />
					he is without passion for;<br />
					freed from passion,<br />
					he is free;<br />
					free he knows:<br />
					'Left behind is birth;<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no more this side or that,<br />
					no more it'n-n-at'n for me!'"</p>
