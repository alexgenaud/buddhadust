					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					was Sāvatthi-town,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br />
					revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time there had come into the mind<br />
					of a certain beggar name-a Yamaka<br />
					the following point of view:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how I understand the <i>Dhamma</i> as taught by the Buddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">If a Beggar has destroyed the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas,</i></a><br />
					at the break up of the elements at death,<br />
					he has reached his end<br />
					and becomes non existent."</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point<br />
					he is questioned by his fellow Beggars<br />
					and they are unable to dissuade him from this view<br />
					and he is brought to Sāriputta<br />
					who asks him if it is true<br />
					that he holds this view.</p>

					<p class="f4">He admits that he does,<br />
					and he is subjected to the following interview:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now then, friend Yamaka,<br />
					what do you think about this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Is <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/kaya.htm">body</a> permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent."</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vedana.htm">sense-experience</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanna.htm">perception</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankhara.htm">own-making,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vinnana.htm">consciousness?"</a></p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And that which is impermanent;<br />
					is that properly regarded as painful or pleasant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Painful."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And that which is painful,<br />
					is that properly regarded<br />
					as being the self<br />
					or belonging to the self<br />
					or being that in which the self is to be found<br />
					or being that which is to be found<br />
					as a part within the self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not to be so regarded."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So then is it not the case<br />
					that one who sees it this way<br />
					knows that there is no further prospect<br />
					of life identified with these conditions?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is true."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, then, let me ask you:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup> as body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i> as sense-experience,<br />
					or perception,<br />
					or own-making<br />
					or consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as something other than body,<br />
					or sense-experience,<br />
					or perception,<br />
					or own-making<br />
					or consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as inside the body somewhere?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as possessing the body somewhere in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as inside the sense-experiences somewhere?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as possessing the sense-experiences somewhere in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as inside perception somewhere?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as possessing perception somewhere in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as inside own-making somewhere?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as possessing own-making somewhere in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as inside consciousness somewhere?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as possessing consciousness somewhere in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">"None of these."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as being body<br />
					and sense-experience<br />
					and perception<br />
					and own-making<br />
					and consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					as not having body,<br />
					sense-experience,<br />
					perception,<br />
					own-making,<br />
					or consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So then, friend Yamaka,<br />
					you are saying that<br />
					right here and now<br />
					the <i>Tathāgata</i> is not to be regarded<br />
					as existing in ultimate reality,<br />
					so how is it proper for you to assert that<br />
					'If a Beggar has destroyed the <i>āsavas,</i> at the break up of the elements at death, he has reached his end and becomes non existent'?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>'The That-that-got-that', lower case "t". Here it is clear that what is being spoken of is not The Buddha, but any person who has destroyed the <i>āsavas.</i></p>
