					<p>The stockpiles are one of the ways in which the Buddha has broken into smaller units everything in existence. The distinction between the stockpiles and the fuel-stockpiles is that the fuel stockpiles are, as the name indicates, stockpiles turned into fuel by the corrupting influences of lust, existence and blindness. In other words they have become the objects of the intent to experience sense-pleasures, existence, or the product of some point of view. The distinction is very clearly drawn in this sutta, but is it correct to draw the conclusion that it is saying that the <i>khandhas</i> exist separately from individuality? Identifying with the <i>khandhas,</i> or one of them, or holding opinions about the self (as per the previous sutta) they are <i>upadana-k-khandha;</i> seen externally, objectively, they are just <i>khandha.</i> When the <i>āsavas</i> (corrupting influences: lust, existence and blindness) have been destroyed in the living Arahant, the <i>khandhas</i> are seen to carry on for the remainder of the lifespan of the being who became arahant. Subsequent to the 'visible' death of the Arahant, the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness <i>dhatu</i> break apart, separate off and he makes no further <i>khandhas</i> the object of intent to experience sensory existence and for him without such intent, because he has destroyed the <i>āsavas,</i> do not arise again. So from two perspectives (the living arahant, and the separation from body, etc. of the living being from the <i>khandhas</i> at death) we can see that there is a distinction between <i>khandhas</i> that are fuel and those that are no longer fueled, but we cannot say that there is any sustained or autonomous existence of the <i>khandhas</i> separate from individuality.</p>
