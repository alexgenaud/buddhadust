<meta name="description" content="M. Olds' translation of Samyutta Nikaya III: Khandha Vagga, Samyutta 22: Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 47. Whoever holds opinions concerning the self does so with the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness in mind. With one or another of these things giving rise to thoughts of 'I am' or 'it is', there arises experience through the six senses and with the experience, the conviction that these things exist. Seeing this as it is, it can be let go and those convictions disappear." />

					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, the Lucky Man,<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-Town,</a><br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br />
					came-a ReVisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Bhante!"</i> they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever shaman or Brahmin there are, beggars,<br />
					who lay out various observations<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> concerning self,<br />
					observe it as the five fuel-stockpiles,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or observe it as one or another of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, the uneducated commoner,<br />
					not seeing the Aristocratic,<br />
					untamed by the Aristocratic <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					untrained in the Aristocratic <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					not seeing the good men,<br />
					untamed by the good man' <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					untrained in the good man' <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					observes: 'Form is self,' or<br />
					'Self has form,' or<br />
					'Self is in form,' or<br />
					'Form is in self';</p>

					<p class="f4">observes: 'Sense experience is self,' or<br />
					'Self has sense experience,' or<br />
					'Self is in sense experience,' or<br />
					'Sense experience is in self';</p>

					<p class="f4">observes: 'Perception is self,' or<br />
					'Self has perception,' or<br />
					'Self is in perception,' or<br />
					'Perception is in self';</p>

					<p class="f4">observes: 'Own-making is self,' or<br />
					'Self has own-making,' or<br />
					'Self is in own-making,' or<br />
					'Own-making is in self';</p>

					<p class="f4">observes: 'Sense-consciousness is self,' or<br />
					'Self has sense-consciousness,' or<br />
					'Self is in sense-consciousness,' or<br />
					'Sense-consciousness is in self'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus these observations<br />
					as well as<br />
					'I am'<br />
					are not done away with.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, beggars,<br />
					'I am' not done away with,<br />
					there comes descent into the five forces:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					eye-force,<br />
					ear-force,<br />
					nose-force,<br />
					tongue-force,<br />
					body-force.</p>

					<p class="f4">There beggars, you have mind,<br />
					there you have things<br />
					there you have a description of blindness.</p>

					<p class="f4">With contact with contact-born blindness, beggars,<br />
					in the uneducated commoner the experience of<br />
					just this very 'I am' is had,<br />
					just this very 'This I am' is had,<br />
					just this very 'Existence is'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is had,<br />
					just this very 'Form exists' is had,<br />
					just this very 'Formlessness exists' is had,<br />
					just this very 'Perception exists' is had,<br />
					just this very 'Non-perception exists' is had,<br />
					just this very 'Neither-perception-nor-non-perception exists' is had.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right there then, beggars,<br />
					are established the five forces.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is right here then, beggars,<br />
					that in the well educated student of the aristocratic,<br />
					letting go of blindness,<br />
					vision arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the disappearance of blindness,<br />
					the arising of vision,<br />
					just this very 'I am' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'This I am' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'Existence is' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'Form exists' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'Formlessness exists' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'Perception exists' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'Non-perception exists,' is not had,<br />
					just this very 'Neither-perception-nor-non-perception exists' is not had."</p>

Observing. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro translates 'assume' here but this causes him a problem when dealing with the sentence: <i>"Iti ayañc'eva samanupassanā 'asmī' ti c'assa avigataṃ hoti."</i> making him insert the term 'understanding' which is not there. <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi has a similar problem translating the term as 'regarding'. He handles it thus: "Thus this way of regarding things and [the notion] 'I am' have not vanished in him. Woodward, also using 'regard' translates the sentence: "Thus this is the view: — it has come to him (to think) "I am". My solution, uses the double meaning found in 'observe' (to see and to hold or state an opinion) solves the problem.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Upādāna-k-khandha.</i> The difficulty of understanding this term and the early translation as 'grasping' by the PTS translators has caused no end of difficulty in understanding this compound. The problem originates with the mental bias that attempts to make the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> a straight-line cause-and-effect progression which requires some sort of logical link between thirst and being. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's research into the term uncovers a more reasonable solution in the literal idea of 'fuel' and figurative understanding that this means that which supports. When we see how neatly 'fueling' mates up with 'stockpile' (for <i>khandha</i>) we can see the correctness of this understanding. It can be understood even more clearly if translating <i>'khandha'</i> as 'trunk' where we can see a woodpile there. Stockpile of fuel.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>Indriyani.</i></a> PED: <i>Indriya</i> (nt.)

On term: <i>Indriya</i> is one of the most comprehensive and important categories of Buddhist psychological philosophy and ethics, meaning "controlling principle, directive force, élan, <i>δύναμις",</i>" Using 'force' I am attempting to show how the senses, their objects and consciousness are objective entities divorced from the individual, like the tides of the oceans, or gravity. The common translation is 'faculties' which has the disadvantage of implying their derivation from the individual (the view: 'the sense spheres are in the self") rather than the fact that the sense-spheres enter the picture upon the establishment of the notion of self in connection with consciousness. Upon own-making (<i>sankhārā</i>) consciousness arises. That consciousness is experienced as (has as its object) awareness of sense-experience as personal experience.</p>
