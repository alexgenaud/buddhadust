					<p class="f4">Once upon a time the Lucky Man<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#benares">Benares</a> residing,<br />
					The Deer Park,<br />
					Seer's Landing.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the The Lucky Man said this to the Group of Five beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Bhante!"</i> they replied,</p>

					<p class="f4">and the Lucky Man said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Form, beggars: not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if form, beggars, were self,<br />
					it would follow<br />
					that there would not be oppression from form,<br />
					and of form it would be possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my form be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my form not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">However, beggars, form: not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore of form<br />
					it follows<br />
					that there is oppression from form,<br />
					and of form it is not possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my form be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my form not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-experience, beggars: not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if sense-experience, beggars, were self,<br />
					it would follow<br />
					that there would not be oppression from sense-experience,<br />
					and of sense-experience it would be possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my sense-experience be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my sense-experience not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">However, beggars, sense-experience: not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore of sense-experience<br />
					it follows<br />
					that there is oppression from sense-experience,<br />
					and of sense-experience it is not possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my sense-experience be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my sense-experience not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-perception, beggars: not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if sense-perception, beggars, were self,<br />
					it would follow<br />
					that there would not be oppression from sense-perception,<br />
					and of sense-perception it would be possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my sense-perception be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, beggars, sense-perception: not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore of sense-perception<br />

					<p class="f4">Own-making, beggars: not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if own-making, beggars, were self,<br />
					it would follow<br />
					that there would not be oppression from own-making,<br />
					and of own-making it would be possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my own-making be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my own-making not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">However, beggars, own-making: not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore of own-making<br />
					it follows<br />
					that there is oppression from own-making,<br />
					and of own-making it is not possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my own-making be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my own-making not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense-consciousness, beggars: not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if sense-consciousness, beggars, were self,<br />
					it would follow<br />

					<p class="f4">Let my sense-consciousness not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">However, beggars, sense-consciousness: not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore of sense-consciousness<br />

					and of sense-consciousness it is not possible to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my sense-consciousness be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my sense-consciousness not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, beggars?</p>

					<p class="f4">Form: stable or unstable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Unstable, bhante"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is unstable:<br />
					painful or pleasant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Painful, bhante."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is unstable,<br />
					painful,<br />
					a distorted thing,<br />
					is it reasonable to have of such the view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine,'<br />
					I am this,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Unstable, bhante"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, beggars:<br />
					whatever there is of form<br />
					past, future, present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					material or immaterial;<br />
					discarded or exalted;<br />
					romote or nearby;<br />
					of all form:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<br />
					I am not this,<br />
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that it should be seen<br />
					as it is<br />
					with the highest wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, beggars:<br />
					whatever there is of sense-experience<br />
					past, future, present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					material or immaterial;<br />
					discarded or exalted;<br />
					romote or nearby;<br />
					of all sense-experience:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<br />
					I am not this,<br />
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that it should be seen<br />
					as it is<br />
					with the highest wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, beggars:<br />
					whatever there is of sense-perception<br />
					past, future, present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					material or immaterial;<br />
					discarded or exalted;<br />
					romote or nearby;<br />
					of all sense-perception:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<br />
					I am not this,<br />
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that it should be seen<br />
					as it is<br />
					with the highest wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, beggars:<br />
					whatever there is of own-making<br />
					past, future, present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					material or immaterial;<br />
					discarded or exalted;<br />
					romote or nearby;<br />
					of all own-making:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<br />
					I am not this,<br />
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that it should be seen<br />
					as it is<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore, beggars:<br />
					whatever there is of sense-consciousness<br />
					be it past, future, present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					material or immaterial;<br />
					discarded or exalted;<br />
					romote or nearby;<br />
					of all sense-consciousness:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<br />
					I am not this,<br />
					this is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that it should be seen<br />
					as it is<br />
					with the highest wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, beggars,<br />
					the educated student of the Aristocrats<br />
					has seen just enough of form;<br />
					has seen just enough of sense-experience;<br />
					has seen just enough of sense-perception;<br />
					has seen just enough of own-making;<br />
					has seen just enough of sense-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen enough is to be dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being dispassionate is to be released.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom comes the knowledge of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Discarded is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the life of Brahma,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no further is there for me this it'n-n-at'n.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what The Lucky Man said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleased by the word of the Lucky Man<br />
					the Group of Five Beggars were inspired,<br />
					and further<br />
					at the brilliance of this exposition<br />
					the Group of Five beggars<br />
					were wholly released in heart<br />
					from the corrputing influences.</p>
