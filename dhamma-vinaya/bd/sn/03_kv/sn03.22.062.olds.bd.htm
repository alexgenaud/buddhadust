					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Nirutti-patha. Nirutti: ni</i> = down; <i>rutti:</i> to the root, or essence; generally has a meaning something like 'intuitive etymology'. It is not 'book etymology' which looks for logical derivations of words but is etymology based on 'hearing' the intent of the original coiner of a word which is often not logical in the scientific sense (and perhaps more often than is comfortable, more logical in the scientific sense). Here the meaning is the intuitive understanding of things as they are, that is, in this case, that whatever the ultimate reality, the conventional world and orientation in it requires a sense of Time. There is no real understanding of things that does not double back to incorporate the conventional view. 'First there was a mountain, then there was no mountain, then there was.' This is the same logic as is required to understand that it is not 'There is no self' but 'There is no thing there that is the self.' That to say 'There is no self' negates the consensus reality on no better grounds than that on which the consensus reality is based: <i>i.e.,</i> opinion. To see that the world has no fundamental thing there equivalent to 'Time' does not negate the existence of the construct in the consensus reality.</p>
