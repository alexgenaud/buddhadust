					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, The Lucky Man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambīya</a><br />
					Ghosita Grove.</p>					

					<p class="f4">There then, The Lucky Man,<br />
					having aforetime taken up<br />
					his bowl and robes<br />
					entered Kosambī on his beggar's rounds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having gone on his beggars rounds
					in Kosambī and<br />
					having earlier returned and<br />
					eaten his meal,<br />
					he put away his bed-seat and<br />
					without informing the order,<br />
					alone,<br />
					without his attendant,<br />
					took up his bowl and robes and<br />
					departed a-wandering.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then<br />
					not long after the departure of<br />
					The Lucky Man<br />
					a certain beggar<br />
					approached Old Man Ānanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having approached Old Man Ānanda,<br />
					he said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Looky here friend Ānanda!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lucky Man<br />
					has put away his bed-seat and<br />
					without informing the order,<br />
					alone,<br />
					without his attendant,<br />
					took up his bowl and robes and<br />
					departed a-wandering!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever time, friend,<br />
					The Lucky Man<br />
					puts away his bed-seat and<br />
					without informing the order,<br />
					alone,<br />
					without his attendant,<br />
					takes up his bowl and robes and<br />
					departs a-wandering<br />
					at such time<br />
					The Lucky Man<br />
					wishes to be alone.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At such a time<br />
					nobody is to follow him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man<br /> 
					wandering around by stages<br /> 
					approached Pārileyyaka and<br /> 
					there stopped.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There at Pārileyyaka<br />
					The Lucky Man dwelt happily<br />
					at the root of a Lucky Sal Willow.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a large number of beggars<br />approached Ānanda and<br />
					drew near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having drawn near,<br />
					they exchanged polite greetings,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having exchanged polite greetings<br /> 
					they took seats to one side,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having taken seats to one side then,<br />
					they said this to Old Man Ānanda:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It has been a long time, friend Ānanda<br />
					since we have heard <i>Dhamma</i>-talk<br />
					face-to-face with The Lucky Man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We wish, friend Ānanda,<br />
					to hear <i>Dhamma</i>-talk<br /> 
					face-to-face with The Lucky Man."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So then Old Man Ānanda<br />
					together with those beggars,<br />
					went to Pārileyyaka,<br />
					the lucky sal willow, and<br />
					drew near The Lucky Man and<br />
					exchanged polite greetings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having exchanged polite greetings<br />
					they took seats to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With them seated to one side then,<br />
					The Lucky Man<br /> 
					instructed<br />
					aroused<br />
					gladdened and<br />
					delighted them<br />
					with a talk on <i>Dhamma.</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, a little while later,<br />
					this train of thought<br />
					arose in the mind<br />
					of a certain beggar:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"How, I wonder,<br />
					can one,<br />
					without delay<br />
					come to know and see<br />
					the destruction of<br /> 
					the corrupting influences?"<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that, The Lucky Man,<br />
					reading with his own heart<br />
					the heart of that beggar,<br />
					said this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I have, beggars,<br />
					thoroughly explained this <i>Dhamma.</i><span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Four Settings-up of Mind.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Four Best Efforts.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Four Power-Paths.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Five Forces.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Five Powers.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Seven Dimensions of Awakening.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have thoroughly explained<br />
					The Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Highway.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus I have<br />
					thoroughly explained<br />
					this <i>Dhamma</i> beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">And though I have thus<br />
					thoroughly explained<br />
					this <i>Dhamma,</i> beggars,<br />
					there remains this reflection<br />
					in the heart of a certain beggar:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'How, I wonder,<br />
					can one,<br />
					without delay<br />
					come to know and see<br />
					the destruction of<br /> 
					the corrupting influences?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how can one,<br />
					without delay<br />
					come to know and see<br />
					the destruction of<br />
					the corrupting influences?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here, beggars,<br />
					the uneducated commoner<br />
					not seeing the aristocrats,<br />
					not wise to the <i>Dhamma</i> of the aristocrats,<br />
					not guided by the <i>Dhamma</i> of the aristocrats,<br />
					not seeing the real-man,<br />
					not wise to the <i>Dhamma</i> of the real-man,<br />
					not guided by the <i>Dhamma</i> of the real-man<br />
					sees form as his self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That seeing, beggars,<br /> 
					is an own-making.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So of this own-making —<br />
					What is it tied to?<br />
					What is its origin?<br />
					What is its birth?<br />
					What produced it?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Born of blind contact, beggars,<br />
					affected by sense-experience,<br />
					in the uneducated commoner<br />
					there arises thirst.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From this comes own-making.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus, beggars,<br />
