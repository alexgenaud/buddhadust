					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The meaning is that this presentation of the facts is stripped of extraneous detail (the pure state) and consequently broad (oceanic) in its application.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Atthi.</i> Translated here as 'does there exist' to contrast it with the other translations as 'is there' to emphasize that what is being spoken of is that which has come to be as a consequence of contact, own-making, the conjunction of consciousness with named-form. This assumes relevance when confronting the statements made elsewhere that indicate that there is consciousness which is the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna. That</i> consciousness does not 'exist', has not been own-made, and is not a result of the conjunction of named-form and consciousness.</p>
