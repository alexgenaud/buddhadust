					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi-town</a> revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anathapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one time there the Ancient Rādha drew near <i>Bhagava,</i><br />
					gave salutation,<br />
					and took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, so seated,<br />
					the Ancient Rādha said this to <i>Bhagava:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"'Māra! Māra!' is the expression.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent, <i>Bhante,</i> can there be said to be Māra?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where there is form, Rādha,<br />
					there is Māra,<br />
					or death<br />
					or such as dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Rādha, you should see form as Māra,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as such as dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are seeing the best way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is sense experience, Rādha,<br />
					there is Māra,<br />
					or death<br />
					or such as dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Rādha, you should see sense experience as Māra,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as such as dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are seeing the best way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is perception, Rādha, there is Māra,<br />
					or death<br />
					or such as dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Rādha, you should see perception as Māra,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as such as dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are seeing the best way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is own-making, Rādha, there is Māra,<br />
					or death<br />
					or such as dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Rādha, you should see own-making as Māra,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as such as dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are seeing the best way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is consciousness, Rādha, there is Māra,<br />
					or death<br />
					or such as dies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Rādha, you should see consciousness as Māra,<br />
					see it as death,<br />
					see it as such as dies,<br />
					see it as disease,<br />
					see it as a boil,<br />
					see it as an arrowhead,<br />
					see it as the forefront of woe,<br />
					see it as the forefront of much woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those thus seeing are seeing the best way."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'seeing in the best way,' <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of seeing in the best way, Rādha,<br />
					is indifference."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'indifference,' <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of indifference, Rādha,<br />
					is dispassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'dispassion,' <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of dispassion, Rādha,<br />
					is freedom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'freedom,' <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The point of freedom, Rādha,<br />
					is <i>Nibbāna.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But 'Nibbāna,' <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					what is the point of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is the question, Rādha!</p>

					<p class="f4">But a question unanswerable<br />
					within graspable limits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is for a ford to <i>Nibbāna,</i> Rādha,<br />
					that one lives the Godly life,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> is the ultimate end,<br />
					<i>Nibbāna</i> is the final conclusion."</p>
