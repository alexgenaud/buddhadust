I hear this as 'not settled' (what PED hears as 'homely'). Not yet dumped in a lump. Then the more sophisticated meanings attach: not finished, not fixed, still subject to change, inconstant, impermanent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This is the "concisely taught <i>Dhamma</i>" (usually translated "teaching in brief"); the rest is elaboration. Or, it is sometimes said that everything the Buddha taught was taught concisely for he could elaborate endlessly from any point.</p>
