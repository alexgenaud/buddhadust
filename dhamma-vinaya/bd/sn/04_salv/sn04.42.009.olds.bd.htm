<meta name="description" content="The Pali text of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §42: Gamani-samyutta, Sutta 9. Nataputta tries to disgrace the Buddha by suggesting he is doing the families disservice going on begging rounds during a time of famine. The Buddha responds by saying that charity, honesty and being perceptive is the basis for prosperity. He then points out the eight real reasons for the destruction of families." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man<br />
					was traveling in Kosala<br />
					walking together with<br />
					an honorable company of beggars, and<br />
					had at that time<br />
					come to <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nālandā.</a></p>
					
					<p class="f4">While there in Nālandā<br />
					The Lucky Man was residing<br />
					in Pāvarika's Mango Grove.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover at that time<br />
					Nālandā was having difficulties —<br />
					the rice plants were rotting,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					turning white as bones, and<br />
					people were subsisting on<br />
					soup made from grasses.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Also at that time<br />
					Nāta's Son, the Nigaṇṭha<br />
					was dwelling in Nāḷandā<br />
					together with<br />
					a large retinue of Nigaṇṭhas.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">There then Asibandhakas's Son, the headman,<br />
					a disciple of<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son<br />
					went to where the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son was located,<br />
					drew near and<br />
					having drawn near the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhakas's Son,<br />
					having taken a seat to one side,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, headman,<br />
					take issue<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> with the shaman Gotama's speech, and thus<br />
					this lovely sounding reputation<br />
					will spread abroad about you:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Asibandhakas's Son, the headman,<br />
					so great in potency,<br />
					so great in eminence,<br />
					stuck it to<br />
					the shaman Gotama.'"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"How questioning, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					would I take issue with<br />
					the shaman Gotama,<br />
					so great in potency,<br />
					so great in eminence?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Come you headman,<br />
					go to where the shaman Gotama<br />
					is located, and<br />
					draw near and<br />
					having drawn near the shaman Gotama,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					say this to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Is it not true, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					that The Lucky Man,<br />
					in not just one way,<br />
					praises sympathy for,<br />
					praises the preservation of,<br />
					praises pity for,<br />
					the clans?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, headman, the shaman Gotama,<br />
					thus questioned,<br />
					thus responds:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It is even so, headman,<br />
					the Tathāgata,<br />
					in not just one way,<br />
					praises sympathy for,<br />
					praises the preservation of,<br />
					praises pity for,<br />
					the clans'<br />
					then you should respond thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But how is it then, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					that The Lucky Man,<br />
					at a time when<br />
					Nālandā is having such difficulties —<br />
					the rice plants rotting,<br />
					turning white as bones, and<br />
					people subsisting on<br />
					soup made from grasses<br />
					travels in Kosala<br />
					walking together with<br />
					a great company of beggars?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Unkindly,<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ruinously,<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Without compassion<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This two-pronged question, headman,<br />
					thus put to the shaman Gotama,<br />
					he will be seen unable<br />
					either to spit it out<br />
					or swallow it down."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, replying,<br />
					"So be it, Bhante."<br />
					the headman Asibandhakas's Son,<br />
					rose up from his seat,<br />
					gave salutation to Nāta's Son, the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					departed keeping him to his right, and<br />
					made his way to where The Lucky Man was located.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side,<br />
					Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Is it not true, Bhante,<br />
					that The Lucky Man,<br />
					in not just one way,<br />
					praises sympathy for,<br />
					praises the preservation of,<br />
					praises pity for,<br />
					the clans?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is even so, headman,<br />
					the Tathāgata,<br />
					in not just one way,<br />
					praises sympathy for,<br />
					praises the preservation of,<br />
					praises pity for,<br />
					the clans."</p>				
					
					<p class="f4">"But how is it then, Bhante,<br />
					that The Lucky Man,<br />
					at a time when<br />
					Nālandā is having such difficulties —<br />
					the rice plants rotting,<br />
					turning white as bones, and<br />
					people subsisting on<br />
					soup made from grasses<br />
					traveles in Kosala<br />
					walking together with<br />
					a great company of beggars?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Unkindly,<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ruinously,<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Without compassion<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As to this, headman,<br />
					in ninety-one <i>kappas</i><span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					where I have former recollection,<br />
					I have no knowledge<br />
					of injury to the clans,<br />
					of even so little as an upset,<br /> 
					resulting from a cooked offering —<br />
					great wealth,<br />
					abundant silver coinage,<br />
					abundant means of livelihood,<br />
					abundant grains and treasure,<br />
					all arise from giving, and<br />
					thus arise from<br />
					perception of this truth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are, headman,<br />
					eight which result<br />
					in the ruination of clans:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Kings bring about the ruination of clans, or<br />
					robbers bring about the ruination of clans, or<br />
					fire brings about the ruination of clans, or<br />
					water brings about the ruination of clans, or<br />
					ruination is brought about by being without a river, or<br />
					badly planned commerce comes to nothing,<br />
					wealth is scattered,<br />
					thrown away,<br />
					burnt up, and<br />
					just the changeable nature of things<br />
					for an eighth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are, headman,<br />
					the eight which bring about<br />
					in the ruination of clans.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These eight driving forces, headman,<br />
					these eight reasons,<br />
					that are there to be seen —<br />
					if someone speaks of me thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Unkindly,<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ruinously,<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Without compassion<br />
					The Lucky Man acts<br />
					towards the clans!'</p>

					<p class="f4">That speech, headman,<br />
					not let go,<br />
					that mental state<br />
					not let go,<br />
					that view<br />
					not given up —<br />
					then sucha one is<br />
					cast into <i>Niraya.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">This said Asibandhaka's son, the headman,<br />
					said this to The Lucky Man:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, <i>Bhante!</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Wonderful <i>Bhante!</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as though, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					one were to set upright the upside-down,<br />
					or uncover the covered,<br />
					or to show the way to one who was lost,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that creatures there might see:<br />
					'There are Forms!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, The Lucky Man has<br />
					in many a figure<br />
					presented his <i>Dhamma.</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I take myself to the Venerable Lucky Man  for refuge,<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Dhamma</i> for refuge;<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Saṅgha</i> for refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the Venerable Gotama remember me<br />
					as a lay disciple<br />
					who from this day<br />
					and for as long as life lasts<br />
					has taken refuge."</p>
