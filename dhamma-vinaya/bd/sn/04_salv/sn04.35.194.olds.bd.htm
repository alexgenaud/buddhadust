					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Salākāya.</i> PED meaning 9: membrum virile.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Sampalimaṭṭha.</i> SANG = with, to; + PARI = around; + MAṬṬHA = wipe, polish, clean. 'Seared' here borrwoed from Woodward. The word implies a wiping motion, hence with red-hot iron instruments, searing. The more literal 'wiped out', or 'rubbed out' as in American slang doesn't work well here. Bhk. Bodhi's 'lacerated' does not account for the fire factor nor the idea of rubbing or wiping.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Cakkhundriyaɱ. cakkhu- ~ indriya.</i> 'Faculty' here works better than my preferred 'force' for 'indriya.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Nimitta.</i> Usually translated 'signs'. The word means mark, sign (as in 'reading sign'; track, signature. Here the idea is using what is seen to help construct one's existence, one's story line.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>ṭhānam etaɱ vijjati.</i> 'standing on this vision' (or 'knowing' or 'wisdom'). I do not understand where Woodward gets his "firmly bound by the satisfaction" where the 'firmly bound' comes not from the <i>'ṭhānam'</i> but from the <i>'gadhitaŋ'</i> and similarly I do not understand where Bhkkhu Bodhi gets his 'gratification' in his: "stand tied to gratification". I believe the intended meaning is that 'holding on to this way of understanding and constructing the world, that is, through aggrigation of perceptions of signs and details encountered by the senses. Built on that, those signs and details being unstable, pursuit of a world built on them leads inevitably downward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Niraya.</i> Hell.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Spelled: <i>Saºku.</i> in the PTS and BJT text, PED spells it <i>'sanku.'</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The concluding refrain changes here in a way Woodward believes is an error. Bhk. Bodhi ignores the change. I have tried to make sense of it understnding the underlying idea to be that one who is asleep at least does not generate such ideas as would lead him to the doom of one who breaks up the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Tiṭṭhatu.</i> Really, 'Stand aside, stand down, set down'. Woodward's "Let alone", Bhk. Bodhi's "Leave off". It is a self-command which we would have most commonly as I have put it.</p>
