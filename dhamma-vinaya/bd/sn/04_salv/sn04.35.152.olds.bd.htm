					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky man,<br />

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man addressed the beggars, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the beggars responding <i>"Bhante!"</i><br />
					The Lucky Man said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there then, beggars,<br />

					whereby using such curiculum<br />
					a beggar,<br />
					other than through faith,<br />
					other than through finding it pleasing,<br />

					other than through yielding to<br />

					could declare omnicience thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Left behind is rebirth,<br />

					<p class="f4">"For us bhante,<br />

					<p class="f4">It would be good, bhante,<br />

					<p class="f4">That which is said<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then give ear, beggars,<br />
					pay good attention!<br />
					I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, the beggars saying<br />
					"Even so, bhante!"<br />
