					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, the Lucky Man,<br />
					Vesali-land revisiting,<br />
					Great Woods,<br />
					Peak'd Roof Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then towards evening,<br />
					the Lucky Man,<br />
					emerging from his solitary residence,<br />
					approached the sick-ward and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near,<br />
					he took a prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, seated there,<br />
					he addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindful, beggars — a beggar reaching his end,<br />
					should be self-aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is ever our instruction to you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars,<br />
					is a beggar mindful?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars,<br />
					a beggar living in body,<br />
					oversees the body,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-aware,<br />
					recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">living in sense-experience,<br />
					oversees the sensations,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-aware,<br />
					recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">living in the heart,<br />
					oversees the heart,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-aware,<br />
					recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">living in the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					oversees the <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-aware,<br />
					recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such then, beggars,<br />
					is a beggar's mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars,<br />
					is a beggar self-aware?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, a beggar<br />
					coming or going,<br />
					makes himself aware;<br />
					looking ahead or looking back,<br />
					makes himself aware;<br />
					putting forth or retracting,<br />
					makes himself aware;<br />
					bearing cloak, bowl and robes,<br />
					makes himself aware;<br />
					eating, drinking, chewing, or tasting,<br />
					makes himself aware;<br />
					passing matter or passing water,<br />
					makes himself aware;<br />
					on the go,<br />
					standing,<br />
					sitting,<br />
					asleep or<br />
					awake,<br />
					speaking or becoming silent,<br />
					makes himself aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, beggars,<br />
					is a beggar self-aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindful, beggars —<br />
					a beggar reaching his end,<br />

					<p class="f4">So he considers:</p>
