					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, the Lucky Man, Vesali-land revisiting,<br />
					Great Woods, Peak'd Roof Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then towards evening, the Lucky Man,<br />
					emerging from his solitary residence,<br />
					approached the sick-ward and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near, he took a prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, seated there, he addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindful, beggars — a beggar reaching his end,<br />
					should be self-aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is ever our instruction to you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, is a beggar mindful?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here beggars, a beggar living in body, oversees the body,<br />
					ardent, self-aware, recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">living in sense-experience, oversees the sensations,<br />
					ardent, self-aware, recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">living in the heart, oversees the heart,<br />
					ardent, self-aware, recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">living in the Dhamma, oversees the Dhamma,,<br />
					ardent, self-aware, recollected,<br />
					removing the miseries of worldly coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such then, beggars, is a beggars mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, beggars, is a beggar self-aware?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, a beggar<br />
					coming or going, makes himself aware;<br />
					looking ahead or looking back, makes himself aware;<br />
					putting forth or retracting, makes himself aware;<br />
					bearing cloak, bowl and robes, makes himself aware;<br />
					eating, drinking, chewing, or tasting, makes himself aware;<br />
					passing matter or passing water, makes himself aware;<br />
					on the go, standing, sitting, asleep or awake,<br />
					speaking or becoming silent, makes himself aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, beggars, is a beggar self-aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindful, beggars — a beggar reaching his end,<br />
					should be self-aware.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is ever our instruction to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">'There has come upon me experience of the pleasnt.</p>

					<p class="f4">But such is dependent,<br />
					not without dependency.</p>

					<p class="f4">On what dependent?</p>

					<p class="f4">On this very body dependent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And furthermore,<br />

					on the changeable, own-made body,<br />
					it follows that this experience of the pleasant<br />

					<p class="f4">How could it become unchangeable?'</p>
