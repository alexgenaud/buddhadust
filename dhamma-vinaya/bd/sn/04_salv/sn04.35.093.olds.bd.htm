					<p class="f4">There to the Beggars gathered round,<br />
					<i>Bhagava</i> said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">And what duality, beggars,<br />

					<p class="f4">The eye and shapes<br />

					<p class="f4">Unstable,<br />

					become 'otherwise'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that driving force,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, beggars,<br />
					following on,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now then, beggars,<br />
					whatever is the self-getting,<br />
					coinciding,<br />
					combining<br />
					of these three things,<br />
					this is called, beggars,<br />
