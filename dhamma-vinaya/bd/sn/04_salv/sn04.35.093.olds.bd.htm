					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Bhagava, Sāvatthi-town revisiting, Anāthapiṇḍika's Jeta grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There to the Beggars gathered round, Bhagava said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">A duality, beggars, results in itself becoming consciouss.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what duality, beggars, results in itself becoming conscious?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye and shapes result in the appearance of eye-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unstable,<br />
					changing,<br />
					the eye becomes "other".</p>

					<p class="f4">Unstable,<br />
					changing,<br />
					shapes become "other".</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this duality<br />
					thus gelatinous and wavering,<br />
					unstable,<br />
					changing,<br />
					become "other"<br />
					eye-consciousness<br />
					is unstable,<br />
					changing,<br />
					become "other".</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that driving force,<br />
					just as that result,<br />
					set up eye-consciousness,<br />
					so just that driving force,<br />
					so just that result<br />
					is unstable,<br />
					changing,<br />
					becoming "other".</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, beggers,<br />
					following on,<br />
					based on the unstable,<br />
					a result of self-rising,<br />
					how could eye-consciousness become constant?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then, beggars, whatever is the<br />
					self-getting,<br />
					coinsiding,<br />
					combining<br />
					of these three things,<br />
					this is called, beggars, 'eye-touch'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye-touch also is<br />
					unstable,<br />
					changing,<br />
					becoming "other".</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that driving force,<br />

					touch is feeling,<br />
