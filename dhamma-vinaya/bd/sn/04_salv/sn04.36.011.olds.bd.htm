					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This is not easy to construct in English. He sees a disparity in the two statements and seeks a reconciliation. In English we would say: "You said A. Then you said B. How do you reconcile the two? We would either not repeat the second statement after asking the question or we would repeat both statements. But this is a construction that is occasionally found in the <i>Pāḷi</i> ... and it sets going a sort of beat that reverberates through the rest of the sutta. It looks to be an artifact from the spoken presentation.</p>

Identification with the intent to create sense-experience for the self by way of acts of thought, word and deed and the resulting identified-with experience. The making of the personal world. Think of the simple statement: "I am going home now." Every word implies ownership or identity. That is 'own'-making. Making things one's own. This is the point where identification with the world begins. Coming out of one experience you inject your "self"-identity into another.</p>
