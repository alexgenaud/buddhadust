					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This reads 'a person arrow, pierced', not 'a person pierced by an arrow', so really it means 'arrowed', or, if it were a spear, 'speared'. It was probably heard as we hear 'shot'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Anuseti. ANU = follow after; SETI = set; incline towards. PED: [anu + seti. cp. Sanskrit anushayate or* shete, from shi] to "lie down with", i. e. (1) trs. to dwell on, harp on (an idea) 2. (of the idea) to obsess, to fill the mind persistently, to lie dormant and be continually cropping up. Woodward: 'fastens on'; Bhk. Bodhi: lies behind this; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'obsesses.' Nayanaponika Thera: 'comes to underlie (his mind)'.</p>					

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> [rebellion-, lust-, blindness]<i>-Anusaya.</i> ANU + SAYATI = 1. = SETI, to lie down; 2. to lean on; to be supported etc.:  PED: Bent, bias, proclivity, the persistance of a dormant or latent disposition, predisposition, tendency. Woodward: 'Lurking Tendency to repugnance, etc.'; Bhk. Bodhi: 'underlying tendency to aversion'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'resistance, etc. -obsession' Nayanaponika Thera: 'an underlying tendency of resistance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>yo dukkhāya [etc] vedanāya paṭighānusayo so anuseti</i><br />
					Woodward: 'Feeling that repugnance for the painful feeling, the lurking tendency to repugnance fastens on him.'<br />
					Bhk. Bodhi: 'When he harbours aversion towards painful feeling, the underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind this.'<br />
					Bhk. Thanissaro: 'Any resistance-obsession with regard to that painful feeling obsesses him.' 
					Nayanaponika Thera, 'in him who so resists (and resents) that painful feeling, an underlying tendency of resistance against that painful feeling comes to underlie (his mind).<br />
					I am saying that <i>'dukkhāya [etc] vedanāya paṭighānusayo</i> is a Germanic-like compound. 'Yo' = (who, what which; he whoever). So the meaning of the whole is that he who resents painful sensation is indulging in an inclination towards resentment, in indulging in an inclination towards resentment he seeks escape in sensual pleasure; he who seeks escape in sensual pleasure is indulging in an inclination towards lust; indulging in an inclination towards lust he is blind to the real way of escape in understanding the arising, settling down and escape that is understood when not-indulging; he who does not understand the escape is indulging in an inclination towards blindness the culmination of the series is being yoked to aging and death, etc.</p>
							
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> That's what it says: <i>Na vedanaɱ vediyati</i>. This would appear to contradict the opening statement. This could be an actual contradiction if the verses are taken to be commentary. But here the missing 'ti' at the end would seem to indicate that this was actually spoken by Gotama. How do we resolve it if it is not a contradiction? I see it as being a matter of the first case not necessarily being the arahant that is being spoken of, where in the verse we have the condition of the arahant. The well educated student of the Aristocrats still experiences experience, meaning feels sensations, or has 'experience through the senses' or in other terms still 'exists' where the arahant, no longer existing, has no experience through the senses. Neither Woodward nor Bhk. Bodhi nor Bhk. Thanissaro see it this way, but are forced to go beyond what is in the Pali to make their renderings make sense.</p>
			
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Not going beyond the initial impact to mental concern with it.</p>
