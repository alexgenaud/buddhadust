					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Old Man <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna The Great,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a> revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Moggallāna The Great addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars, my friends!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend!" the beggars responded to Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Old Man Moggallāna The Great said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friends,<br />
					as I had retreated into solitude<br />
					there arose in my heart<br />
					this train of thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The First Kenning!<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					The First Kenning!"<br />
					so they say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what then is the First Kenning?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So then it recurred to me, friends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here a beggar,<br />
					just isolating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
					just isolating himself from unskillful things,<br />
					with-rethinking,<br />
					with re-examination,<br />
					in the pleasant enjoyment<br />
					born of solitude<br />
					abides getting a grip<br />
					on The First Kenning.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what they call The First Kenning.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, friends,<br />
					just isolating himself from sense pleasures,<br />
					just isolating himself from unskillful things,<br />
					with-rethinking,<br />
					with re-examination,<br />
					in the pleasant enjoyment<br />
					born of solitude<br />
					abided getting a grip<br />
					on The First Kenning.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then, friends,<br />
					as I abided in this abiding,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there arose and came about me<br />
					attention of mind<br />
					to perceptions connected to sense-pleasures.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There then, friends,<br />
					The Lucky man, through his majesty,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					approached me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not, Brahmin,<br />
					be careless with The First Kenning!</p>

					<p class="f4">Set your heart on The First Kenning!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make one with your heart The First Kenning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Steady<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> your heart in The First Kenning!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So then I, friends<br />
					after a time,<br />
					just isolating myself from sense pleasures,<br />
					just isolating myself from unskillful things,<br />
					with-rethinking,<br />
					with re-examination,<br />
					in the pleasant enjoyment<br />
					born of solitude<br />
					abided getting a grip<br />
					on The First Kenning.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who would,<br />
					speaking highly of one,<br />
					friends,<br />
					say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master brought the student to attainment<br />
					of great higher knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">would,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Jhāna</i> Woodward's 'trance' here, elsewhere 'musing', 'gnosis', 'absorption'. I have used 'knowing'. The <i>jhānas,</i> at a certain point definitely resemble or might as well be called trances, but the implication of the word distorts the reality. What these states are is wide-awake, fully conscious awareness of states of reality. The word <i>'jhāna'</i> is the root of our word 'Know' and it would be best to emphasize that aspect of <i>jhāna</i> over the fact that from the outside the individual highly concentrated in <i>jhāna</i> seems to be in a trance state. Hence my regurgitation of the obscure word: 'ken'. This, over 'knowing' for two reasons: 1. the similarity in sound to <i>'zen'</i> and <i>'chan'</i> and <i>'jhāna';</i> and 2. to rise above the ordinary implications of 'knowing' which would otherwise work well.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><b>Ken:</b> OED: "The form is properly causative 'to cause to know', to make known', and was restricted to this use in Goth. and OE. At an early period, however, in all the Teutonic tongues, the verb also acquired the sense 'to know', in English this may have been taken from Norse, in which both senses were in early use." (Likely from the original idea of 'seeing' as 'understanding'. -mo)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Meanings: 7. "To recognize (at sight or by some marks or tokens); to identify.<br />
					8. To recognize, acknowledge, admit to be (genuine, valid, or what is claimed)<br />
					9. To get to know, ascertain, find out.<br />
					11. To know (a thing): to have knowledge of or about (a thing, place, person., etc.). To be acquainted with, to understand.<br />
					11.b. To know, understand, or perceive (a fact., etc.); to be aware of, to be aware that (what, etc.)."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Woodward, citing the commentary, inserts in brackets here "(and had emerged from trance)." I object. This is to impose on the <i>jhānas</i> a term and construction not found in their descriptions and by that to build the foundation of the bias that the <i>jhānas</i> are a mysterious state no longer attainable. The <i>jhānas</i> are as they are described. The First Kenning is adjacent to the normal state of the mind. It is subject to being harassed by lower things and that is what is happening to Moggallāna at this point. He is bouncing back and forth and it is to steady his mind in the position above worldly things that the Lucky Man appears to him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi adds "accompanied by thought and examination", which is not in PTS, BJT or CSCD <i>Pāḷi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Iddhi.</i> Magic power.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Samādahā.</i> This could be <i>saṃ + ādahati,</i> con-flagrate, kindle, per PED, or <i>samā dahati,</i> even-burn per me. What it means is to bring the fire from the point of being lit to the point where it is a steady flame.</p>
