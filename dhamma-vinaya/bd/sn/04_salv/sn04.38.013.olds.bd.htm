					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Old Man Sāriputta,<br />
					was living amungst the Magadhese,<br />
					in Nālagā town.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Roseapple-Eater, the wanderer,<br />
					went to where Old Man Sāriputta was located,<br />
					where he drew near and<br />
					having drawn near Old Man Sāriputta,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />
					Roseapple-Eater, the wanderer, said this<br />
					to Old Man Sāriputta:</p>					

					<p class="f4">"'Becommng, becomming,'<br />
					they say, friend Sāriputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What then, friend,<br />
					is becomming?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are these three becommings:<br />
					sense-pleasure becomming,<br />
					form becomming,<br />
					formless becomming.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">These, friend,<br />
					are what is called becommings."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there, friend, a Way,<br />
					is there a path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					these bindups?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is, friend, a Way,<br />
					there is a path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					these bindups.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What, friend, is that Way,<br />
					what is that path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					these bindups?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate view,<br />
					consummate principles,<br />
					consummate talk,<br />
					consummate works,<br />
					consummate lifestyle,<br />
					consummate self-control,<br />
					consummate mind,<br />
					consummate serenity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This is, friend, that Way,<br />
					that path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					these bindups.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"A lucky Way, friend,<br />
					a lucky path,<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					these bindups and<br />
					moreover, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					there is enough there<br />
					to bring about non-carelessness."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> "Sphere" (Bhikkhu Bodhi) is not in the <i>Pāḷi.</i> What the Pāḷi says is "kāma-bhavo, rūpa-bhavo, arūpa-bhavo;" "Sense pleasure-becoming, form-becoming, formless becoming". The idea is not that one is born amongst them or with these attributes. The meaning is that this is a description of 'things' that are bound to sense pleasures, forms or the formless by way of thirst. The use of 'existence," or "living", or "being" is a way to reach the understanding of people today [Friday, December 20, 2024 6:15 AM] that there is no distinction being made beween existence and becoming when consciousness arises in connection with named forms. But there is a distinction: <i>"bhava"</i> describes an on-going process, not a static state of being within a sphere. So there is the experience of a knowing of things becoming, but no longer a seeing them as existing, or living beings, or being alive, except, of course, as a matter of conventional speech.</p>
