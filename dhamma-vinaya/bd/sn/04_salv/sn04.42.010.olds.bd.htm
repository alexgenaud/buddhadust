					<p class="f4">Once Upon a Time, The Lucky Man, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rajagaha,</a><br />
					Bamboo Grove,<br />
					the squirrels' feeding place<br />
					came-a revisiting.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at this time,<br />
					in the king's palace<br />
					the king's inner circle<br />
					was sitting down together and<br />
					among those who had come together<br />
					this line of talk arose:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Gold and silver<br />
					are proper<br />
					for the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are permitted<br />
					the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are accepted<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at this time<br />
					Manicūḷaka, the headman,<br />
					was seated among them and<br />
					there then Manicūḷaka, the headman,<br />
					said this to that group:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Do not speak thus!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not proper<br />
					for the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not permitted<br />
					the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not accepted<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Laid aside are jems and gold<br />
					
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Done with are<br />
					things of gold and silver."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But it was not possible<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at that time, for<br />
					Manicūḷaka, the headman,<br />
					to impart that knowledge<br />
					to that group.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, Manicūḷaka, the headman,<br />
					went to where The Lucky Man was located,<br />
					where he drew near and<br />
					having drawn near The Lucky Man,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />
					Manicūḷaka, the headman, said this<br />
					to The Lucky Man:</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">"Just now, <i>bhante,</i><br />
					in the king's palace<br />
					the king's inner circle<br />
					was sitting down together and<br />
					among those who had come together<br />
					this line of talk arose:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Gold and silver<br />
					are proper<br />
					for the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are permitted<br />
					the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are accepted<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at this time, <i>bhante,</i><br />
					I was seated among them and<br />
					there then I said this<br />
					to that group:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Do not speak thus!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not proper<br />
					for the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not permitted<br />
					the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not accepted<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Laid aside are jems and gold<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Done with are<br />
					things of gold and silver.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But it was not possible, <i>bhante,</i><br />
					at that time, for me<br />
					to impart that knowledge<br />
					to that group.</p>					

					<p class="f4">Here, <i>bhante,</i><br />
					did I, thus relating and speaking,<br />
					accurately convey,<br />
					in such a way as to be blameless,<br />
					the Lucky Man's<br />
					Dhamma within the Dhamma and<br />
					not falsely misrepresent<br />
					him by portraying his Dhamma<br />
					with what is not-Dhamma?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, headman, you,<br />					
					thus relating and speaking,<br />
					accurately conveyed,<br />
					in such a way as to be blameless,<br />
					the Dhamma within the Dhamma and<br />
					did not falsely misrepresent<br />
					me by portraying the Dhamma<br />
					with what is not-Dhamma?</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not proper<br />
					for the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not permitted<br />
					the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gold and silver<br />
					are not accepted<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Laid aside are jems and gold<br />
					by the shamen of the Sakyan-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Done with are<br />
					things of gold and silver.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those, headman,<br />
					for whom gold and silver are proper,<br />
					are likewise those<br />
					for whom sense-pleasures are proper.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As for those<br />
					for whom sense pleasures<br />
					are proper, headman,<br />
					you can know for certain:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Their's is not<br />
					a shaman's Dhamma,<br />
					their's is not<br />
					a son of the Sakiyan's Dhamma.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On the other hand, headman,<br />
					I say this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thatch may be saught for<br />
					by those set on thatch;<br />
					wood may be saught for<br />
					by those set on wood;<br />
					a cart may be saught for<br />
					by those set on a cart<br />
					a person may be saught for<br />
					by those set on a person.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But not in any way, headman,<br />
					do I say that gold and silver<br />
					are to be accepted<br />
					are to be saught after."</p>
