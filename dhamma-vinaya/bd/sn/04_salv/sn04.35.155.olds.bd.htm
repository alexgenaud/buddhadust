The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that at the point where the instability of personal sense experience is seen as unstable the destruction of the motivation to take enjoyment in the senses has been reached and with the destruction of the motivation to take enjoyment in the senses the lust for sense pleasure has been destroyed. With the destruction of taking enjoyment in lust the heart is freed." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>nibbindati</i> nis + vindati; NIS = put down, end, extinguish; VINDATI = to know. Here the point where the search for things to take enjoyment in has achieved satisfaction. The point where one can no longer be fooled by the hope of finding lasting enjoyment in any sense experience. The word used here must bridge the gap between seeing  consummately and having achieved the destruction of taking enjoyment in sense experiences.</p>
