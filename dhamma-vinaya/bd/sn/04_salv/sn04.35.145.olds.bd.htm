					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Lucky Man,<br />
					to the Beggars gathered round<br />
					said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Bhikkhus!"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And upon the <i>bhikkhus</i> responding <i>"Bhante!"</i> <i>Bhagava</i> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will describe to you, beggars,<br />
					deeds new-and-old,<br />
					deed-ending,<br />
					and the walk to walk to deed-ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">So listen up,<br />
					study this well in mind!</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak!</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars are old deeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye, beggars, is an old deed,<br />
					which should be seen as the over-with own-made,<br />
					over-with own-intent to experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ear, beggars, is an old deed,<br />
					which should be seen as the over-with own-made,<br />
					over-with own-intent to experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nose, beggars, is an old deed,<br />
					which should be seen as the over-with own-made,<br />
					over-with own-intent to experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tongue, beggars, is an old deed,<br />
					which should be seen as the over-with own-made,<br />
					over-with own-intent to experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Body, beggars, is an old deed,<br />
					which should be seen as the over-with own-made,<br />
					over-with own-intent to experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind, beggars, is an old deed,<br />
					which should be seen as the over-with own-made,<br />
					over-with own-intent to experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what is called 'old deeds'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what beggars, are new deeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever there is now of present deeds,<br />
					constructed bodily,<br />
					through speech or in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what is called 'new deeds'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is deed-ending?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, beggars,<br />
					it is whatever bodily-deed<br />
					deed of speech<br />
					deed of mind touches freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what is called<br />
					'deed-ending'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, beggars, is the walk to walk to deed-ending?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this Aristocratic Eight-dimensional High Way,<br />
					that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">High view<br />
					high principles,<br />
					high talk,<br />
					high works,<br />
					high lifestyle,<br />
					high self-control,<br />
					high mind,<br />
					high serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, beggars, is what is called<br />
					'the walk to walk to deed-ending.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">This then is the description<br />
					of deeds new-and-old,<br />
					the description of deed-ending,<br />
					and the description of the walk to walk to deed-ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever, beggars, a teacher should do<br />
					out of empathy with his students,<br />
					in friendliness,<br />
					out of compassion,<br />
					motivated by compassion,<br />
					that I have done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, beggars, are the roots of trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are empty places.</p>

					<p class="f4">Get fired up beggars!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not be careless!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not find yourself regretting later.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my advice to you."</p>
