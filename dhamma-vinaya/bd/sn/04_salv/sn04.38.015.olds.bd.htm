					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Old Man Sāriputta,<br />
					was living amongst the Magadhese,<br />
					in Nālagā town.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Roseapple-Eater, the wanderer,<br />
					went to where Old Man Sāriputta was located,<br />
					where he drew near and<br />
					having drawn near Old Man Sāriputta,<br />
					having given salutation,<br />
					took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken a seat to one side then,<br />
					Roseapple-Eater, the wanderer, said this<br />
					to Old Man Sāriputta:</p>					

					<p class="f4">"'Own body view<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, own body view,'<br />
					they say, friend Sāriputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What then, friend,<br />
					is own body view?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are these five stockpiles grasped after as own-body<br />
					spoken of by the Lucky Man:<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					grasping after the stockpile comprised of form,<br />
					grasping after the stockpile comprised of sense-experience,<br />
					grasping after the stockpile comprised of perception,<br />
					grasping after the stockpile comprised of own-making,<br />
					grasping after the stockpile comprised of consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These, friend,<br />
					are the five stockpiles<br />
					grasped after as own-body<br />
					spoken of by the Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there, friend, a Way,<br />
					is there a path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					this own body?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is, friend, a Way,<br />
					there is a path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					this own body.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What, friend, is that Way,<br />
					what is that path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					this own body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Aristocratic Multi-dimensional Way,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">Consummate view,<br />
					consummate principles,<br />
					consummate talk,<br />
					consummate works,<br />
					consummate lifestyle,<br />
					consummate self-control,<br />
					consummate mind,<br />
					consummate serenity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This is, friend, that Way,<br />
					that path<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					this own body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"A lucky Way, friend,<br />
					a lucky path,<br />
					to thoroughly understand<br />
					this own body and<br />
					moreover, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					there is enough there<br />
					to bring about non-carelessness."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsakkaaya"><i>Sakkāya</i></a><span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn*" href="#n*">*</a>]</sup></span> Though <i>"diṭṭhi"</i> is not in the <i>Pāḷi</i> here it is assumed that view was the intent of the question, not just that it was an inquiry as to how the Buddha would describe what was thought of as body, or whether or not one or another of the <i>khandhas</i> is the self, or the issue of whether or not the self exists. It is the error of the view that however seen (whether of one or several or all of the <i>khandhas</i>; existing or not existing, self or not self) that is the one true way of seeing the body and all other ways of describing it are incorrect that is the thing to be understood.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Note that in this sutta he speaks of what is said by the Lucky Man — not just himself as with the previous suttas in this group. This is the crucial point in the series; the first thing Rose-apple-eater needs to understand to see the distinction between Gotama's system and the systems of other teachers — to become converted, to become a Streamwinner. It is for this reason, I believe, that it is of vital importance, that it not be disregarded, that Sāriputta puts this as he does.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n*" href="#fn*">*</a>]</sup> For this word in this sutta at this time [Tuesday, December 24, 2024 8:33 AM] clicking this link should bring the reader to the version of the PED (as modified on and for this site) and this word, where the <i>Nikāya</i> citations are live links. Also, please note that this is a very large file and it takes a time to locate the word — both directions! to and from a citation. Also please note that the citations, naturally enough, are mostly to the <i>Pāḷi,</i> to also see the various translations use the links at the beginning of suttas or the link to the index over the title of the sutta.</p>
