From there we see that the trick of this sutta is that the previous five consciousnesses become the sense-objects (phenomena) that together with 'brain' are the cause of 'mental consciousness' or the consciousness with which we are ordinarily associating the self. So the hearer has to this point clearly seen how the other senses depend on a sense organ and sense object and so is forced to accept the notion that the mind operates in exactly the same way and is just as impersonal.</p>
