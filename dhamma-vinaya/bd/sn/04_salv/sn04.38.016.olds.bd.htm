<meta name="description" content="The M. Olds translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 38, Sutta 16. In responses to questions from the Wanderer Rose-apple-eater the Venerable Sariputta explains that going forth from the household life into the homeless state is hard to do, that for one who has gone forth feeling delight is hard, that for one who has gone forth and feels delight, living in conformity with the Dhamma is hard to do, but for one who has managed all these things, Arahantship is not hard to get." />
