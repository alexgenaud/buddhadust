					Well, OK, but I would rather say that neither the eye nor visible objects belong to the self in the sense of being under the control of a self; if it were the case that the eye were the yoke [and remember, this is 'the yoke to rebirth', not just a yoke to each other], of form or if form were the yoke of eye, there could be no liberation because there is nothing in that that can be controlled by the individual. In the case where it is the wanting and lust that is the yoke, this is something under the control of the individual and can be dealt with and by that curriculum one is able to reach consummate freedom of mind.</p>
