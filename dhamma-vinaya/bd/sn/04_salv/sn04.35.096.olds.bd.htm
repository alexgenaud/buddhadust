					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man, Rājagaha revisiting, the Squirrel's Veluva Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the beggars gathered round:<br />
					Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Bhaghava!" the beggars responded.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man said:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">[2] "I will delineate for you, beggars, losing your grip, not losing your grip, and mastry over the six realms:</p>

					<p class="f4">[3] And what, beggars, is losing your grip?</p>

					<p class="f4">[4] In the case of this case, we have the case of the beggar who at the sight of an object by the eye is assailed by bad, unprincipled, unskillful recollections and ideas downbound to rebirth. </p>

					<p class="f4">If such a beggar allows in, does not let go of, does not dispel, does not end, does not cause them to stop becoming, this is how he should understand the case:<br />
					"I am losing my grip of skillful things!<br />
					This is called 'losing your grip' by the Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">[5] And again, we have the case of the beggar who at the hearing of a sound by the ear is assailed by bad, unprincipled, unskillful recollections and ideas downbound to rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">[7] And again, we have the case of the beggar who at the savour of a taste by the tongue is assailed by bad, unprincipled, unskillful recolections and ideas downbound to rebirth.</p>
