					<p class="f4">"Five, beggars, are powers of women.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The power of beauty,<br />
					the power of wealth,<br />
					the power of relatives,<br />
					the power of sons,<br />
					the power of ethical conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus she is incomplete because of this dimension,</p>

					<p class="f4">But suppose her possessed<br />
					of the power of wealth,<br />
					the power of relatives,<br />
					the power of sons,<br />
					the power of ethical conduct,<br />
					and of the power of beauty<br />
					then she is complete through that dimension.</p>
