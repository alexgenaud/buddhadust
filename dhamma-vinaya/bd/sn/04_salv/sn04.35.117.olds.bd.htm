					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>This is not a full translation. This is a patchwork of adaptations from the translations of Woodward and <i>Bhk.</i> Bodhi plus my own translation of certain terms and phrases all rolled into an intuitive understanding of the sutta. This is being done because I strongly feel the original <i>Pāḷi</i> was edited incorrectly in a way which has spoiled the meaning. You can think of this as just a convenient way for me to explain the meaning of the sutta as I understand it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man,<br />

					at the Brick Hall.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Bhikkhus!"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And <i>"Bhaghava!"</i> the beggars responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before I was awakened, beggars,<br />
					with the higher awakening,<br />
					when I was still a <i>bodhisatva,</i><br />
					this thought occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
					that previously have overlaid the heart<br />
					have passed,<br />

					but still my mind could be disturbed<br />

					or by those that are anticipated,<br />
					or by those which are present.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, as to those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
					I should, for my own good,<br />
					be careful<br />
					and remember to guard my heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that, beggars,<br />
					those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
					that previously overlaid your hearts —<br />
					they have passed,<br />
					are over with<br />
					or are changed,<br />
					but still your minds could be disturbed<br />

					<p class="f4">That is what is to be experienced of the world, beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, beggars,<br />
					as to those five cords of worldy sense pleasures<br />
					you should, for your own good,<br />

					<p class="f4">So saying the Lucky Man rose from his seat and entered the residence.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the Lucky Man had gone,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to those beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is this venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda said: -</p>

					and,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is just what has happened to you venerable ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though you had the Master face-to-face<br />

					<i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Surely that was the time<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, friend," replied those beggars to the venerable Ānanda, who said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you wish, friends,<br />

							<p class="in2">That is, that it was spoken, friends,<br />
							by the <i>Bhagava</i> concerning<br />
							the sixfold realm of the senses,<br />
							and could be said this way:</p>

							<p class="in2">"Those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
							that previously have left their impression on your hearts —<br />
							they have passed,<br />
							are over with<br />
							or are changed,<br />
							but still your minds could be disturbed<br />
							by those that are passing away,<br />
							or by those that are anticipated,<br />
							or by those which are present.</p>

							<p class="in2">That is what is to be experienced of the world, beggars.</p>

							<p class="in2">Wherein eye and perception of objects fade away, -<br />
							that is what is to be experienced of the world<br />
							wherein ear and perception of sounds fade away, -<br />
							that is what is to be experienced of the world<br />
							wherein nose and perception of scents fade away, -<br />
							that is what is to be experienced of the world<br />
							wherein tongue and perception of savours fade away, -<br />
							that is what is to be experienced of the world<br />
							wherein body and perception of touch fade away -<br />
							that is what is to be experienced of the world.</p>

							<p class="in2">Wherefore, friends,<br />
							as to those five cords of worldy sense pleasures<br />
							you should, for your own good,<br />
							be careful<br />
							and remember to guard your hearts."</p>

							<p class="in2">This, friends is what I understand to be the meaning<br />
							of that teaching spoken in brief by the <i>Bhagava</i><br />
							but not elaborated in detail.</p>

							<p class="in2">But if you wish, friends,<br />
							the venerable ones should approach the <i>Bhagava</i><br />
							and question him about the matter, and,<br />
							according as the <i>Bhagava</i> explains it,<br />
							so should you remember it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, friend,' we replied to the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and then rising up we came to the Bhagava."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lucky Man replied: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage, beggars, is Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of great wisdom, beggars, is Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you were to put this question to me,<br />
					I should explain it even as Ānanda explained it to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning of that teaching,<br />
					and so should you bear it in mind."</p>
