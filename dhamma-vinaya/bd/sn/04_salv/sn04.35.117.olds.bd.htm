					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>This is not a translation. This is a patchwork of adaptations from the translations of Woodward and Bhk. Bodhi plus my own translation of certain terms and phrases all rolled into an intuitive understanding of the sutta. This is being done because I strongly feel the original Pali was edited incorrectly in a way which has spoiled the meaning. You can think of this as just a convenient way for me to explain the meaning of the sutta as I understand it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man, possibly while staying in Nātika at the Brick Hall.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the beggars gathered round:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And "Bhaghava!" the beggars responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then The Lucky Man said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before I was awakened, beggars,<br />
					with the higher awakening,<br />
					when I was still a bodhisatva,<br />
					this thought occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
					that previously have overlaid the heart<br />
					have passed,<br />
					are over with,<br />
					or are changed,<br />
					but still my mind could be disturbed<br />
					by those that are passing away,<br />
					or by those that are anticipated,<br />
					or by those which are present.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, as to those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
					I should, for my own good,<br />
					be careful<br />
					and remember to guard my heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that, beggars,<br />
					those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />
					that previously overlaid your hearts —<br />
					they have passed,<br />
					are over with<br />
					or are changed,<br />
					but still your minds could be disturbed<br />
					by those that are passing away,<br />
					or by those that are anticipated,<br />
					or by those which are present.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what is to be experienced of the world, beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, beggars,<br />
					as to those five cords of worldy sense pleasures<br />
					you should, for your own good,<br />
					be careful<br />
					and remember to guard your hearts."</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying the Lucky Man rose from his seat and entered the residence.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the Lucky Man had gone,<br />
					it occurred to those beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Bhagava, rose from  his seat and entered his residence<br />
					having given us this teaching in brief,<br />
					without elaborating its meaning in detail:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Those five cords of worldly sense pleasures<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">That is what is to be experienced of the world, beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">Who now could elaborate to us in detail<br />
					the meaning of this teaching<br />
					given to us in brief by the Bhagava,<br />
					without elaborating its meaning in detail?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to those beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is this venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who is praised by the Master<br />
					and honoured by those living the brahma life who understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda is capable of elaborating in detail<br />

					<p class="f4">Let us go visit the venerable Ānanda,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So those beggars went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					came into his presence<br />
					and greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of mutual courtesies,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those beggars said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, imagine a man in need of sound timber,<br />
					in quest of sound timber,<br />
					going about searching for sound timber,<br />
					and he comes upon a tree,<br />
					sturdy,<br />
					with thoroughly sound timber:<br />
					and,<br />
					leaving the root,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is just what has happened to you venerable ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though you had the Master face-to-face<br />

					Lord of the Dhamma,<br />
					Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely that was the time<br />

					<p class="f4">What the Bhagava said to you,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is true, friend Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then listen carefully.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, friend," replied those beggars to the venerable Ānanda, who said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand the meaning in detail, friends, this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you wish, friends,<br />

							wherein tongue and perception of savours fade away, -<br />
							that is what is to be experienced of the world<br />

							<p class="in2">Wherefore, friends,<br />
							as to those five cords of worldy sense pleasures<br />
							you should, for your own good,<br />
							be careful<br />
							and remember to guard your hearts."</p>

							<p class="in2">This, friends is what I understand to be the meaning<br />
							of that teaching spoken in brief by the Bhagava<br />
							but not elaborated in detail.</p>

							<p class="in2">But if you wish, friends,<br />
							the venerable ones should approach the Bhagava<br />
							and question him about the matter, and,<br />
							according as the Bhagava explains it,<br />
							so should you remember it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, friend,' we replied to the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and then rising up we came to the Bhagava."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lucky Man replied: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage, beggars, is Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of great wisdom, beggars, is Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you were to put this question to me,<br />
					I should explain it even as Ānanda explained it to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning of that teaching,<br />
					and so should you bear it in mind."</p>
