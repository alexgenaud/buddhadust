					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Nimittā.</i> Signs, indications, marks, signatures. Of any thing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Aññato,</i> Another. Woodward has translated the word 'aññato' by 'changeable'. This is, with a certain amount of contortion, not incorrect, but misses the idea which is that the eye, etc. should be regarded as 'other'. That is other than the self or one's own. One can regard a thing as changeable but still regard it as one's own or one's self. Bhk. Bodhi has 'differently'; Bhk. Thanissaro: 'something separate'. Something different or separate can also be regarded as one's own.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammas.</i> All things. The mind here being spoken of is the mind of the individual which acts as a sense organ in this case receiving it's sense-stimula from the other sense-organs and memory (mind perceiving mental objects).</p>
