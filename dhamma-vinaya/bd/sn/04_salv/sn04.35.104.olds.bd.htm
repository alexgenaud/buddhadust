					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Yoga.</i> I usually translate this literally as 'yoke', but here that would possibly mislead. The term is often translated 'devotion.' The use by me of "avocation" is me playing around with words. The term 'avocation' in its meaning as 'occupation', is a corruption of the original 'a-vocation': to call away from an occupation. So here the intended meaning is 'an occupation that calls away from an occupation', that is, "letting go".</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i><i>Tathāgata.</i></i> In some cases a name given to the Buddha by himself and others; in other cases any individual who has 'Got it", meaning one who has attained the goal of utter freedom of heart amd the having eradicated sense pleasure, becoming, views, and blindness.</p>
