					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Old Man <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna The Great,</a><br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī-town</a> revisiting,<br />
					Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Old Man Moggallāna The Great addressed the beggars:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Beggars, my friends!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend! the beggars responded to Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Old Man Moggallāna The Great said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, friends, as I had retreated into solitude<br />
					there arose in my heart<br />
					this train of thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"The Fourth Knowing!<br />
					The Fourth Knowing!"<br />
					so they say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what then is the Fourth Knowing?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So then it recurred to me, friends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Here a beggar,<br />
					letting go of his pleasures<br />
					letting go of his pains<br />
					his anticedent mental ease and mental pain retiring<br />
					without pain<br />
					without pleasure<br />
					detached-recollected-thoroughly purified<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					abides getting a grip<br />
					on the fourth knowing."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what they call the fourth knowing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, friends,<br />
					letting go of my pleasures<br />
					letting go of my pains<br />
					my anticedent mental ease and mental pain retiring<br />
					without pain<br />
					without pleasure<br />
					detached-recollected-thoroughly purified<br />
					abided getting a grip<br />
					on the fourth knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then, friends,<br />
					as I abided in this abiding,<br />
					there arose and came about me<br />
					attention of mind to<br />
					perceptions connected to pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then, friends,<br />
					The Lucky man, through his magisty,<br />
					approached me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not, brahmin,<br />
					be careless with the fourth knowing!</p>

					<p class="f4">Set your heart on the fourth knowing!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make one with your heart the fourth knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Steady your heart in the fourth knowing!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So then I, friends,<br />
					letting go of my pleasures<br />
					letting go of my pains<br />
					my anticedent mental ease and mental pain retiring<br />
					without pain<br />
					without pleasure<br />
					detached-recollected-thoroughly purified<br />
					abided getting a grip<br />
					on the fourth knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who would, speaking highly of one, friends, say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Master brought the student to attainment of great higher knowledge,"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Upekkhā-sati-pārisuddhiɱ.</i> Woodward has for <i>Upekkhā-sati-pārisuddhiɱ.</i> <i>"a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity,"</i> which either ignores <i>'sati'</i> or (unlikely) translates it as 'balance.' I argue that <i>'upekkhā',</i> usually translated 'equanimity' should be translated 'detachment'. PED: "looking on", hedonic neutrality or indifference, zero point between joy and sorrow ... disinterestedness, neutral feeling, equanimity. Sometimes equivalent to <i>adukkham-asukha-vedanā</i> "feeling which is neither pain nor pleasure". (Which is the <i>'vedanā'</i> of the Arahant, or the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna.</i> — <i>'Upekkhā'</i> is also the equivalent of <i>'vimutti',</i> 'freedom,' which is also the equivalent of <i>Nibbāna.</i>) I except "equanimity". Equanimity is a state of impassivity which is a precurser to detachment (see the Sixth <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm">Sambojjhanga</a>) and is a state which is still involved with the world. The goal is a state that is at least temporarily not involved with the world.</p>
