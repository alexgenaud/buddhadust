					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, The Lucky Man,<br />
					Sāvatthi-town revisiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Tangle Bhāradvāja brāhman approached The Lucky Man and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near<br />
					he exchanged greetings with The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having exchanged greetings,<br />
					he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Tangle Bhāradvāja brāhman<br />
					addressed The Lucky Man in verses:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Tangled within, tangled-without<br />
							a generation entangled in tangles this!<br />
							Of you Gotama I ask:<br />
							who from this tangle's untangled?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"On ethics standing firm<br />
							courageous in wisdom,<br />
							wise of heart become,<br />
					      Ardent, industrious,<br />
							he this tangle the <i>bhikkhu's</i> untangled.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Those, of lust, anger and blindness cleansed,<br />
							Influence-rid Arahants,<br />
							these this tangle untangled.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Where name and form -<br />
							reaction to perception of form -<br />
							entirely extirpated are<br />
							there this tangle's cut through."</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Tangle Bhāradvāja brāhman said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful good Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful good Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as though, good Gotama,<br />
					one were to set upright the upside-down,<br />
					or uncover the covered,<br />
					or to show the way to one who was lost,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that creatures there might see:<br />
					'There are forms!'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, the good Gotama has<br />
					in many a figure<br />
					presented his <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I take myself to the venerable Gotama for refuge,<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Dhamma</i> for refuge;<br />
					I take myself to the <i>Saṅgha</i> for refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would receive the going forth<br />
					in the presence of The Lucky Man,<br />
					taking on full ordination."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Tangle Bhāradvāja brāhman received the going forth<br />
					in the presence of The Lucky Man,<br />
					and took on full ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after his ordination,<br />
					Tangle Bhāradvāja brāhman,<br />
					living apart,<br />
					free of carelessness, ardent, self-determined,<br />
					quickly achieved that aim,<br />
					that unsurpassed Best of Lives,<br />
					for which the sons of clansmen go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					experiencing it for himself<br />
					in this seen thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knew from personal experience that:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Left behind is rebirth<br />
					lived is the best of lives,<br />
					done is duty's doing,<br />
					no further it'n-'n-at'n' for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became another one of the Arahants.</p>
