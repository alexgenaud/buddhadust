					<p><b>Of Related Interest:</b></p>

					<p class="f4">A Note on <i>Sammā Samādhi</i></p>

					<p>There are "The Four Types (characteristics of) <i>samādhi,</i> [<a href="#p5.7">DN 34.5.7</a>] which includes a <i>samādhi</i> that 'partakes of decline' which I bring up just to push the point that the term <i>'samādhi'</i> is broad and flexible (officially, it encompasses the entire <i>Dhamma,</i> from giving <i>(dana)</i> to detachment <i>(upekkha).</i> And further it is understood to be a thing which is attained by non-Buddhists, in the same way as serenity is not the exclusive property of Buddhists. In other words, it can be worldly and lead to the worldly.</p>

					<p>Further on there is "The Five knowings of <i>sammā-samādhi.</i>" [<a href="#p5.8">DN 34.5.8</a>] Firstly this supports my translation of <i>jhāna</i> as 'knowing' (also 'kenning' and 'gnosis'), and looking at the details we find:</p>

					<p>The five things known in consummate serenity.</p>

					<p>[1] Thinking:</p>

					<p>'This serenity arises as happiness in the present and will have pleasant results in the future,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p>[2] Thinking:</p>

					<p>'This serenity is Aristocratic, not carnal,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p>[3] Thinking:</p>

					<p>'This serenity is not given flight by a bad person,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p>[4] Thinking:</p>

					<p>'This serenity is tranquil, exalted, has gained repose, reached the development of concentration, and is not own-made — deprecated — objectionable,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p>[5] Thinking:</p>

					<p>'Additionally then, this "I", minding, enters upon this serenity; minding, emerges,' such knowledge arises as personal experience.</p>

					<p>These five things should be produced.</p>

					<p>There are a couple of things in this to note: First is the last where the statement is being made that there is minding in both entering and emerging from <i>jhāna.</i> That is <i>"Samāpajjati"</i> "entering into" and there is no reason to think that this should be understood as 'once entering into the minding stops.' In fact as I read it the idea is that the minding is unbroken from entry to exit.</p>

					<p>Secondly, there is the statement that <b>'this <i>samādhi</i>' is not own-made <i>(saŋkhāra).</i></b> This is easily mistaken for the statement that the <i>jhāna</i> is not own-made (where we know that right up to the ending of sense-experience and perception the <i>jhānas</i> are own-made, but that is not what it is saying, it is saying that the <i>samādhi</i> that results from <i>jhāna</i> is not own-made. This then describes what I have claimed to be the case with regard to the unseen consciousness <i>(vinnana anidassana)</i> that is equal to <i>Nibbāna:</i> that it IS conditioned <i>(paccaya)</i> by following the <i>Magga,</i> but that it is a secondary product arising from the conditioning, it has arisen without intentional input <i>(sankhara).</i> ... and it has arisen, it is not something that was there that is arrived at.</p>

					<p>Another thing. Really important. The instructions for attaining the <i>Akincanna</i> Realm, there is an instruction: Thinking: <i>'N'atthi kiñcī' ti</i> "There is nothing there". This is to be taken literally! You are to think the thought: "There is nothing there." Over and over and eventually there will arise the perception that there is nothing there. The power of the word! This is not an instruction to intellectually analyze the physics of Nothingness. And this thinking which is word-thought, is described in all cases as occurring after the fourth <i>jhāna.</i></p>
