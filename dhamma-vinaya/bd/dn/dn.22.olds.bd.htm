					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> 'I'm just tell'n you what I'm hearing. The story most people have heard is that this line (<i>Evam me Sutam</i> — usually translated 'Thus I have heard') was originally spoken by Ānanda at the first council as he recited from memory all he had heard. There is another story. This is the way a seer will begin when he is going to tell you what he has 'heard' in his meditations on a certain subject. In this translation I am going to tell you what I hear in this way but 'reflected off' — <i>(as it carefully adheres to)</i> the 'script' we have in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.22.pali.bd.htm">the <i>Pāḷi</i> version</a> of this spell.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> I hear this spell (or the spell that was originally delivered as this spell) was cast in front of an audience of a thousand seers on what in the USA would be known as Halloween Night.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Ekāyano.</i> It is almost obligatory for a translator of the <i>Satipatthana</i> to footnote this term. It is clear that the two camps are: those who would wish to suggest that not only was This Practice The One and Only Way (among thousands and thousands described in the suttas ... which do, it is true, all come down to the same method) but that by extension Buddhism is the one and only way. Others that fall into this 'one and only way' camp include those who would rather not have to wade through the other 83,000 suttas of the <i>Tipitaka.</i> The other camp is made up of those who are trying to figure out how to say this in such a way that it does not imply that this practice or system is the one and only way (like the field/ground studies in psychology; they fail to see that this method is just a restatement of the same method used throughout the suttas, that is to say, essentially, the Four Truths). I have got a completely different take. The Buddha himself, no doubt anticipating this very debate, has suggested how to arrive at the meaning. He tells us straight out that it was because this way leads one who even only practices [perfectly] for seven days to either non-returning or Arahantship in this very life. Its got only one goal. It has a very narrow scope. The outcome is sure. Take a look; in one way we can say that the entire sutta is constructed so as to explain the meaning of <i>'ekayano'.</i> This is a way to overcome <i>dukkha;</i> culminating in non-returning or higher.<br />
					[If practiced impeccably!]<br />
					On the other hand, for a different take on what is going on here, see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.54.001.olds.bd.htm#n2">SN 5.54.1, n.2</a><br />
					Bhk. Nanavira and <i>Bhk.</i> Nanamoli also see the meaning of this term approximately as I have it here. See: Nanavira, <i>'ekayano'.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup><i>Parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā.</i> Whatever the translators of this phrase finally agree on, this means in practice that the meditator is to make sure (mind) that the various muscles associated with (<i>pari</i> — around) the organs of the face (<i>mukham</i>) (especially around the eyes, at the corners of the nose and mouth, and the set of the teeth) are as free from tension as possible.<br />
					Woodward translates: "setting mindfulness in front of him" and interprets according to the hindu-yoga tradition "Between the eyebrows, where the Hindus place the brow-<i>cakram</i>."<br />
					<i>Bhikkhu</i> Bodhi translates: "set up mindfulness in front of him" and quotes commentary: "...Vibh 252,14-16 says: 'This mindfulness is set up, well set up at the tip of the nose or at the center of the upper lip.'<br />
					<b><i>Path of Purity:</i></b> <i>"Establishing his mindfulness in front"</i> means, setting his mindfulness in the direction of the subject of meditation. Or, <i>pari</i> (in <i>parimukhaṃ</i> "in front") has the meaning of "grasping all round"; <i>mukhaṃ</i> of "going out from"; <i>sati</i> (mindfulness) of "being present," and it is therefore said to be <i>parimukhaṃ sati.</i> According to the version of the <i>Paṭisambhidā,</i> [i, 176] of which the following is an abstract: setting up mindfulness concerning a going forth which is thoroughly grasped."<br />
					I see the meaning as bringing the mind to the area around the mouth for the purposes of setting up a center or starting point for the establishment of the organized mind.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Bhamakāro.</i> "string-maker" or 'spin-maker'. Walshe, Rhys Davids, <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro, Horner and others: 'Turner'. This could be a lute player (? long note, short note); a turner (lathe worker) or potter (also called a turner), both giving difficulty with the idea of pulling long or short (the lathe or potting wheel is turned by pulling on a rope wound round a spindle that reverses gears when the rope has been fully pulled out and allowed to rewind around the spindle thus allowing a second pull...but there is nothing in the mechanism that would allow for short or long pulls; a top (toy) spinner, also with issues with regard to the long and short pulls; or we could just take the word at face value and say this is a spinner (of yarn or thread, i.e., sutta — where now it it necessary to pull out the wool long, and where now it is necessary to pull out the wool only slightly). Two appeal to me: The Potter because of the relation to a sub-meaning of Bhagavā; and 'spinner' because of the relationship to 'spinning' a 'sutta' (string, story, or spell). But did spinners have apprentices?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The brain (not in this version) is not included in all versions of this list. I hear it was only inserted by those following the commentary. Here I am going to side with the commentary for once. This is at one level a joke. Here I think the commentator had vision. He got the joke (The location of the brain — Where most people's minds are located; 'His mind is in the gutter' is how it is often put in English.). This idea is reflected elsewhere in similes. For example below in the charnel ground images there is one that describes the bones, now scattered, with the skull located at the pelvis; this occurs again in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.olds.bd.htm#p9">SN:NV. 17:9</a> where the bird that is torn apart has its head located at its tail feathers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This is another 'joke'. We in the modern west, with our flushing toilets will have a difficult time relating to this one, but the reader is reminded that when he opens that bag of his at the one end, a day, a few days, sometimes just an hour later what he puts in comes out when he opens up the other end, and a man with eyes in his head that can see can see: 'Here is that rice and beans, here is that potato I swallowed whole, etc.' Please note here also the Freudian-like symbolism of the corn, husked and ready for boiling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Fine quality rice husked and with the black grains removed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> I have reversed the order on the last two sets to follow the usual and instructive way lists are ordered in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> that is, proceeding from the lower state to the better state. There is another possibility: that this points to (leaves off at) the reality of the situation in the listener.</p>
