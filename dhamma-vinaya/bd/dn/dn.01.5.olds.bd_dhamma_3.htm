					<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the thinking and reflection associated with this state is considered excessive. But when this self has got rid of the thinking and reflection associated with this state, in full enjoyment of the sense of ease and enthusiasm resulting from getting high apart from thinking and reflection, with the mind subjectively tranquilized and concentrated, arrives at and stays in the Second Burning, then The self is in the highest <i>Nibbāna</i> here amidst visible things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">How come?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the mind is excited by enthusiasm associated with this state and this is considered excessive. But when this self has got rid of the excitement of enthusiasm, lives objectively detached, alert, and experiencing for himself that pleasant ease described by the Aristocrats as 'detached in mind, he lives at ease", arrives at and stays in the third burning, then the self is in the highest <i>Nibbāna</i> here amidst visible things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the mind's obsession with ease is considered excessive. But when this self has let go of both pain and pleasure; has let mental ease and mental pain subside, and while alert and experiencing the state of utterly purified detachment enters on and stays in the fourth burning, then the self is in the highest <i>Nibbāna</i> here amidst visible things.'</p>

And because he does not cling to what he sees he is objectively detached and he experiences for himself the peace of utter freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are advanced things, Beggars, matters that are deep, difficult to see, difficult to grasp, subtle, leading one who follows to tranquility and the sublime; things not to be arrived at by mere logic and reasoning, comprehensible only by the wise. These, Beggars are the things the <i>Tathāgata</i> teaches, having seen them for himself. These are the things which should be spoken of by one when he speaks in praise of the <i>Tathāgata</i>.</p>
