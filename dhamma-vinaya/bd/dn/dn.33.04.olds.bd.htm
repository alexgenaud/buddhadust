					ākāsānañcāyatanaɱ, etc: Looking at this compound one can see: There is no 'limitless' there. He thinks (or says): 'Space is Endless, or Limitless,' but the name of the ayatana itself does not contain the term 'limitless or endless.' So here we are not justified in saying he enters the sphere, or realm of Limitless Space. We must say he enters the Realm of Space. Given that, I think we have a much more commonly understood description of the phenomena attained, if we use the term 'Dimension.' And I would suggest that this is what is understood by modern physics as the 5th Dimension. We have 'length' and 'width' and 'height' and 'Time' and the 5th Dimension is sort of like looking at the world as though it were a hologram, you can see it all from all directions, but you are not "in" it. '...not scrutinizing perceptions of diversity (nānatta)': then becomes much more easily understood as 'Time' or the phenomena perceived as time, that is, the swift flow of changes in materiality, that like a movie, produces the illusion of continuity...for it is the question: 'How can I be seeing this, from outside, and account for Time?' that causes one to re-enter the ordinary world from this dimension: 'How does one emerge from the ākāsānañcāyatanaɱ? By paying attention to all forms, perceptions of resistance, and scrutinizing perceptions of diversity.'</p>

The thesis is the world we normally perceive. The antithesis breaks this world into The Material (what in physics is referred to as "space", that which occupies space — length, width, and height) and Time. Space and Time cannot exist independantly of each other and are held together by what the Physicists are calling the 5th Dimension (what is, in the Pali, the Dimension of Space): Space/Time (observed from without). The 5th Dimension becomes the new Thesis. The Antithesis then becomes Materiality and Time and the Dimension of Space. But examining it, one quickly concludes that should this have any actual basis in reality, it would tear itself to shreds. Just look at any one physical, apparently unchanging, thing in your environment while making yourself simultaneously aware of something else that is clearly changing (such as the second hand of a watch to make it easy). It obviously cannot be happening as it is perceived: The one, apparently unchanging physical thing exists in the same "Time Frame" as the clearly changing thing. This drives the perception that the apparently unchanging thing is in fact changing, but on the molecular level. This then drives one to the conclusion that even the molecules must be changing. If there is nothing there that is not changing, then there is No Thing There. Next up from there is the inevitable conclusion that one must in fact be inhabiting a Dimension in which there is neither perception (you can't perceive what isn't there) nor non-perception (you can't not be perceiving what you are perceiving, or in the Buddhist sense, perception is occuring, but it is an impersonal, mechanical thing, essentially a reaction among elements).<br />
					Now I hear a Zen master and a student of the Abhidhamma out there and they are both saying "This is just hocum. Sophistry. Logic and Reasoning. Beating out with the mind some theoretical construct to account for experience!"<br />

					Walshe and Rhys Davids go to the "devices" from these terms. The assertion here is that the 'devices' are late, artificial inventions (swaddlings). There is a situation in Dhamma practice where the idea that everything boils down to being Dukkha, and where Samadhi — getting high or getting clearly focused — results in having certain perceptions of an extraordinarily disagreeable nature. Absolutely repulsive and more than a little disturbing. But also highly stimulative of energetic effort, wakefulness and dispassion. These images can come in the form of visions in meditation, dream images, daydreams, and seeing something in "real life". These are not practices, but results, and the images are not restricted to things like human corpses or the degradation of human corpses. I have been for years repelled by a certain Austrialian bush in my garden called the bottle-brush which creates "pocks" on it's stems when it sheds its flowers. The other night on <i>Animal Planet</i> there was a sequence showing a frog that gave birth to it's infants from pores in it's back which "I cannot get out of my mind". I mentioned here once a persistant dream image of removing garlic cloves from between my toes. There are states in which one can see "all this" as a skeleton, or where one sees the skin peel back revealing the bones, or where one sees the rot of the body in a variety of ways. I have seen images of my arm filled with maggots. Many of us have had dreams of running or being chased through a land filled with holes into which we are liable to sink. Allowed to generate fear and without context these can be psychologically damaging phenomena. In the context of the Buddha's Dhamma they are very valuable in generating effort (this is a tool to keep in mind during periods of sloth ... <i>viriya-sambojjhanga</i>: the science of energy building), and it is because these visions have been recognized for their usefulness that "devices" were made from them.</p>

It is by intent and conduct and attainment that one is worthy of such. The description of the hand jesure in the Pali is covered by the phrase <i>añjali-karaṇīyo;</i> I didn't think it would hurt to have a full description for the benefit of those of us in the west who may be unfamiliar with this reverential form of greeting.<br />
					On this also see Bhikkhu Bodhi: Going for Refuge on Access to Insight (scroll down): ". . . the order of monks is not itself the Saŋgha which takes the position of the third refuge. The Saŋgha which serves as refuge is not an institutional body but an unchartered spiritual community comprising all those who have achieved penetration of the innermost meaning of the Buddha's teaching. The Saŋgha-refuge is the ariyan Saŋgha, the noble community, made up exclusively of ariyans, person of superior spiritual stature. Its membership is not bound together by formal ecclesiastical ties but by the invisible bond of a common inward realization. The one requirement for admission is the attainment of this realization, which in itself is sufficient to grant entrance."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> The way I read Rhys Davids, Walshe and most other translators is that the string of descriptive terms is to apply to the way the streamwinner practices ethical culture. I have them describing the nature of the ethical culture he strives after attaining. I here put forward two arguments for my interpretation: 1. The string of terms includes two (<i>viññūppasatthehi</i> — praised by the wise (there is some doubt about the meaning of this word; it could also mean undisturbed) — and <i>samādhi-saŋvattanikehi</i> — that evolves into highgetting) that seem to me to not apply to the practitioner but to the ethical culture itself, and 2. It is clear from numerous passages in the Suttas that the Streamwinner may not have fully developed such perfection in his behavior. The big advantage of becoming a streamwinner that is put out there (and which one is perperported to be seeabel for one's self) is the fact that one will not backlslide to such a degree that one will perform any act (thought, word, or deed) that will result in rebirth in Hell, as a Demon or as an Animal. There are passages that state that even one with no greater personal development than what we can assume is unreasoned (but steadfast) faith in the Buddha can be called a Streamwinner. This is not being said here in any effort to weaken the importance of perfecting one's self in ethical culture, but to eliminate the discouragement of those who are doing their best and occasionally fall short.</p>

The idea here is easy enough (stuff people actually eat for nourishment), but finding a word for it is not. This term is further defined as "either o'āriko or sukhumo; gross or coarse, or subtle. And subtle here most likely applies to the food enjoyed by the gods as well as that enjoyed by man: in other words, it could also mean such food as being nourished on friendly vibrations and <i>pitī</i> or Enthusiasm (although this might fall under the category of "sense stimulation" as food), or on scents as for some gods that reside nearby.<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> <i>Cattāri agati-gamanāni.</i><br />
					<i>agatiɱ- gacchati</i>: Rhys Davids has 'going astray' and notes: literally, he goes to a not-going, or wrong going, or impasse. Walshe has 'going wrong'.<br />
					<i>gati:</i> PED: 1. going, going away; 2. going away, passing on, course, esp. after death, destiny, as regards another (future) existence; 3. behavior, state or condition of life, sphere of existence, element, especially characterized as sugati and duggati, a happy or an unhappy existence; 4. one of the five relms of existence of sentient beings — agati: 1. no course, no access; 2. = duggati, a wrong course<br />
					A-Gati is Not-Going. Since "Gati" is used both in the form of "got" or "having gotten" and in the form of "gone," what we probably need for a-gata is not going-wrong (which is a "having got"), but either "not getting" or "not going/getting where/what we would wish."<br />
					I am taking this as word-play, based on the idea that in this system the only acceptable "getting" is Nibbāna or at least one of the stages on the way to Nibbāna, so the meaning is, here, he doesn't "get" Nibbāna because he has not "got going" because of X.</p>

					<i>dhamma-samādānaɱ:</i> PED: <i>Samādāna</i> 2. taking upon oneself, undertaking, acquiring<br />
					Walshe: undertaking dhamma; Rhys Davids: religious undertakings. Rhys Davids understanding being that the term 'dhamma' here applies to all religious systems. Walsh's rendering is unclear in that it is hard to imagine the undertaking of the Buddha's Dhamma which is both of immediate painful results and which will result in pain in the future. One could undertake Dhamma wrongly, but would this be undertaking Dhamma? So "things."<br />
					<i>paccuppannaɱ:</i> PED: [pp. of <i>paṭi+uppajjati</i>, cp. Sk. <i>pratyutpanna</i>] what has arisen (just now), existing, present (as opposed to <i>atīta</i> past &amp; <i>anāgata</i> future) This term nicely reflects the Buddhist position that all things arise as a consequence of conditions, so that which is experienced in the present is something that is already the consequence of something done in the past. "If you do this now, the results will have had this effect upon being experienced."<br />
					This is the case that apparently results in what we in The US think of as 'the Indian accent' [Indian English syntax]. "I am having had such troubles rendering this expression." Definately not easy to render into English.<br />
					vipākaɱ: PED: fruit, fruition, product; always in pregnant meaning of "result, effect, consequence (of one's action)," either as good &amp; meritorious (<i>kusala</i>) or bad &amp; detrimental (<i>akusala</i>). Hence "retribution" (<i>kamma-</i>), reward or punishment.<br />
					My translation above is given with some recollection of the details of each category where we would understand it in terms such as "short-term thinking" (do what feels good and don't worry about the consequences) and "long-term thinking" (accept the fact that some things are difficult to accomplish but worth the effort). This would be my best effort at an accurate translation:<br />
					Four ways of taking things on:<br />
					There is, friends, the taking on of things which will have had painful results and will thereafter have a painful impact.<br />
					There is, friends, the taking on of things which will have had painful results but will thereafter have a pleasant impact.<br />
					There is, friends, the taking on of things which will have had pleasurable results but will thereafter have a painful impact.<br />

					<i>Adhiṭṭhāna</i> 1. decision, resolution, self-determination, will, D III.229 (where 4 are enumd., viz. <i>paññā-, sacca- cāga- upasama-</i>). - 2. mentioned in bad sense with <i>abhinivesa</i> and <i>anusaya,</i> obstinacy, prejudice and bias M I.136; III.31, 240; S II.17; III.10, 135, 194. - As adj. applying oneself to, bent on A III.363. - 3. looking after, management, direction, power.<br />
					<i>Adhiṭṭhita</i> 1. standing on (c. loc.), esp. with the idea of standing above, towering over. - (a) looked after, managed, undertaken, governed. - (b) undertaking, bent on.<br />
					One is not limited to one stand, but it is clear from looking around that beings tend towards a preference for one or another of these stands over the others. This is somewhat like Don Juan's attitude towards Death: that is, that knowing Death will win the game one does one's dance with impeccability.</p>

See also cakkhu &amp; cp. <i>akkha</i><sup>2</sup> &amp; <i>ikkhaṇika</i>] the eye M I.383. In combn with sa- as <i>sacchi &amp; sakkhi</i>.</span><br />
					I am going to go way out on a limb here and say that we get to Sacchi from Akkhi by way of sacca: we see the truth or see a thing is true or 'seeing is believing'.<br />
					The translations of both Rhys Davids and Walshe are either confused or are uniform but are using "realized" in the sense of 'made become'. The first two instances of each could be either way (It took me hours and hours to figure that out, it was like one of those images that look like a face then look like a jar and when you look at the jar you forgot how you could see it as a face...about a finger snap away from a major headache); the other way round they would indicate that 'the fact of the existence of (former lives, death and rebirth) is to be seen using (memory, the eye)'; whereas in the second two they would indicate that 'the state of having made real the experience of (the 8 releases, destruction of the āsavas) is to be made to happen using (body (which they understand to be mind) and wisdom).<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					Walshe: "Four things to be realised by seeing:<br />
					former lives, to be realised by recollection<br />
					passing-away and rearising to be realised by the (devine) eye<br />
					the eight deliverances, to be realised with the mental body<br />
					the destruction of the corruptions, to be realised by wisdom."<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					Rhys Davids: "Four matters to be realized:<br />
					former lives, to be realized by clear mentality<br />
					decease and rebirth, to be realized by the 'heavenly eye'<br />
					the eight deliverances, to be realized by all the mental factors<br />
					destruction of intoxicants, to be realized by insight."<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					I think this can only be taken in the sense of "One may come to recognize the fact that one is lost with the aid of a map (i.e., the map does not cause one to be lost)." In other words I have '<i>sacchikaraniya</i>' as indicating the process of arrival at a state of 'seeing' (having become conscious of a thing), which interpretation has the modifiers (memory, eye, body, wisdom) as the 'medium' dependant upon which the realization takes place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> <i>kāyena</i>: Both Walshe and Rhys Davids rely on the Abhidhamma interpretation which forces this from meaning body as it is usually used in the suttas into meaning Mind (PED: ...Abhidhamma distinguished <i>kāya</i> as = the <i>cetasikas</i> (mental properties, or the <i>vedanā, saññā</i> and <i>sankhārā khandhas</i>), body being excluded...)(and I think this also warps the meaning of <i>sankhara</i>). This, in turn, forces the meaning of <i>kāyasakkin</i> to be the "mental realizer" of Horner.<br />
					It may well be that it is here in this sutta that the Abhidhamma idea began: if the modifiers are methods rather than mediums, and the <i>arupajhanas</i> are purely mental, then it would not be possible to use the body to attain these <i>vimokkhas,</i> so <i>kaya</i> must be made to be "mind-body" or the body of things making up what we understand to be mind. The whole issue is made much simpler by understanding the modifiers to be mediums: One may understand the 8 <i>vimokkhas</i> with (while still in the; or in the case of this sutta 'by way of reference to (or seeing) the bodily state') body.<br />

					Walshe: Floods: sensuality, becoming, (wrong) views, ignorance.<br />
					Rhys Davids: Floods: sensual desires, life renewed, error, ignorance.<br />
					Walshe's "(wrong) views:" 'wrong' here is unnecessary. In this system, essentially views are aways wrong. Having "Samma (High, Consummate)" View is the start of the path to the letting go of all views including Samma ditthi. Here Rhys Davids' "error" is more correct.<br />
					Rhys Davids "life renewed:" is a little misleading. Bhava, as either "living" or "becoming" or "development" is in fact a process of renewing life, but not necessarily in the sense of rebirth which I think the use here implies.</p>

					Perhaps to the "piece of cloth" always carried by Old Tibeggars used as a hankerchief, bib, towel, wrapper, whatsoever all in ordinary circumstances, but which gathers great magical power over time. When eating it is placed across the lap.<br />
					In Dialogs Rhys Davids translates: "knots; body-knot of covetousnes, etc., and footnotes Buddhist Psychological Ethics (PED: pp281) (1st book of the Abhidhamma, where Mrs Rhys Davids translates: " ti.s; bodily tie of covetousness..." and footnotes: "Gantho is defined as that which ties (or knots) or binds him for whom it exists on to the "circle" of re-birth. And the term <i>kayagantho</i> (body-tie) is used because the tying is effected through the body — that is, is got in conception and rebirth." This is reasonable. But Walshe reads the commentary and notes: "<i>Kaya</i> here means <i>nama-kaya</i> 'mental body'.<br />
					Note PED and BSE refer to these as <i>kayaganthas,</i> where this sutta calls them simply <i>ganthas.</i> To my perception this is just another way of describing <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#FundamentalAttachments">saŋyojanas</a>.<br />
					The meaning is that one who has covetousness, etc., has (shows evidence of, reveals a sign that he has) ties to a body, and that covetousness ties one to a body. It may be obvious to some but it might be helpful to others to spell this out: it is not possible to "want" witout "wanting for 'me'"; or to be angry 'at,' without a 'because this makes 'me' feel bad'; or to believe that the practice of good deeds, ethical culture and the performance of rites and rituals will result in the elimination of <i>dukkha</i> without a misunderstanding of the nature of <i>anatta</i>; or to hold on to the idea that there is any one single point of view about anything that is the one and only way of seeing it without having a misunderstanding of the <i>paticca samuppada</i> or the four truths.<br />

					or, restated another way:<br />
					Could there be any Living of any kind by any kind of being in any sort of realm of being if there were no "Going after Getting Life" by any kind of being in any sort of realm of being?<br />
					Answering correctly, the answer should be: 'No'.<br />
					Therefore Living arises dependant on Going After Getting.</p>

					<i>Jalābu</i> 1. the womb - 2. the embryo - 3. the placenta<br />
					The distinguishing difference between the egg-born and the embryo born is in the direct linkage and contact (or absense of such) of the embryo  with the mother.<br />
					<i>Seda (+saŋ)</i> sweat. Usually as above "moisture" but this may actually be indicating a view more consistant with the way it would look to the modern scientist: mitosis, the process of division whereby a cell divides to form two identical cells, something that has a strong resemblance to sweating<br />
					<i>Opapātika</i> arisen or reborn without visible cause (i. e. without parents), spontaneous rebirth, apparitional rebirth D I.27, 55, 156; III.132, 230 (-yoni), 265; M I.34, 73, 287, 401 sq., 436 sq, 465 sq.; II.52; III.22, 80, 247; S III.206, 240 sq., 246 sq.; IV.348; V.346, 357 sq., 406; A I.232, 245, 269; II.5, 89, 186; IV.12, 226, 399, 423 sq.; V. 265 sq., 286 sq., 343 sq.<br />
					This is most important to Buddhists in that it is the manner in which the Non-returner is reborn into his final life, often, but not exclusively in the Sudhavassa Realms. Others are even reborn here in this manner. This is the manner in which those who were previously in the Asanna realm are reborn when a thought occurs to them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> <i>Cattāro attabhāva-paṭilābhā.</i><br />

					<i>attabhāva-paṭilābhā:</i> attaining-becoming-regaining or attaining-living-regaining<br />
					Rhys Davids notes: "The second of these is illustrated by the slaughter of an animal by a butcher. The other three cases are referred to the decease and rebirth of the devas referred to in Vol.I, pp. 32 and 33 and of other devas respectively."<br />
					I make these out a little differently in the case of the final one. Case one is clearly the situation where after death or at death one intends rebirth of some sort or another. The second case is where one's life has been prematurely cut short by another and no intent has been formed by the individual himself (kamma dictates the rebirth, but it has been effected by the killer). The third case, apparently, is where one is identifying as one's own the intent of another (as in the case of those individuals deceasing from the Abhisara realm to be reborn with Brahma at the time of his wishing for companionship) or of those identifying with the implied intent of a dominant idea (such as lust, for example the making real of some sexual fantasy). I see the fourth case as being the case of the non-returner, or possibly the once-returner where there is no need of intent as there are no choices in terms of intentions concerning being reborn left (There remains the possibility to intend not to be reborn, but that would not be a case of attaining the regaining of life.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> <i>Catasso dakkhiṇā-visuddhiyo.</i><br />
					If you read any of the early non-Buddhist texts you will note the big place "purification" played in the everyday lives of people of the time. We still have plenty of this today both as superstitious ritual (as in food taboos) and in our daily habits of cleanliness (many of which are superstitions). My thinking is that the idea of purification came out of the observation that under certain conditions (impure states) some foods were poisonous. This idea was then generalized to conduct and further broadened to include factors influencing the afterlife. Here the idea has been interpreted to mean the manner in which a gift becomes effective in providing benefit to a second party, such as a departed relative. It is pretty clear that this is a debunked idea from the point of view of the Pali. We have one case, where some person was making a very generous gift of a meal to the Buddha where in fact the gift was made up from donations given to this man by his friends. He made the wish to the Buddha: "May the benefit go to those who provided these gifts." The Buddha's response was to say: "Those people will receive the benefit of having given to an unenlightened one such as are you. You will get the benefit of having given to an enlightened one such as I." In another case the Buddha is observing funeral rites in which some people are saying about a dead man: "May his soul rise up to heaven, may his soul rise up to heaven!" And he observes that this is no more effective in causing this man to go to heaven than it would be possible to raise a stone from water's depths by wishing: "May this rock rise up! May this rock rise up!" It is by way of an individual's deeds that good or bad kamma is created, not by what another may wish for one. The basic principle of "transferring merit" goes against the whole idea of kamma.<br />
					So, given that this segment of this sutta is Dhamma (and the idea here does come up elsewhere), what is intended here? What we can have in connection with a gift, are several factors which inhance the potency of the rebound which may be anticipated from a deed: First is intent concerning the outcome for the doer of the deed (A spectrum of such expectations is often given, from rebirth in a wealthy family here, to rebirth in some grand heavenly state, to purification of the mind (see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.33.08.olds.bd.htm#p8.7">8s#7</a> for such a list). A gift given without such an intent is considered to be a deed that has been carelessly done, the effectiveness of intent in producing that outcome is related to it's clarity, and the clarity is related to the objective detachment of giver and receiver. In addition, giving without regret, giving with trust in the potency of good deeds, giving by one's own hand (the real meaning of <i>dakkhiṇā,</i> giving good clean things and useful things are other factors that influence the potency of a gift.<br />
					So here the matter breaks down to the case where the giver is or is not clear as to his intent, and takes good care in the other matters concerning the gift; or you have the case where the recipient is one who is or is not, by way of his objective detachment capable of turning even a poorly executed deed into one of potent results. The best outcome to be hoped for is in the case of the fourth case.

					<i>Mussati</i> to forget, to pass into oblivion, to become bewildered, to become careless<br />
					This comes to our: Mis-taken, which could be taken for both intentional and unintentional false speech. "I must have mistaken myself," for having said something untrue; later to "I must have misspoken". Note with reference to discussions of "<i>samma</i>" and "<i>micchā</i>" where I hold that both these terms have been ...um...taken wrongly (see the discussion of terminology at the top of Lesson 8: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualesson8.htm#topalesson8">Samma</a>.)

					<i>Samphappalāpā:</i> I don't know where I saw this defined (probably discussed in the texts), I can't find it in PED, but what I heard was something like "drooling lip-flapper".<br />
					I believe my translation above would be heard correctly by an aristocrat even today, but most of us would not understand the subtlties, so for a more spelled-out version:<br />
					"Untrue speech (intentional or otherwise; the aristocrat is to deliberate before speaking), crude language (in the society of the time this did not carry the same meaning as it does here — USA — today — 24 Aug 2002 —; it would not have been considered use of crude language to describe, for example "excrement" as "shit"; the idea is cursing for cursing's sake; there is pleny'nuf good reason to fear the power of words without fearing the words themselves.), injurious speech (speech intended to hurt), talk not focused on the goal (for this note the behavior of the Anuruddha's, where even communicating every day needs was considered an unfit topic for "breaking into speech.")<br />
