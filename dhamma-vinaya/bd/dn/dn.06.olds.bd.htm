					<p class="f4">At that time then a great number of Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys were dwelling in Vesali doing whatever they were supposed to be doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys heard:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"A shaman indeed, good Gotama, Sakyan-son, renunciate of the Sakyan clan is revisiting Vesali, the Great Woods, Peaked-roof hall.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">Of that Lucky Man Gotama good rumor has it thus:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>'This is without doubt The Lucky Man, Arahant, consummately-self-awakened, possessed of vision and conduct, well-gone, worldly-wise, unsurpassed Dhamma-driver of persons, master of gods and men, Awake, The Lucky Man.'</i></p>

						<p class="f4 in1">He, seeing with his own eyes by his own higher-knowledge this world with it's gods, with it's Mara's, with it's Brahmas, with it's shamen and brahmins, gives the word to this generation of gods and men.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">He declares Dhamma: at the start, helpful; in the middle, helpful; at the conclusion, helpful.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">It is well, indeed, to get to see sucha sight — an Arahant, exemplifying perfect fullfilment of the thoroughly purified Brahma carriage."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p2" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.06.pali.bd.htm#p2">2.</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#p2">pts</a>]</span> Then those Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys approached Great Woods, Peaked-roof-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Ancient Nagito was the personal attendant of The Lucky Man so those Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys approached the Ancient Nagito.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached the Ancient Nagito, they said to him:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"Where then, good Nagita,<br />
						might Gotama be at present residing?</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">May we have the pleasure of seeing that Lucky Man?"</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"It is now untimely, friends, to see The Lucky Man —<br />
						in secluded chambers is The Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys just there took seats to one side, saying:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"When we have had sight of that Lucky Man Gotama we will return home."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p3" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.06.pali.bd.htm#p3">3.</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#p3">pts</a>]</span> Just then Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis drew near Great Woods, Peaked-roof-hall and approached the Ancient Nagito.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached the Ancient Nagito, they gave salutation and stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side Otthaddho the Licchavi said this to the Ancient Nagito:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"Where then, good Nagita,<br />

						<p class="f4 in1">We would have the pleasure of seeing that Lucky Man, Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened."</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"It is now untimely, Mahali, to see The Lucky Man —<br />
						in secluded chambers is The Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">Otthaddho the Licchavi just there took a seat to one side, saying:</p>

					    <p class="f4 in1">"Seen 'or I return home will be The Lucky Man, Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened."</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near, saluting the Ancient Nagita, he stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side, then, Siho the apprentice said this to the Ancient Nagita:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"Bhante Kassapa, these Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys have come here to see The Lucky Man —<br />
						Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis too has come here to see The Lucky Man.</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">It would be well, bhante Kassapa, that these people gain sucha sight."</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"Well then Siha,<br />
						just you announce them to the Lucky Man."</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"Even so, bhante," Siha the apprentice then said in reply to the Ancient Nagita.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then approaching The Lucky Man,<br />
					having approached the Lucky Man and saluted,<br />
					he stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side then,<br />
					Siha the apprentice said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">It would be well, bhante, that these people gain sight of the Lucky Man."</p>

						<p class="f4 in1">"In that case, Siha, spread out a seat in the shade of the residence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then "Even so, bhante" said Siha the Apprentice to The Lucky Man in reply<br />
					and he spread out a seat in the shade of the residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man came out of his residence and took the seat prepared in the shade of the vihara.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p5" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.06.pali.bd.htm#p5">5.</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#p5">pts</a>]</span> There then those Kosalan brahman-envoys and Magadhan brahman-envoys approached The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached The Lucky Man they conversed together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having conversed together, making friendly exchanges, they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis too approached and conversed together with The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached The Lucky Man they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Otthaddho the Licchavi said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup><i>Ko nu kho bhante hetu ko paccayo.</i> 'Hetu' is 'driving force'. PED states that it is from 'hi', to impel. 'Hi!' or 'Hi-ya!' 'Giddy-up'. This is the word at the lowest most timeless level. 'On account of what is the result that'. 'Reason' and 'Cause' would do if heard as generally used in American English, but not if understood precisely. It isn't a 'cause' in the sense of making a thing happen or not happen. The driver can crack the whip, but it can't make the horse drink. It is a or the primary or operant factor in the making of a thing happen. It is not a or the 'reason' because it is a force, not a static condidition. The crack of the whip is the reason the horse gets moving, but that is not the 'hetu', what impells it. What impells it to move, the driver, the hetu, is the force of the fear of the touch of the whip. It is the force of Sunakkhatto Licchaviputto's intent to see sights in a single direction that is preventing him from hearing sounds. He has an 'idea' in his methodology that is a force in operation against the outcome he, in another frame of mind, wants to achieve. We would probably just say: 'Why doesn't he hear such sounds?" But if the question had been put to Gotama that way then the answer would likely have been: 'Because he is employing an incorrect method for the attaining of that result.' And to get to the details another question would need to be asked. In translating 'hetu' we need to imply 'driving-force' as in the driver of a chariot, while avoiding the idea that that force is the single thing making a certain thing happen or not happen.<br />
					The phrase also could be rendered: What is the precurser driver ... driving force ..., or<br />
					What is the requisite driver ... driving force,<br />
					Some will note I translate the term <i>Taɱ kissa hetu?</i> as 'How come?' ['What drives?'] This works for this phrase, but in the case under discussion it would need to be 'How comes the result (consequence, repercussion, requisite condition, condition) that' or 'how does it come about that the result is'. Ignoring the <i>'paccayo'</i> we could say: "How come?" but again in those days, with Gotama, that would likely have resulted in an unenlightening answer like: 'Because he used the wrong method.' The questioner wants to know how to practice to both hear the sounds and see the sights. Likely his retinue is a group of students and he is asking this question to dispell doubts and teach them the method.<br />
					We might say: 'How does it end up that?'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This section down to the end of this group and the similar sections in the next two groups are not included in either The PTS Pali or Rhys David's translation, though apparently existing in Rhys Davids personal version of the Pali of this sutta. BJT includes these paragraphs (with some differences that look to have resulted from 'copy and paste' errors.) Without straightening out the lines and paragraphs, seeing this in the original which is just one single run-in line, this is a massively confusing bit of text.<br />
					The inclusion of these paragraphs deliniates with a fine-grained precision the ideas under examination: "When this is done, that is the result; when he practices this way, he experiences that result; when a beggar practicing this way experiences that result, this is the driver for that result; this is the driver which results in this happening to Sunakkhatto Licchaviputto.<br />
					This done in this way is a form of hypnotic suggestion which in this case because of it's precision in following the exact sequence of thoughts the way they actually occur in the mind, would inspire great confidence in the ability of the speaker to be one who 'knows and sees'.<br />
					Without this detail there is a discontinuity that would be disturbing: the question asked is why Sunakkhatto Licchaviputto does not hear divine sounds, but we are given, as well as a response to that, the driving force resulting in hearing or not hearing divine sounds, seeing or not seeing divine sights, and both seeing divine sights and hearing divine sounds. The 'extra' details are needed to show that the answer is still really just to the original question and is not a digression.<br />
					But what patience there must have been on both sides to go through this like this!<br />
					But what a reward for doing so!<br />
					There is another similar situation in the suttas where Anuruddha is perplexed as to why he is able to see 'the light' sometimes but not 'forms' and sometimes is able to see 'forms' but not 'the light'. The mechanism is similar, but in his case involving over anxiousness or disinterest with regard to the experience of the one or the other. Gotama in this sutta speaks of having had the same experience himself.<br />
					Something else is likely to happen in the case as described here. A beggar practicing in one direction whether for the single experience of seeing sights or hearing sounds, or for the dual experience of seeing sights and hearing sounds, is going to find himself unable to do so in another direction. How come? Because his practice was in only one direction.<br />
					We can imagine this being spelled out fully for all 10 directions. ... and ... why not? Let's throw in seeing the light and seeing forms, and hearing sounds near and far, man-made or other-worldly.<br />
					Because experiencing such experiences is not the goal of the system, that's why not. To go as far as is provided in this sutta was done for the good reason that it is the only complete way to answer the question and for demonstration to Mahali and his followers of the precision of the Awakened mind. To go further would be to mis-direct. We get a sense of this issue with Mahali's follow-up question.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The meaning is that one has seen the error in [1] holding views as absolute truths, [2] trusting that good deeds, ethical behavior, rights, or rituals will bring one to the end of Pain, and [3] Doubt that the Dhamma will lead one who acts in accordance with it to the end of Pain, and that Gotama realized Awakening. This is elsewhere described as having 'unshakable faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha [where 'sangha' is understood to mean those who have attained one or another or all of the four stages that begin with Stream-entry]'. The idea that this amounts to blind faith should be avoided: this is faith that has been founded on the real perception of the error of views, trust in good deeds, etc.! That, stated another way is the perception that: 'There is no own-made thing that having come to be does not come to an end.' This is often the only way the attainment of Stream-entry is described.</p>

All these are out for this guy, not, as with Rhys Davids, just 'this world'.<br />

The word used here is <i>anāvatti-dhammo</i> 'non-back-falling-' where 'dhamma' apparently means 'of a nature' 'a thing that' and the statement is that he is not subject to falling from there. It is usually stated that he attains Arahantship half-way through the normal lifespan there.

The last is sometimes not given and is essentially covered by the third. The eradication of the āsavas given at the end of this sutta is included by reference to the description of the process in DN 2 where it has only the three. I do not recall having seen the process as it is given in DN 2 where the four are used. The term is also used in a broad way to indicate things that might cause distraction such as a tree-stump in one's path, uneven ground, a mad dog, etc. It might be better to translate it as 'disrupting influence'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Here it is: <i>"Kin nu kho āvuso bho Gotama,||<br />

					Literally: How then friend good Gotama, is it<br />
					'That-um life that-um body<br />
					or other-um life other-um body?' (end quote);<br />
					the direct question. I think this might be much clearer with the hand jestures that most likely accompanied the original question. Another more interesting hypothesis is that they were speaking with only basic knowledge of Pali or even that this is a remnant of the Pali that was in actual use. The fact that they address Gotama as 'friend' shows at least that they were unfamiliar with the etiquette of Gotama's sangha.<br />
					Subsequently in the sutta [<a href="#ti">see</a>] it will be:<br />
					<i>'"taɱ jīvaɱ taɱ sarīran" ti vā<br />
					"aññaɱ jīvaɱ aññaɱ sarīran" ti vā' ti.</i><br />
					'Is it said: "That life is that body"<br />
					or is it said:<br />
					"Life is a separate thing, the body is a separate thing?"' (end quote.)<br />
					This latter emphasizing that this is a proposition that there are only two points of view possible and that in this system neither proposition is acceptable.<br />
					As an aside it is useful to point out that this is a good example of why one needs to consult the Pali. Just reading the translation it would be highly probable that one would assume that what was being spoken of here was 'atta' and 'kaya'. More often than not 'jiva' would refer to 'life' or 'lifestyle' and 'kaya' would be used as a broader term for what was understood to be the form of an individual as opposed to 'physical body' as here. These two wanderers have this body and it's animating force in mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Sukha.</i> Sweetness. Sugar. Succor. Rhys Davids translation of this passage is especially beautiful:</p>

						<p class="f3 in4">'And gladness springs up within him<br />

						and joy arises to him thus gladdened,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Samādhiyati.</i> See above note, Rhys David's: 'stayed', presumably from the context, meaning settled down. PED: has: Passive of <i>samādahati</i> = sam + adhiyati, adhiyati = a dahati<sup>1</sup> English: 'to do', to put down, set up; [but it can be 'to lite' 'to burn']: which would be something like "to have begun," "to have started," "to have set up".<br />
					The issue is: is this a description of the first appearance of samādhi, serenity, or is this a description of the state where one has set up the conditions for samādhi? <i>Sammā Samādhi</i> is defined as the four <i>jhānas</i>, but samādhi is also a word for serene states other than the four jhānas. The translation here is saying that at this point a state of samādhi has been attained, that this is, in effect, a definition of samādhi. Walshe has 'concentrated,' meaning he has also taken this as 'one who has samadhi'. Note that this is not a description of ecstasy.<br />
					This is important to resolve for one who wishes to develop <i>Sammā Samādhi.</i> It is saying that one is, under these conditions, already in samādhi, has already become serene, prior to entering the first jhāna. We can then even return to the idea of <i>samādahati</i> understanding this state to have been the 'laying of the fire', the jhānas being the 'burning' itself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> This simile is one of the most perplexing passages in the suttas. That the connotation is sexual is beyond debate, but does this imply that the technique is similar to or identical with the sexual tantric method? Build up sexual sensations but do not bring it to the point of ...um... oozing moisture? This is contradicted by every instruction concerning 'kama' and even in the instructions concerning letting go of the involvements just preceding the first jhāna. That there are sexual references throughout the suttas cannot be denied, but in the other cases what is at work is a sort of mockery that relies on a phenomena discovered later by Freud wherein all human activity (especially note argument and contention) are subtle sublimations of the sexual drive. But in the case here the implication is to the nature of a practice and that is perplexing.<br />
					The compromise suggested here is that 'in the same way' as a person arouses sexual excitement within himself by conjuring erotic images, here the bhikkhu arouses peaceful enthusiasm by conjuring with thinking and pondering recollections of his former bound up state as contrasted with his later freed state ... without yet allowing his enthusiasm to 'spill' out into utterances or activities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>Kalla.</i> PED: 1. well, healthy, sound ...  2. clever, able, dexterous ...  3. ready, prepared  ...  4. fit, proper, right S II.13 <i>(pañha)</i>. - nt. kallaɱ it is proper, befitting (with inf. or inf.-substitute): <i>vacanāya</i> proper to say.<br />
					I have used 'reasonable' as pointing more clearly to our ears than 'propper' to the intent I see in the passage, that is, that up to the last point it would be reasonable to ask such a question, but that he himself would not do so.<br />
					Walshe, Rhys Davids and the commentaries see this as an exchange between the two Wanderers and Gotama whereas I have it as a rhetorical question answered by himself.<br />
					The Pali has the response put both ways in various versions [see <a href="../../pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#n26">Rhys Davids, n. 26,27</a>]. Rhys Davids has it: 'yes it would be' to the end and 'no' for the last. Walshe changes the sequence throughout to 'not-reasonable'. Buddhaghosa has it as a dialog, not a rhetorical question, but indicates the same sequence of responses as I have used here with explanation that the hypothetical bhikkhu being used as the example by Gotama has got Arahantship at this point. This at least is evidence that the early Pali was as here — saying it would be 'reasonable' up to the last but not in the last case.<br />
					Another thing: the Wanderers, when addressing Gotama are made in this story which is being spoken by Gotama, to address him as 'friend good Gotama' but here, where they are presumed to be speaking by Walshe, Rhys Davids and the commentary, only 'friend' is used. <i>Āvuso</i> can be 'friend' or 'friends'.<br />
					I think it is a much more powerful statement when made as it appears in the Pali and as I have rendered it here. ... it is 'reasonable' to ask, but it would be wiser to wait until one's knowing and seeing was that of the Arahant where it would no longer be reasonable to ask such a question because one sees that this is not relevant to leaving behind birth, living the Brahma life, finishing one's duties, ending one's journey through the being of any sort of it at any place of atness.</p>

					How does 'mete out', a 'measure' become creating a feat of 'conjuration'? Having relaxed the notion of self with regard to that kaya there, seeing it, for example, as simply a white splotch as in the fourth jhāna, one very carefully 'divides away' (in a process similar to, and maybe identical with mitosis) in measured amounts a bit at a time gradually bringing forth a separate entity complete in all it's parts.</p>

Relative to the scope of the observer, so limited to the class of 'being' that is observing. The person with this power is able to go out of this class of beings, beyond, into another and in that way becomes invisible in the original state. If the observer is also able to see beyond, he has not achieved this power relative to that observer.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>Ceto.</i> What we understand to be mental states. Here in this country at this time we do not much use the idea of 'heart' to describe the mind and we have no good term for the full scope of the objects of the heart. Emotions covers part, moods covers part, states of mind describes the phenomena that is going on in the heart but uses the wrong term in 'mind'. Mind needs to be understood in a larger context as encompassing all things mental from perception through emotions. Heart is bound up in the existence of the individual and it is that which is being encompassed here.<br />
					As pointed out in <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#EncompassingaHeart">The Pali Line</a>: we have here an example of a Dhamma used in one place for one purpose — in The Satipatthana Sutta, to set up knowledge, awareness, recollection of and release from mental states — the purpose of which is detachment, and the purpose of detachment clarity — and turning up in another place for another purpose — as the power of reading other's emotions and mental states. The training of the former is the training for the latter. The experience of the latter is the reason for the former.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>Singhāṭake.</i> It is not easy to see how this becomes 'square' or 'crossroads.' Apparently it evolves from 'saŋ' + Ghaṭeti = own-connection, joining, uniting, or 'saŋ' + 'Ghaṭa' = own crowd. Possibly gathering place becomes 'square'.<br />
					PED does not help, but has for:<br />
					Ghaṭeti [Denominitive from ghaṭa<sup>2</sup>, cp. gantheti] to join, to connect, to unite J I.139; frequent in anusandhiɱ ghaṭetvā adding the connection (between one rebirth and another) J I.220, 308.<br />
					Ghaṭa<sup>2</sup> (m. and f.) [Sanskrit ghaṭā; conn. with ganthati to bind together] multitude, heap, crowd, dense mass, i. e. thicket, cluster itthi- a crowd of women J IV.316; maccha- a swarm of fish J II.227; vana- dense forest J II.385; IV.56; V.502; VI.11, 519, 564; brahma- company of brahmins J VI.99.<br />
					In other suttas this stands for the place where the four great 'dhatū' [characteristics, attributes, elements] (earth, water, firelight, wind] meet.</p>
