In this Sutta we have discussed first the question of the ability to see heavenly sights and hear heavenly sounds where the Buddha says that it is not for the sake of acquiring such powers that people join the Order under him, then he gradually leads the questioner on to Arahatship, as the aim, along the Eightfold Path." />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time The Lucky Man,<br />
					around <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a> revisiting,<br />
					Great Woods, Peaked-roof-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time then<br />
					a great number of Kosalan Brahmān-envoys<br />
					and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys<br />
					were dwelling in Vesali<br />
					doing whatever they were supposed to be doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Kosalan Brahmān-envoys<br />
					and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A shaman indeed,<br />
					good Gotama,<br />
					Sakyan-son,<br />
					renunciate of the Sakyan clan<br />
					is revisiting Vesali,<br />
					the Great Woods,<br />
					Peaked-roof hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of that Lucky Man, Gotama,<br />
					good rumor has it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'This is without doubt The Lucky Man,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					consummately-self-awakened,<br />
					possessed of vision and conduct,<br />
					well-gone,<br />
					worldly-wise,<br />
					unsurpassed <i>Dhamma</i>-driving force of persons,<br />
					master of gods and men,<br />
					The Awake,<br />
					The Lucky Man.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>He, seeing with his own eyes<br />
					by his own higher-knowledge<br />
					this world with its gods,<br />
					with its Mara's,<br />
					with its Brahmās,<br />
					with its shaman and Brahmins,<br />
					gives the word<br />
					to this generation of gods and men.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>He declares <i>Dhamma:</i><br />
					at the start, helpful;<br />
					in the middle, helpful;<br />
					at the conclusion, helpful.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>It is well, indeed,<br />
					to get to see sucha sight —<br />
					an Arahant,<br />
					exemplifying perfect fulfillment<br />
					of the thoroughly purified Brahmā carriage.'</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Kosalan Brahmān-envoys<br />
					and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys approached Great Woods, Peaked-roof-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Ancient Nagito was the personal attendant of The Lucky Man so those Kosalan Brahmān-envoys and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys approached the Ancient Nagito.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached the Ancient Nagito, they said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where then, good Nagita,<br />
					might Gotama be at present residing?</p>

					<p class="f4">May we have the pleasure of seeing that Lucky Man?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is now untimely, friends, to see The Lucky Man —<br />
					in secluded chambers is The Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Kosalan Brahmān-envoys and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys just there took seats to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When we have had sight of that Lucky Man Gotama we will return home."</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis drew near Great Woods, Peaked-roof-hall and approached the Ancient Nagito.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached the Ancient Nagito, they gave salutation and stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side Otthaddho the Licchavi said this to the Ancient Nagito:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where then, good Nagita,<br />
					might The Lucky Man, Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened,<br />
					be at present residing?</p>

					<p class="f4">We would have the pleasure of seeing that Lucky Man, Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is now untimely, Mahāli, to see The Lucky Man —<br />
					in secluded chambers is The Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">Otthaddho the Licchavi just there took a seat to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seen ere I return home will be The Lucky Man, Arahant, Consummately-Self-Awakened."</p>

					<p class="f4">There then Siho the apprentice approached the Ancient Nagito and drew near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having drawn near, saluting the Ancient Nagita, he stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side, then, Siho the apprentice said this to the Ancient Nagita:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante Kassapa, these Kosalan Brahmān-envoys and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys have come here to see The Lucky Man —<br />
					Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis too has come here to see The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be well, Bhante Kassapa, that these people gain sucha sight."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then Siha,<br />
					just you announce them to the Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Bhante," Siha the apprentice then said in reply to the Ancient Nagita.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then approaching The Lucky Man,<br />
					having approached the Lucky Man and saluted,<br />
					he stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side then,<br />
					Siha the apprentice said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante, these Kosalan Brahmān-envoys and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys have come here to see The Lucky Man —<br />
					Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis too has come here to see The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be well, <i>Bhante,</i> that these people gain sight of the Lucky Man."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Siha, spread out a seat in the shade of the residence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then "Even so, Bhante" said Siha the Apprentice to The Lucky Man in reply<br />
					and he spread out a seat in the shade of the residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then The Lucky Man came out of his residence and took the seat prepared in the shade of the vihara.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then those Kosalan Brahmān-envoys and Magadhan Brahmān-envoys approached The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached The Lucky Man they conversed together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having conversed together, making friendly exchanges, they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Otthaddho the Licchavi together with a reverential retinue of Lacchavis too approached and conversed together with The Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached The Lucky Man they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then, Otthaddho the Licchavi said this to The Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Previously, <i>Bhante,</i> a few days ago, Sunakkhatto Licchavi-<i>putto</i> came by and approached.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached he said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'From the time Mahāli,<br />
					that I have been living apprenticed to The Lucky Man,<br />
					it is not fully three rains,<br />
					and seen are divine sights,<br />
					lovely things, pleasure-producing, tempting<br />
					but not yet heard are divine sounds,<br />
					lovely things, pleasure-producing, tempting.'</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Are there then, <i>Bhante,</i><br />
					divine sounds not heard by Sunakkhatto Licchavi<i>-putto</i><br />
					lovely things, pleasure-producing, tempting<br />
					or are there not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, Mahāli,<br />
					divine sounds not heard by Sunakkhatto Licchavi<i>-putto</i><br />
					lovely things, pleasure-producing, tempting<br />
					there are not not."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Resulting from what driving force,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> <i>Bhante,</i><br />

					<p class="f4">These, then, Mahāli, are just such excellent and superior things to drive the realization of which a <i>bhikkhu</i> carries our Brahmā Carriage."</p>

					<p class="f4">Mahāli then asks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is such, Mahāli,<br />

					<p class="f4">"What then, <i>Bhante,</i> is the way,<br />
					what is the path-following,<br />
					for personally experiencing such things?" Mahāli asks.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this very Aristocratic Eight-dimensional Way, that is:</p>

					<p class="f4">High view,<br />
					high principles,<br />
					high talk,<br />
					high works,<br />
					high lifestyle,<br />
					high self-control,<br />

					<p class="f4">This then Mahāli, is that way<br />

					<p class="f4">At one time Mahāli, I was residing in Kosambī, Ghosita's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There then two wanderers,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having approached, given salutation and exchanged polite conversation they took seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated to one side then these two wanderers said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'How then friend, good Gotama, is it<br />
					that which is life is that which is body<br />
					or is it<br />
					that which is life is one thing, that which is body is another?'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></i></p>

					<p class="f4">'As to this, friends,<br />
					listen up,<br />
					attend well with mind,<br />
					I will speak!' said I.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'Even So, friend!'</i></p>

					<p class="f4">these two wanderers replied to me and I then said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> Here, friends, a <i>Tathāgata</i> arises in the world, Arahant, consummately-self-awakened, possessed of vision and conduct, well-gone, worldly-wise, unsurpassed <i>Dhamma</i>-driving force of persons, master of gods and men, The Awake, The Lucky Man.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, seeing with his own eyes, by his own higher-knowledge, this world with its gods, with its Mara's, with its Brahmās, with its shaman and Brahmins, gives the word to this generation of gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">He declares <i>Dhamma:</i><br />
					at the start, helpful;<br />
					in the middle, helpful;<br />
					at the conclusion, helpful,<br />
					exemplifying perfect fulfillment of the thoroughly purified Brahmā carriage.</p>

					<p class="f4">A housefather or housefather's son or someone clan-born hears that <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">He, hearing that <i>Dhamma,</i> gains faith in the <i>Tathāgata.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">He, possessed of this gained faith, reflects to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>'Crowded, the household life,<br />
					a place of dust,<br />
					of the open air is going forth,<br />
					it is not easy living in a house<br />
					to reach fulfillment<br />
					to reach a purity of polish<br />
					like mother-of-pearl<br />
					in the carrying on of Brahmā's carrying on.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">How about I cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					don ocher rags, and<br />
					from home go forth<br />
					to homelessness!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He then, after a time<br />
					having let go of his small pile of wealth, or<br />
					having let go of his large pile of wealth;<br />
					having let go of his small circle of relations, or<br />
					having let go of his large circle of relations,<br />
					cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					dons ocher rags, and<br />
					from home goes forth<br />
					to homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So thus being one gone forth,<br />
					taking on the training of the beggar's life,<br />
					possessed of carriage and pasture<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					fearing sight even of any measure of fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">Undertaking the seeker's-path<br />
					he conducts himself with skill<br />
					in his acts of body, deed, and speech —</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure of livelihood,<br />
					of comprehensive ethical conduct,<br />
					guarded at the doors of the senses,<br />
					measured in the taking of nourishment,<br />
					recollected and self-aware,<br />
					possessed of contentment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friends, is a beggar of comprehensive ethical culture?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here a beggar lets go of the destruction of life,<br />
					abstains from the destruction of life,<br />
					puts down the stick,<br />
					puts down the sword,<br />
					and lives friendly and compassionate,<br />
					intent on empathy with all breathing beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so is his ethical conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of taking the ungiven,<br />

					<p class="f4">Letting go of un-Brahmā-like ways,<br />

					<p class="f4">Letting go of untrue speech,<br />
					truth-speeking,<br />
					truth-bearing,<br />
					steadfast,<br />

					no poisoner of the world,<br />
					he abstains from untrue speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of hateful speech,<br />

					he tells not here,<br />
					a disturbing thing heard here,<br />

					having enjoyment of peace,<br />

					whatever speech is gentle,<br />
					sweet to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					at home in the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					popular with the people,<br />
					pleasant to the people,<br />
					he speaks such words as those.</p>

					<p class="f4">Letting go of idle lip-flapping,<br />

					having speech worth treasuring,<br />
					spoken at the right time,<br />
					well-reasoned,<br />
					well-defined,<br />
					on the goal,<br />
					he is a timely-speaker,<br />
					a speaker on reality,<br />
					a speaker on the goal,<br />
					a speaker on <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					a speaker on the Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so is his ethical conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from damaging seeds and crops.</p>

					<p class="f4">He eats once a day and not at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from eating at improper times.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not watch dancing, singing, music and shows.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not accept gifts of women and young girls,<br />

					from wounding,<br />
					killing,<br />

					and taking food by force.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so is his ethical conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas some shamans and Brahmins,<br />

					<p class="ctr smc">Here Ends the Mahāli Sutta</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup><i>Ko nu kho Bhante hetu ko paccayo.</i> <i>'Hetu'</i> is 'driving force'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">PED states that it is from 'hi', to impel. 'Hi!' or 'Hi-ya!' 'Giddy-up'. This is the word at the lowest most timeless level. 'On account of what is the result that'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'Reason' and 'Cause' would do if heard as generally used in American English, but not if understood precisely. It isn't a 'cause' in the sense of making a thing happen or not happen. The driving force can crack the whip, but it can't make the horse drink.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is a, or the, primary or operant factor in the making of a thing happen. It is not a, or the, 'reason' because it is a force, not a static condition. The crack of the whip is the reason the horse gets moving, but that is not the <i>'hetu',</i> what impels it. What impels it to move, the driving force, the <i>hetu,</i> is the force of the fear of the touch of the whip.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is the force of Sunakkhatto Licchavi-putto's intent to see sights in a single direction that is preventing him from hearing sounds. He has an 'idea' in his methodology that is a force in operation against the outcome he, in another frame of mind, wants to achieve.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We would probably just say: 'Why doesn't he hear such sounds?" But if the question had been put to Gotama that way then the answer would likely have been: 'Because he is employing an incorrect method for the attaining of that result.' And to get to the details another question would need to be asked.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In translating <i>'hetu'</i> we need to imply 'driving-force' as in the driving force of a chariot, while avoiding the idea that that force is the single thing making a certain thing happen or not happen.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The phrase also could be rendered: What is the precursor driving force ... driving force ..., or<br />
					What is the requisite driving force ... driving force,</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Some will note I translate the term <i>Taṃ kissa hetu?</i> as 'How come?' ['What drives?'] This works for this phrase, but in the case under discussion it would need to be 'How comes the result (consequence, repercussion, requisite condition, condition) that' or 'how does it come about that the result is'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Ignoring the <i>'paccayo'</i> we could say: "How come?" but again in those days, with Gotama, that would likely have resulted in an unenlightening answer like: 'Because he used the wrong method.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The questioner wants to know how to practice to both hear the sounds and see the sights. Likely his retinue is a group of students and he is asking this question to dispel doubts and teach them the method.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We might say: 'How does it end up that?'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Pura-t-thimāya:</i> from <i>'pura'</i> fore, PED has 'eastern', facing East;<br />
					<i>disāya:</i> point, direction;<br />
					<i>dakkhiṇāya:</i> 'to the right', PED: #3. (of that point of the compass which is characterized through "orientation" by facing the rising sun, and then lies on one's right:) Southern;<br />
					<i>pacchimāya:</i> PED has lots of words like hindmost, hind-, back-, last, latest, lowest, meanest — Western;<br />
					versus:<br />
					<i>uttarāya:</i> higher, high, superior, upper over, beyond — Northern.<br />
					The list also frequently includes:<br />
					<i>uparimā</i> and <i>heṭṭhimā disā:</i> above and below; = as in this sutta: <i>uddham-adho + tiriyaṃ:</i> above, below, across
					the four <i>anudisā:</i> the four intermediate directions, South-East, South-West, North-West, and North-East; collectively named:<br />
					The <i>dasa disā:</i> the ten directions.<br />
					Unlike the sequence describing time which is always: 'past, future, present,' PED notes that the sequence for direction is not always consistent though I have never seen it not begin with the East. The flames from the Eastern wall rebound off the Western Wall, the flames from the Western Wall rebound off the Eastern wall. The Western current drives it East, the Eastern current drives it West. ...</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This section down to the end of this group and the similar sections in the next two groups are not included in either The PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> or Rhys David's translation, though apparently existing in Rhys Davids personal version of the <i>Pāḷi</i> of this sutta. BJT includes these paragraphs (with some differences that look to have resulted from 'copy and paste' errors.) Without straightening out the lines and paragraphs, seeing this in the original which is just one single run-in line, this is a massively confusing bit of text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The inclusion of these paragraphs delineates with a fine-grained precision the ideas under examination: "When this is done, that is the result; when he practices this way, he experiences that result; when a beggar practicing this way experiences that result, this is the driving force for that result; this is the driving force which results in this happening to Sunakkhatto Licchavi<i>-putto.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">This done in this way is a form of hypnotic suggestion which in this case because of its precision in following the exact sequence of thoughts the way they actually occur in the mind, would inspire great confidence in the ability of the speaker to be one who 'knows and sees'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Without this detail there is a discontinuity that would be disturbing: the question asked is why Sunakkhatto Licchavi<i>-putto</i> does not hear divine sounds, but we are given, as well as a response to that, the driving force resulting in hearing or not hearing divine sounds, seeing or not seeing divine sights, and both seeing divine sights and hearing divine sounds. The 'extra' details are needed to show that the answer is still really just to the original question and is not a digression.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">But what patience there must have been on both sides to go through this like this!<br />
					But what a reward for doing so!</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is another similar situation in the suttas where Anuruddha is perplexed as to why he is able to see 'the light' sometimes but not 'forms' and sometimes is able to see 'forms' but not 'the light'. The mechanism is similar, but in his case involving over anxiousness or disinterest with regard to the experience of the one or the other. Gotama in this sutta speaks of having had the same experience himself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Something else is likely to happen in the case as described here. A beggar practicing in one direction whether for the single experience of seeing sights or hearing sounds, or for the dual experience of seeing sights and hearing sounds, is going to find himself unable to do so in another direction. How come? Because his practice was in only one direction.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We can imagine this being spelled out fully for all ten directions. ... and ... why not? Let's throw in seeing the light and seeing forms, and hearing sounds near and far, man-made or other-worldly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Because experiencing such experiences is not the goal of the system, that's why not.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">To go as far as is provided in this sutta was done for the good reason that it is the only complete way to answer the question and for demonstration to Mahāli and his followers of the precision of the Awakened mind. To go further would be to mis-direct. We get a sense of this issue with Mahāli's follow-up question.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Sotāpanno.</i> Do you hear it? What? The sound of the Stream. I think the fact that this word means 'ear' as well as 'stream' cannot be lost on this audience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>A-vinipāta-dhammo niyato sambodhi-parāyaṇo.</i> No-destruction-thing destined self-awake-culmination<br />
					<i>Vinipāta</i> PED: ruin, destruction; a place of suffering, state of punishment;<br />
					<i>niyato</i> PED: restrained, bound to, constrained to, sure (as to the future), fixed (in its consequences), certain, assured, necessary;<br />
					<i>sambodhi</i> own- self-awake;
					<i>parāyaṇ</i> PED: going through to, ending in, aiming at, given to, attached to, having one's end or goal in; also: finding one's support in (as <i>daṇḍa</i>- leaning on a stick M I.88; A I.138), in following phrases prevalent: <i>Amata-</i> S V.217 sq.; <i>tama-</i> Pug 51; <i>Nibbāna-</i> S IV.373; V.218; <i>Brahmācariya-</i> S I.234; <i>Maccu-</i> S V.217; <i>sambodhi-;</i><br />
					Walsh: not liable to states of woe, firmly set on the path to enlightenment;<br />
					Rhys Davids: one who cannot be reborn in any state of woe, and is assured of attaining to the insight (of the stages higher still).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The meaning is that one has seen the error in [1] holding views as absolute truths, [2] trusting that good deeds, ethical behavior, rights, or rituals will bring one to the end of pain, and [3] doubt that the <i>Dhamma</i> will lead one who acts in accordance with it to the end of pain, and that Gotama realized Awakening.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is elsewhere described as having 'unshakable faith in the Buddha, <i>Dhamma</i> and <i>Saṅgha</i> [where <i>'Saṅgha'</i> is understood to mean those who have attained one or another or all of the four stages that begin with Stream-entry]'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The idea that this amounts to blind faith should be avoided (In later translations, the view, being unavoidable, has changed to admit that there are those with blind faith who may be Streamwinners): this is faith that has been founded on the real perception of the error of views, trust in good deeds, etc.! That, stated another way is the perception that: 'There is no own-made thing that having come to be does not come to an end.' This is often the only way the attainment of Stream-entry is described.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Tanuttā.</i> PED: diminution, reduction, vanishing, gradual disappearance. At/for this stage not total eradication.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Sakadāgāmī. Sakid:</i> once; <i>ā</i> to; <i>gāma:</i> home.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Orambhāgiyānaṃ.</i> The yokes binding one to the 'lower' worlds, not the lower yokes. The lower worlds are those also called the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#kamaLOKAS"><i>'kama loka'</i></a> 'pleasure worlds' and include worlds inhabited by beings in Hell, in Animal Bodies, in Ghostly forms, in Demonic Forms, the Human world, beings that reside with the Four Kings of the Four Directions, beings that reside with the Gods of the Chamber of the Three and Thirty (Sakka's Realm = Indra's Realm, probably = Zeus's Realm, Jupiter's Realm, God's Heaven), beings that reside in Yama's Paradise, beings that reside with The gods of the Heaven of Delight <i>(Tusita),</i> beings that reside with The Gods of Creation <i>(Nimmanarati),</i> and beings that reside with The Gods of Manipulation <i>(Para-nimmita-vasavatti).</i> All these are out for this guy, not, as with Rhys Davids, just 'this world'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">One might well ask how Hell, animal birth, ghostly birth and demonic birth could be considered 'pleasure worlds'. For one faced with the idea of annihilation at death, 'being' in any form is considered a pleasure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Opapātiko.</i> One who without experiencing a death here or birth there re-appears there 'reborn' as a youth fifteen years of age. Very much like the power to disappear from here and re-appear there except that in this case he is 'reborn', has entered a new 'life.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'There,' so I hear, being one of the Pure Abodes <i>(Suddhavasa)</i> and that he is a non-returner who realizes Arahantship during his lifetime there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The word used here is <i>anāvatti-dhammo</i> 'non-back-falling-' where <i>'dhamma'</i> apparently means 'of a nature' 'a thing that' and the statement is that he is not subject to falling from there. It is usually stated that he attains Arahantship half-way through the normal lifespan there. But since life in these abodes is exclusively for non-returners, all beings there would attain Arahantship half-way through the normal lifespan there so the normal lifespan there would be ... ? It is also stated that such a one has attained that place and has immediately become one to reach <i>Nibbāna.</i> So who knows. It may be that in these realms one reaches Arahantship half-way through the lifespan there and then lives as an Arahant for the remainder of that lifespan there. That would mean that there were thousands upon thousants of Arahants in these realms that could teach the way from actual experience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Parinibbāyī. Pari:</i> all-around; <i>nibbāyī:</i> unbound, released.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Āsavā.</i> The corrupting influence of sense pleasure, the corrupting influence of living, the corrupting influence of blindness and the corrupting influence of points of view. The last is sometimes not given and is essentially covered by the third. The eradication of the <i>āsavas</i> given at the end of this sutta is included by reference to the description of the process in DN 2 where it has only the three. I do not recall having seen the process as it is given in DN 2 where the four are used. The term is also used in a broad way to indicate things that might cause distraction such as a tree-stump in one's path, uneven ground, a mad dog, etc. It might be better to translate it as 'disrupting influence'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Here it is: <i>"Kin nu kho āvuso bho Gotama,||<br />
					taṃ jīvaṃ taṃ sarīraṃ udāhu aññaṃ jīvaṃ aññaṃ sarīran?" ti.</i><br />
					Literally: How then friend good Gotama, is it<br />
					'That-um life that-um body<br />
					or other-um life other-um body?' (end quote);<br />
					the direct question. I think this might be much clearer with the hand gestures that most likely accompanied the original question. Another more interesting hypothesis is that they were speaking with only basic knowledge of <i>Pāḷi</i> or even that this is a remnant of the <i>Pāḷi</i> that was in actual use. The fact that they address Gotama as 'friend' shows at least that they were unfamiliar with the etiquette of Gotama's <i>Saṅgha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Subsequently in the sutta it will be:<br />
					<i>'"Taṃ jīvaṃ, taṃ sarīran" ti vā<br />
					"Aññaṃ jīvaṃ, aññaṃ sarīran" ti vā' ti.</i><br />
					'Is it said: "That life is that body"<br />
					or is it said:<br />
					"Life is a separate thing, the body is a separate thing?"' (end quote.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This latter emphasizing that this is a proposition that there are only two points of view possible and that in this system neither proposition is acceptable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">As an aside it is useful to point out that this is a good example of why one needs to consult the <i>Pāḷi.</i> Just reading the translation it would be highly probable that one would assume that what was being spoken of here was 'self" <i>'atta'</i> and 'body' <i>'kaya'.</i> More often than not <i>'jiva'</i> would refer to 'life' or 'lifestyle' and <i>'kaya'</i> would be used as a broader term for what was understood to be the form of an individual as opposed to 'physical body' as here. These two wanderers have this body and its animating force in mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> From this point the text is abbreviated referencing §s 40-63; 64-75; 77-81; 83-96; and 97 of <i>Dīgha Nikāya,</i> Sutta II: <i>Samaññaphala-sutta,</i> changing only the conclusions of each section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>Ācāra-gocara-sampanno.</i> Literally to have come into carriage and cow-pasture. To be possessed of good manners and associations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Nihata-paccāmitto.</i> Neutralized-back-friends. These guys were often ruthless to the extreme going as far as to have all those executed who were near him in his ascent to the crown.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> This section is omitted in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and by Rhys Davids and would be omitted if following the indications of what was abbreviated and should be inserted back from DN 2 as indicated in the PTS <i>Pāḷi</i> and followed by the BJT — but it should be included as indicated in the summary: § 18 above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Sukha.</i> Sweetness. Sugar. Succor. Rhys Davids translation of this passage is especially beautiful:</p>

						<p class="f3 in4">'And gladness springs up within him<br />
						on his realizing that,<br />
						and joy arises to him thus gladdened,<br />
						and so rejoicing<br />
						all his frame becomes at ease,<br />
						and being thus at ease<br />
						he is filled with a sense of peace,<br />
						and in that peace his heart is stayed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Samādhiyati.</i> See above note, Rhys David's: 'stayed', presumably from the context, meaning settled down.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">PED: has: Passive of <i>samādahati = sam + adhiyati, adhiyati = a dahati</i><sup>1</sup> English: 'to do', to put down, set up; [but it can be 'to lite' 'to burn']: which would be something like "to have begun," "to have started," "to have set up" "to kindle".</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The issue is: is this a description of the first appearance of <i>samādhi,</i> serenity, or is this a description of the state where one has set up the conditions for <i>samādhi?</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Sammā Samādhi</i> is defined as the four <i>jhānas,</i> but <i>samādhi</i> is also a word for serene states other than the four <i>jhānas.</i> The translation here is saying that at this point a state of <i>samādhi</i> has been attained, that this is, in effect, a definition of <i>samādhi.</i> Walshe has 'concentrated,' meaning he has also taken this as 'one who has <i>samadhi'.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Note that this is not a description of ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is important to resolve for one who wishes to develop <i>Sammā Samādhi.</i> It is saying that one is, under these conditions, already in <i>samādhi,</i> has already become serene, prior to entering the first <i>jhāna.</i> We can then even return to the idea of <i>samādahati</i> understanding this state to have been the 'laying of the fire', the <i>jhānas</i> being the 'burning' itself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> This simile is one of the most perplexing passages in the suttas. That the connotation is sexual is beyond debate, but does this imply that the technique is similar to or identical with the sexual tantric method? Build up sexual sensations but do not bring it to the point of ... um ... oozing moisture? This is contradicted by every instruction concerning <i>'kama'</i> and even in the instructions concerning letting go of the involvements just preceding the first <i>jhāna.</i> That there are sexual references throughout the suttas cannot be denied, but in the other cases what is at work is a sort of mockery that relies on a phenomena discovered later by Freud wherein all human activity (especially note argument and contention) are subtle sublimations of the sexual drive. But in the case here the implication is to the nature of a practice and that is perplexing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The compromise suggested here is that 'in the same way' as a person arouses sexual excitement within himself by conjuring erotic images, here the <i>bhikkhu</i> arouses peaceful enthusiasm by conjuring with thinking and pondering recollections of his former bound up state as contrasted with his later freed state ... without yet allowing his enthusiasm to 'spill' out into utterances or activities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>Kalla.</i> PED: 1. well, healthy, sound ...  2. clever, able, dexterous ...  3. ready, prepared  ...  4. fit, proper, right S II.13 <i>(pañha)</i>. - nt. <i>kallaṃ</i> it is proper, befitting (with inf. or inf.-substitute): <i>vacanāya</i> proper to say.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I have used 'reasonable' as pointing more clearly to our ears than 'proper' to the intent I see in the passage, that is, that up to the last point it would be reasonable to ask such a question, but that he himself would not do so.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Walshe, Rhys Davids and the commentaries see this as an exchange between the two Wanderers and Gotama whereas I have it as a rhetorical question answered by himself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The <i>Pāḷi</i> has the response put both ways in various versions [see <a href="../../pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#n26">Rhys Davids, n. 26,27</a>]. Rhys Davids has it: 'yes it would be' to the end and 'no' for the last. Walshe changes the sequence throughout to 'not-reasonable'. Buddhaghosa has it as a dialog, not a rhetorical question, but indicates the same sequence of responses as I have used here with explanation that the hypothetical <i>bhikkhu</i> being used as the example by Gotama has got Arahantship at this point. This at least is evidence that the early <i>Pāḷi</i> was as here — saying it would be 'reasonable' up to the last but not in the last case.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Another thing: the Wanderers, when addressing Gotama are made in this story which is being spoken by Gotama, to address him as 'friend good Gotama' but here, where they are presumed to be speaking by Walshe, Rhys Davids and the commentary, only 'friend' is used. <i>Āvuso</i> can be 'friend' or 'friends'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I think it is a much more powerful statement when made as it appears in the <i>Pāḷi</i> and as I have rendered it here. ... it is 'reasonable' to ask, but it would be wiser to wait until one's knowing and seeing was that of the Arahant where it would no longer be reasonable to ask such a question because one sees that this is not relevant to leaving behind birth, living the Brahmā life, finishing one's duties, ending one's journey through the being of any sort of it at any place of atness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Nippītikena. Nis</i> = put down, <i>pīti</i> = enthusiasm + <i>ka.</i> By way of seeing that it is own-made, intentionally done and attached to the world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> The <i>Pāḷi</i> gives, in stead of the colors as I have it, the names of the varieties. "Overgrown with ~" <i>Uppaliniyaṃ vā paduminiyaṃ vā puṇḍarīkiniyaṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">PED states that "It is usually mentioned in two varieties, viz. <i>ratta-</i> and <i>seta-, i.e.</i> red and white lotus, so at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.5/jat.5.514.fran.pts.htm">J V.37</a>;"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Elsewhere the colors are apparently used to describe various purities of recluse, so I am assuming that the important thing here is that Gotama's audience is 'seeing' the overgrown pond and the colors, not determining variety — that this is a sort of hypnotic regression. ... as is the repetition and degree of 'soakings' and, indeed, the similes themselves are very powerful hypnotic images.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> See: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p5">DN 22 § 5</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>Cātum-mahā-bhūtiko.</i> As distinguished from <i>cātum-mahā-dhatū,</i> where no distinction is usually made by translators. When it is <i>bhūtika</i> it is a physical thing and element works well, when it is <i>dhatū</i> it is a characteristic and data works well.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>Abhi-nimmina-nāya.</i> To over-out-mete. To mete out. Measure out. Conjure up. Create with magic power.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Abhinimmināti</i> [<i>abhi + nimmināti,</i> cp. BSanskrit <i>abhinirmāti</i> ... ] to create (by magic), produce, shape, make<br />
					<i>Nimmināti</i> [cp. Sanskrit <i>nirmimīti</i> and <i>nirmāti, nis+mināti, mā;</i> cp. <i>nimināti</i>] to measure out, fashion, build, construct, form; make by miracle, create, compose; produce, lay out, plan.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">How does 'mete out', a 'measure' become creating a feat of 'conjuration'? Having relaxed the notion of self with regard to that <i>kaya</i> there, seeing it, for example, as simply a white splotch as in the fourth <i>jhāna,</i> one very carefully 'divides away' (in a process similar to, and maybe identical with mitosis) in measured amounts a bit at a time gradually bringing forth a separate entity complete in all its parts. Maybe. Or maybe this means to pull out,  withdraw.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Also <i>Abhi-nimmina-nāya.</i> See n. 25.</p>

					</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>Karaṇḍā.</i> Basket but also slough. Rhys Davids uses slough as have I in other translations of this simile, but it occurs to me that what is intended is the image of the snake charmer, drawing out his snake from its basket. I don't think it is often that it is a man that removes a snake from its slough. This needs to parallel the task of conjuring a mind-made body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> <i>Tiro-bhāvaṃ.</i> Become beyond or beyond becoming. Understanding <i>bhāva</i> as 'living' or 'being' as some sort of being in some place of being. As I hear how this works this is a relative power. Relative to the scope of the observer, so limited to the class of 'being' that he is observing. The person with this power is able to go out of this class of beings, beyond, into another and in that way becomes invisible in the original state. If the observer is also able to see beyond, he has not achieved this power relative to that observer.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>Ceto.</i> What we understand to be mental states. Here in this country at this time we do not much use the idea of 'heart' to describe the mind and we have no good term for the full scope of the objects of the heart. Emotions covers part, moods covers part, states of mind describes the phenomena that is going on in the heart but uses the wrong term in 'mind'. Mind needs to be understood in a larger context as encompassing all things mental from perception through emotions. Heart is bound up in the existence of the individual and it is that which is being encompassed here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">As pointed out in <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#EncompassingaHeart"><i>The <i>Pāḷi</i> Line:</i></a> we have here an example of a <i>Dhamma</i> used in one place for one purpose — in The <i>Satipaṭṭhana Sutta,</i> to set up knowledge, awareness, recollection of and release from mental states — the purpose of which is detachment, and the purpose of detachment clarity — and turning up in another place for another purpose — as the power of reading other's emotions and mental states. The training of the former is the training for the latter. The experience of the latter is the reason for the former.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>Singhāṭake.</i> It is not easy to see how this becomes 'square' or 'crossroads.' Apparently it evolves from <i>'saṇ' + Ghaṭeti</i> = own-connection, joining, uniting, or <i>'saṇ' + 'Ghaṭa'</i> = own crowd. Possibly gathering place becomes 'square'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">PED does not help, but has for:<br />
					<i>Ghaṭeti</i> [Denominitive from <i>ghaṭa</i><sup>2,</sup> cp. <i>gantheti</i>] to join, to connect, to unite J I.139; frequent in <i>anusandhiṃ ghaṭetvā</i> adding the connection (between one rebirth and another) J I.220, 308.<br />
					<i>Ghaṭ</i>a<sup>2</sup> (m. and f.) [Sanskrit <i>ghaṭā;</i> conn. with <i>ganthati</i> to bind together] multitude, heap, crowd, dense mass, <i>i.e.</i> thicket, cluster <i>itthi-</i> a crowd of women J IV.316; <i>maccha-</i> a swarm of fish J II.227; <i>vana-</i> dense forest J II.385; IV.56; V.502; VI.11, 519, 564; <i>Brahmā-</i> company of Brahmins J VI.99.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In other suttas this stands for the place where the four great <i>'dhatū'</i> [characteristics, attributes, elements] (earth, water, firelight, wind] meet.</p>
