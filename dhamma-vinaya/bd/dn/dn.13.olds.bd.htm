					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, the Lucky Man was journeying through Kosala<br />
					with a great company of beggars,<br />
					with about five hundred beggars,<br />
					and came to the Brahmān village in Kosala<br />
					which is called Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there at Manasākaṭa<br />
					the Lucky Man stayed in the mango grove,<br />
					on the bank of the river Akiravatī,<br />
					to the north of Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time<br />
					many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmāns<br />
					were staying at Manasākaṭa;<br />
					to wit,<br />
					Kaṅkī the Brahmān,<br />
					Tārukkha the Brahmān,<br />
					Pokkharasādi the Brahmān,<br />
					Jāṇussoṇi the Brahmān,<br />
					Todeyya the Brahmān,<br />
					and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmāns.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Now a conversation sprung up between Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja,<br />
					when they were taking exercise<br />
					and walking up and down,<br />
					in thoughtful mood,<br />
					as to which was the true path,<br />
					and which the false.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. The young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been pointed out<br />
					by the Brahmān Pokkharasādi."</p>

					<p class="f4">5. The young Brahmān Bhāradvāja said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been pointed out<br />
					by the Brahmān Tārukkha."</p>

					<p class="f4">6. But neither was the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha<br />
					able to convince the young Brahmān Bhāradvāja,<br />
					nor was the young Brahmān Bhāradvāja<br />
					able to convince the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Then the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha<br />
					said to the young Brahmān Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That <i>Samaṇa</i> Gotama, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					of the sons of the Sākyas,<br />
					who went out from the Sākya clan<br />
					to adopt the religious life,<br />
					is now staying at Manasākaṭa,<br />
					in the mango grove,<br />
					on the bank of the river Aciravatī,<br />
					to the north of Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now regarding that venerable Gotama,<br />
					such is the high reputation<br />
					that has been spread abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That Exalted One is an Arahat,<br />
					a fully enlightened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness,<br />
					happy,<br />
					with knowledge of the worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher of gods and men,<br />
					an Exalted One,<br />
					a Buddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, then, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					let us go to the place<br />
					where the <i>Samaṇa</i> Gotama is;<br />
					and when we have come there,<br />
					let us ask the <i>Samaṇa</i> Gotama<br />
					touching this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the <i>Samaṇa</i> Gotama shall declare,<br />
					that let us bear in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, my friend!"<br />
					said the young Brahmān Bhāradvāja, in assent,<br />
					to the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha<br />
					and the young Brahmān Bhāradvāja<br />
					went to the place<br />
					where the Lucky Man was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they had come there,<br />
					they exchanged with the Lucky Man<br />
					the greetings and compliments<br />
					of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while they were thus seated<br />
					the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha<br />
					said to the Lucky Man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As we, Gotama, were taking exercise<br />
					and walking up and down,<br />
					there sprung up a conversation between us<br />
					on which was the true path,<br />
					and which the false.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been pointed out<br />
					by the Brahmān Pokkharasādi.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhāradvāja said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been pointed out<br />
					by the Brahmān Tārukkha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Regarding this matter, Gotama,<br />
					there is a strife,<br />
					a dispute,<br />
					a difference of opinion between us."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. "So you say, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that you said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been pointed out<br />
					by the Brahmān Pokkharasādi.'</p>

					<p class="f4">While Bhāradvāja said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been pointed out<br />
					by the Brahmān Tārukkha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But what, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is the strife,<br />
					dispute,<br />
					difference of opinion between you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "It is concerning the true path<br />
					and the false, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Various Brahmāns, Gotama,<br />
					teach various paths.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Addhariyā Brahmāns,<br />
					the Tittiriyā Brahmāns,<br />
					the Chandokā Brahmāns<br />
					[the Chandavā Brahmāns],<br />
					the Bavharijā Brahmāns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are all those saving paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are they all paths<br />
					which will lead him who acts according to them,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Gotama, as<br />
					near a village or a town<br />
					there are many and various paths,<br />
					yet they all meet together in the village —<br />
					just in that way<br />
					are all the various paths<br />
					taught by various Brahmāns —<br />
					the Addhariyā Brahmāns,<br />
					the Tittiriyā Brahmāns,<br />
					the Chandokā Brahmāns<br />
					[the Chandavā Brahmāns],<br />
					the Bavharijā Brahmāns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are all these saving paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are they all paths<br />
					which will lead him who acts according to them,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā?"</p>

					<p class="f4">11. "Do you say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say so, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you really say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So I say, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">12. "But, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is there a single one<br />
					of the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas,<br />
					who has ever seen Brahmā face-to-face?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Or is there then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					a single one of the teachers<br />
					of the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Or is there then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					a single one of the pupils of the teachers<br />
					of the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Or is there then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					a single one of the Brahmāns<br />
					up to the seventh generation<br />
					who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">13. "Well then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					those ancient Rishis<br />
					of the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas,<br />
					the authors of the verses,<br />
					the utterers of the verses,<br />
					whose ancient form of words<br />
					so chanted, uttered, or composed,<br />
					the Brahmāns of to-day chant over again or repeat;<br />
					intoning or reciting<br />
					exactly as has been intoned or recited -<br />
					to wit, Aṭṭhaka,<br />
					Vāmaka,<br />
					Vāmadeva,<br />
					Vessāmitta,<br />
					Yamataggi,<br />
					Aṅgirasa,<br />
					Bhāradvāja,<br />
					Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					Kassapa,<br />
					and Bhagu —<br />
					did even they speak thus, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We know it,<br />
					we have seen it,<br />
					where Brahmā is<br />
					from where Brahmā is,<br />
					whether Brahmā is'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">14. "Then you say, Vāseṭṭha<br />
					that none of the Brahmāns,<br />
					or of their teachers,<br />
					or of their pupils,<br />
					even up to the seventh generation,<br />
					has ever seen Brahmā face-to-face.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that even the Rishis of old,<br />
					the authors and utterers of the verses,<br />
					of the ancient form of words<br />
					which the Brahmāns of to-day so carefully intone<br />
					and recite precisely as they have been handed down -<br />
					even they did not pretend to know<br />
					or to have seen<br />
					where<br />
					or from where<br />
					or whether Brahmā is.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					have, in fact, said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What we know not,<br />
					what we have not seen,<br />
					to a state of union with that<br />
					we can show the way,<br />
					and can say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />
					this is the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā!'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does it not follow,<br />
					this being so,<br />
					that the talk of the Brahmāns,<br />
					versed though they be in the Three Vedas,<br />
					turns out to be foolish talk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, Gotama,<br />
					that being, so,<br />
					it follows that the talk<br />
					of the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					is foolish talk!"</p>

					<p class="f4">15. "Truly, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					should be able to show the way<br />
					to a state of union<br />
					with that which they do not know,<br />

 						</div>

					<p class="f4">Just, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					as with a string of blind men<br />
					clinging one to the other,<br />
					neither does the foremost see,<br />
					nor does the middle one see,<br />
					nor does the hindmost see —<br />
					even so, Vāseṭṭha, is the talk<br />
					of the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					but blind talk:<br />
					the first sees not,<br />
					the middle one sees not,<br />
					nor can the latest see.</p>

					<p class="f4">The talk then<br />
					of these Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas<br />
					turns out to be ridiculous,<br />
					mere words,<br />
					a vain and empty thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">16. What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Can the Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas —<br />
					like other, ordinary, people —<br />
					see the Moon and the Sun<br />
					as they pray to,<br />
					and praise,<br />
					and worship them,<br />
					turning round with clasped hands<br />
					towards the place from where they rise<br />
					and where they set?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, Gotama, they can".</p>

					<p class="f4">17. "What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brahmāns versed in the Three Vedas,<br />
					who can very well —<br />
					like other, ordinary, people —<br />
					see the Moon and the Sun<br />
					as they pray to,<br />
					and praise,<br />
					and worship them,<br />
					turning round with clasped hands<br />
					to the place from where they rise<br />
					and where they set —<br />
					are those Brahmāns,<br />
					versed in the Three Vedas,<br />
					able to point out the way<br />
					to a state of union<br />

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">18. "So you say, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that the Brahmāns are not able to point out<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, Vāseṭṭha, as if a man should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">31. What do you think, Vāseṭṭha,<br />

					<p class="f4">"He is not, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">Can there, then,<br />

					<p class="f4">35. Then you say, too, Vāseṭṭha,<br />

					whilst Brahmā is free from anger and malice,<br />

					<p class="f4">36. "Well said, Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">That these Brahmāns versed in the Vedas<br />

					<p class="f4">So that thus then, Vāseṭṭha, the Brahmāns,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore is it<br />

					their threefold wisdom is called<br />

					<p class="f4">37. When he had thus spoken,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It has been told me, Gotama,<br />
					that the <i>Samaṇa</i> Gotama knows the way<br />
					to the state of union with Brahmā."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is not Manasākaṭa near to this spot,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manasākaṭa is near to,<br />
					is not far from here."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					suppose there were a man<br />
					born in Manasākaṭa,<br />
					and people should ask him,<br />
					who never till that time<br />
					had left Manasākaṭa,<br />
					which was the way to Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man,<br />
					born and brought up in Manasākaṭa,<br />
					be in any doubt or difficulty?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">If the man had been born<br />
					and brought up in Manasākaṭa,<br />
					every road that leads to Manasākaṭa<br />
					would be perfectly familiar to him."</p>

					<p class="f4">38. "That man, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					born and brought up at Manasākaṭa<br />
					might, if he were asked the way to Manasākaṭa,<br />
					fall into doubt and difficulty,<br />
					but to the <i>Tathāgata,</i><br />
					when asked touching the path<br />
					which leads to the world of Brahmā,<br />
					there can be neither doubt nor difficulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Brahmā, I know, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					the world of Brahmā,<br />
					and the path which leadeth unto it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yea, I know it<br />
					even as one who has entered the Brahmā-world,<br />
					and has been born within it!"</p>

					<p class="f4">39. When he had thus spoken,<br />
					Vāseṭṭha, the young Brahmān,<br />
					said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so has it been told me, Gotama,<br />
					even that the <i>Samaṇa</i> Gotama knows<br />
					the way to a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is well!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the venerable Gotama<br />
					be pleased to show us the way<br />
					to a state of union with Brahmā,<br />
					let the venerable Gotama<br />
					save the Brahmān race!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Listen then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					and give ear attentively,<br />
					and I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, Lord!"<br />
					said the young Brahmān Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					in assent, to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">40. Then the Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Know, Vāseṭṭha, that<br />
					(from time to time)<br />
					a <i>Tathāgata</i> is born into the world,<br />
					an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness,<br />
					happy,<br />
					with knowledge of the worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher of gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One,<br />
					a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself,<br />
					thoroughly understands,<br />
					and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face<br />
					this universe —<br />
					including the worlds above<br />
					with the gods,<br />
					the Māras,<br />
					and the Brahmās;<br />
					and the world below<br />
					with its <i>Samaṇas</i> and Brahmāns,<br />
					its princes and peoples; —<br />
					and he then makes his knowledge<br />
					known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					both in the letter<br />
					and in the spirit,<br />
					lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation:<br />
					he makes known the higher life,<br />
					in all its purity<br />
					and in all its perfectness.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or one of his children,<br />
					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the <i>Tathāgata</i>;<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the saffron robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the saffron robes,<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has thus become a recluse<br />
					he lives self-restrained by that restraint that should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight,<br />
					and he sees danger<br />
					in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure are his means of livelihood,<br />
					good is his conduct,<br />
					guarded the doors of his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he is altogether happy.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Vāseṭṭha, is his conduct good?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this, Vāseṭṭha, that the <i>bhikkhu,</i><br />
					putting away the killing of living things,<br />
					holds aloof from the destruction of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The cudgel and the sword he has laid aside,<br />
					and ashamed of roughness,<br />
					and full of mercy,<br />
					he dwells compassionate and kind<br />
					to all creatures that have life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the taking<br />
					of what has not been given,<br />
					he lives aloof from grasping<br />
					what is not his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes only what is given,<br />
					and expecting that gifts will come,<br />
					he passes his life in honesty<br />
					and purity of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away unchastity,<br />
					he is chaste.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof,<br />
					far off from the vulgar practice,<br />
					from the sexual act.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away lying words,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from falsehood.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks truth,<br />
					from the truth he never swerves;<br />
					faithful and trustworthy,<br />
					he breaks not his word to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away slander,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from calumny.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he hears here<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus does he live as a binder together<br />

					an encourager of those who are friends,<br />
					a peacemaker,<br />
					a lover of peace,<br />
					impassioned for peace,<br />
					a speaker of words that make for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away rudeness of speech,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from harsh language.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever word is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the car,<br />
					lovely,<br />
					reaching to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasing to the people,<br />
					beloved of the people -<br />
					such are words he speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away frivolous talk,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from vain conversation.</p>

					<p class="f4">In season he speaks,<br />
					in accordance with the facts,<br />
					words full of meaning,<br />
					on religion,<br />
					on the discipline of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks, and at the right time,<br />
					words worthy to be laid up in one's heart,<br />
					fitly illustrated,<br />
					clearly divided,<br />
					to the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof<br />
					from causing injury to seeds or plants.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					not eating at night,<br />
					refraining from food after hours<br />
					at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from being a spectator<br />
					at shows at fairs,<br />

					he keeps himself aware<br />
					of what he is doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is it, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that the <i>bhikkhu</i> becomes mindful and self-possessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Vāseṭṭha, is the <i>bhikkhu</i> content?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this matter, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					the <i>bhikkhu</i> is satisfied with sufficient robes<br />
					to protect his body,<br />
					with sufficient food<br />
					to keep his body going.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whithersoever he may go,<br />
					these he takes with him as he goes<br />
					- just as a bird with his wings, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					whethersoever he may fly,<br />
					carries his wings with him as he flies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is it, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that the <i>bhikkhu</i> becomes content.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, master of this so excellent body of moral precepts,<br />
					gifted with this so excellent self-restraint as to the senses,<br />
					endowed with this so excellent mindfulness and self-possession,<br />
					filled with this so excellent content,<br />
					he chooses some lonely spot<br />
					to rest at on his way<br />
					— in the woods,<br />
					at the foot of a tree,<br />
					on a hill side,<br />
					in a mountain glen,<br />
					in a rocky cave,<br />
					in a charnel place,<br />
					or on a heap of straw in the open field.</p>

					<p class="f4">And returning there<br />
					after his round for alms<br />
					he seats himself, when his meal is done,<br />
					cross-legged,<br />
					keeping his body erect,<br />
					and his mind alert, intent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the hankering after the world,<br />
					he remains with a heart that hankers not,<br />
					and purifies his mind of lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the corruption<br />
					of the wish to injure,<br />
					he remains with a heart free from ill temper,<br />
					and purifies his mind of malevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away torpor of heart and mind,<br />
					keeping his ideas alight,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he purifies his mind of weakness and of sloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away flurry and worry,<br />
					he remains free from fretfulness,<br />
					and with heart serene within,<br />
					he purifies himself of irritability<br />
					and vexation of spirit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away wavering,<br />
					he remains as one passed beyond perplexity;<br />
					and no longer in suspense as to what is good,<br />
					he purifies his mind of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					as when a man, after contracting a loan,<br />
					should set a business on foot,<br />
					and his business should succeed,<br />
					and he should not only be able<br />
					to pay off the old debt he had incurred,<br />
					but there should be a surplus over<br />
					to maintain a wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then would he realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I used to have to carry on my business<br />
					by getting into debt,<br />
					but it has gone so well with me<br />
					that I have paid off what I owed,<br />
					and have a surplus over<br />
					to maintain a wife.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					as if a man were a prey to disease,<br />
					in pain, and very ill,<br />
					and his food would not digest,<br />
					and there were no strength left in him;<br />
					and after a time<br />
					he were to recover from that disease,<br />
					and his food should digest,<br />
					and his strength come back to him;<br />
					then, when he realized his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					as if a man were bound in a prison house,<br />
					and after a time<br />
					he should be set free from his bonds,<br />
					safe and sound,<br />
					and without any confiscation of his goods;<br />
					when he realized his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					as if a man were a slave,<br />
					not his own master,<br />
					subject to another,<br />
					unable to go whether he would;<br />
					and after a time<br />
					he should be emancipated from that slavery,<br />
					become his own master,<br />
					not subject to others,<br />
					a free man,<br />
					free to go whether he would;<br />
					then, on realizing his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					as if a man, rich and prosperous,<br />
					were to find himself on a long road,<br />
					in a desert, where no food was,<br />
					but much danger;<br />
					and after a time<br />
					were to find himself out of the desert,<br />
					arrived safe,<br />
					on the borders of his village,<br />
					in security and peace;<br />
					then, on realizing his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, Vāseṭṭha, the bhikkhu,<br />
					so long as these five hindrances<br />
					are not put away within him<br />
					looks upon himself as in debt,<br />
					diseased,<br />
					in prison,<br />
					in slavery,<br />
					lost on a desert road.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when these five hindrances<br />
					have been put away within him,<br />
					he looks upon himself as freed from debt,<br />
					rid of disease,<br />
					out of jail,<br />
					a free man,<br />
					and secure.</p>

					<p class="f4">And gladness springs up within him<br />
					on his realizing that,<br />
					and joy arises to him thus gladdened,<br />
					and so rejoicing<br />
					all his frame becomes at ease,<br />
					and being thus at ease<br />
					he is filled with a sense of peace,<br />
					and in that peace his heart is stayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">76. And he lets his mind pervade<br />
					one quarter of the world<br />
					with thoughts of friendliness,<br />
					and so the second,<br />
					and so the third,<br />
					and so the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus the whole wide world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					and everywhere,<br />
					does he continue to pervade<br />
					with heart of friendliness,<br />
					far-reaching,<br />
					grown great,<br />
					and beyond measure.</p>

					<p class="f4">77. Just, Vāseṭṭha, as a mighty trumpeter<br />
					makes himself heard -<br />
					and that without difficulty -<br />
					in all the four directions;<br />
					even so<br />
					of all things that have shape or life,<br />
					there is not one<br />
					that he passes by<br />
					or leaves aside,<br />
					but regards them all<br />
					with mind set free,<br />
					and deep-felt friendliness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly this, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is the way to a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he lets his mind pervade<br />
					one quarter of the world<br />
					with thoughts of sympathy,<br />
					and so the second,<br />
					and so the third,<br />

					<p class="f4">80. What do you think, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					will the <i>bhikkhu</i> who lives thus<br />
					be in possession of women and of wealth,<br />
					or will he not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He will not, Gotama!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely he will, Gotama!'</p>

					<p class="f4">81. "Then you say, Vāseṭṭha,<br />

					<p class="f4">82. When he had thus spoken,<br />

					addressed the Blessed One,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, Lord,<br />

					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which is thrown down,<br />

					that which is hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br />
					so that those who have eyes<br />
					can see external forms; —<br />
					just even so, Lord,<br />
					has the truth been made known to us,<br />
					in many a figure,<br />
					by the Lucky Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we, even we,<br />
					betake ourselves, Lord,<br />
					to the Blessed One as our refuge,<br />
					to the Teachings,<br />
					and to the Brotherhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One accept us as disciples,<br />
					as true believers,<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					as long as life endures!"</p>
