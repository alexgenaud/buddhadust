					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>X-saṅkappā, X-saññā X-dhātu.</i> I think in this set of six sets of terms we are being given a look-see into a very deep and not at all usual way of seeing the world. Starting with perceptions, our ordinary way is to think of ourselves as passive recipients of perception. Ordinarily we think of skill with regard to perception as "one has accurate or inaccurate perceptions and the more accurate the more skillful." But here we are being asked to understand that to have a perception of a certain nature is either skillful or unskillful. In other words, we are being told that perception is a matter of intent.<br />
					There is the case (see: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/powers_ofthe_aristocrats.htm">The Powers of the Aristocrats</a>) where perception is a matter of will: "... he is able to wish: 'let me perceive the ugly in the beautiful, the beautiful in the ugly, etc." And this would also fit in with the understanding of the transmutation of <i>vedana</i> depending on one's mental set with regard to being a part of the world (see discussion at <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/feelings.htm">dhamma_talk/feelings.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Then, if perception is a matter of will or intent, it is not too difficult to see that there must be available to the perceiver at the outset both skillful and unskillful characteristics from which to choose, so that is covered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">From there we can understand that <i>sankappas</i> (my "principles" others "aims" or more broadly, our intents, priorities and purposes based on our point of view) direct the mind towards skillful or unskillful characteristics which when contacted by sense-organ will produce skillful or unskillful perceptions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">One more thing to factor in: The giving up characteristic / principle / perception. Given that perception is based on characteristics, characteristics are necessarily finite. The finite exists within the infinite and therefore there would need to be a characteristic which represented the interface (or it would be like one was either locked onto the infinite or the finite and could not escape ... there needs to be an characteristic that allows for detachment ... I imagine a set of wires connected to a bomb; one can choose wires that produce a friendly explosion or ones that choose an unfriendly explosion, or the one that defuses the bomb.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The danger here is clear: one must at all costs avoid the conclusion that because one is able to direct perception and that consequently one's world is clearly of one's own making, that one therefore has a self somewhere in either the creative forces or the results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Well, I don't know about you, but this seems altogether a hugely revolutionary set of notions. I am reasonably sure there is nothing similar in Western psychology, and I don't think this idea appears in western philosophy. This should be world-shaking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> (<i>kāma, rūpa, arūpa</i>) Walshe and Rhys Davids, probably following commentary, take these to be "realms" or "loka" with Rhys Davids even making out <i>rūpa</i> to be the Brahmā world and <i>a-rūpa</i> to be the higher heavens <i>(a-rūpa-lokas).</i> My position is that we should stick to what we find in the text and make the commentary fit if possible, which would allow for us to say that the Brahmā world was <i>rūpa</i>-characteristic in nature but would allow for the idea that there were things other than the Brahmā world which could be classed as of the <i>rūpa</i>-characteristic ... etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> (<i>hīnā, majjhimā, paṇītā</i>) Walshe has: low, middling, sublime; Rhys Davids has: low, medium, sublime.<br />
					<i>hīnaṇ dhātuṇ paṭicca uppajjati hīnā saññā hīna</i>-characteristic rebound bound-up-in <i>hīna</i> perception. <i>Hīnayana</i> = the lesser vehicle. <i>Hīna jati</i> in formula for arahant, left behind is rebirth, or no more rebirth. Be-hind, hinder, rear, back, posterior.<br />
					PED: <i>hīna:</i> inferior, low; poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible, despicable<br />
					<i>paṇīta</i> PED: 1. brought out or to, applied, executed; 2. brought out or forth (made) high, raised, exalted, lofty, excellent; with reference to food (very often used in this sense) "heaped up, plentiful, abundant." opp: <i>hīna.</i> Fore- front</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>(Vibhava):</i> since <i>"vi"</i> can mean "re-" "un-" "di-" "bi-" "dis-", in some contexts "<i>vibhava</i>" is an indication of increase, (PED: 1. <i>vibhava:</i> power, wealth, prosperity) it is not absolutely certain that un-becoming, or ending or escape from living is the only real meaning intended in this context. In places where I have not claimed to be attempting a pure translation, I have used for the three thirsts: pleasure, living, more-living, re-living, and un-living. Not good translating, but acceptable <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Nirodha:</i> While not conclusive evidence that <i>vibhava</i> should be understood as re-living or more-living, this is suggestive.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Saṇyojanāni.</i> <i>san</i> = one's own; <i>yoja</i> = yoke; <i>ja</i> = birth; <i>a</i> = to; <i>ni</i> = down.

					These are the things that "downbind" the individual to renewed birth, and it is the elimination of sets of these that define the stages in progress in the <i>Pāḷi</i> system.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first three (<i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi, vicikicchā, sīlabbata-parāmāso</i>) when broken are the mark of stream-entry.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Walshe has: personality-belief, doubt, attachment to rite and ritual; Rhys Davids: false opinion concerning individuality, doubt, inverted (judgment) as to rule and ritual, and notes: See Expositor i, 65. B.'s note on the first runs: belief in the actual existence of a <i>kaya</i> consisting in body and mind — <i>i.e.,</i> of a soul (<i>atta</i>) in either of them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Being fettered to or yoked to one view of the self (<i>sa</i> = one &gt; <i>san</i> = own; <i>kaya</i> = body) (and by extension of "the world") along with the holding that any other way of viewing the self is incorrect.

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Vicikiccha,</i> doubt, vacilation; but specifically in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> concerning <i>kamma</i> and the ability to escape <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Where the translation for <i>silabbataparamaso</i> is usually given as belief in rites and rituals, I think this goes much further than that. <i>Sīla</i> is ethical culture; <i>sīlabbata</i> is good works and ceremonial observances (so much richer than either rites or rituals); (<i>paramasa</i> is being attached to, in the sense of being under the influence of). It is holding on to the belief that these things, which can be good things in isolation, accomplish the liberation of the individual form <i>samsara.</i> They do not; they make good <i>kamma</i> or they are useless.</p>

Note the order. Throughout the suttas this order is preserved. I suggest this is reflects the idea implicit in the <i>paticca samuppada</i> that the tendency of the mind is to keep on rolling in the direction it is set rolling and here one does not pursue the past or yearn for the future, but seeks liberation from the present. In addition, in the state of timelessness (<i>akalika</i>) which is attained by the Arahant or momentarily by others, Time as we know it does not exist. As you can imagine, this can lead to problems for one who has attained the state momentarily. Should they mistake their location and panic, this could lead to some unpleasant results. So this method of orientation is given, which, while describing Time on one level, describes situation on another.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is an obscure category, for sure. If it were not for "ending of own body" as the third, "ending" would seem to be the interpretation closest to what we are used to expect from the suttas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Walshe sees this as the ending of the three views ("ending of personality (view)" etc., not as a reference to the ending of personality).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Rhys Davids notes: 1. <i>sakkayo:</i> the five aggregates (body and mind) of grasping' comy; and 2. The discontinuance, extinction (<i>nibbāna</i>) of both.' comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">As I hear it, it is something like the way we set up resistance to ideas, so that the overall idea is that there are those that resist the idea of own body, there are those that resist the idea of the arising of own body, and there are those that resist the idea of the ending (extinction) of own body. The importance to Buddhists is that all three require point of view and that therefore resistance indicates (is a sign of) holding on to a view and should be got rid of. We do not hold the idea of "own body" or "personality", but we do not hold the idea of "there is no own body," etc.</p>

In the five factors of individuality (body and mind) <i>khandhā</i> are explained as meaning <i>rāsā.</i><br />
					<i>Micchatta-niyato rāsī</i> [<i>miccha</i> = low, bad, contrary, opposite, opposed, opposite <i>sammā</i>] a wrong thing, in the <i>Pāḷi,</i> a state opposing any of the eight/ten "folds" of the <i>Magga;</i><br />
					<i>niyata</i> PED: restrained, bound to, constrained to, sure (as to the future), fixed (in its consequences), certain, assured, necessary; <i>sammatta-niyato rāsī</i> high, consummate, best (again, of the eight/ten <i>anghas</i> of the <i>Magga;</i><br />
					<i>aniyato rāsī</i> not settled, uncertain, doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In the discussion groups on the web the term "accumulations" is thrown around very liberally, connected with all sorts of <i>kamma,</i> and with the implication that the predominant mode of <i>kamma</i> is the fixed sort.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I think a very good case can be made that below the extra-ordinary level most deeds fall into the uncertain-outcome pile.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The factor determining outcome of a deed in terms of experience is the intent with which the deed is performed. There are deeds which are of such high profile that it would be impossible to perform them with mixed intent. Of this sort, what we have in the literature is one or two extraordinary deeds described as fixed in outcome: the murder of one's parents or of an arahant, the drawing of the blood of a <i>Tathāgata</i> with intent to injure, creating a schism in the <i>Saṅgha;</i> some extraordinary good deed done for the Buddha. For the rest it is just about as impossible to perform deeds <i>without</i> mixed intent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">For a deed performed with mixed intent the outcome is determined by the point of view held at the time of fruition (or earlier in the case of one able to recall deeds done long ago). The 'repayment' or 'balancing' of accounts is accomplished for deeds by experience of the sensations created in the original act. These sensations can be experienced over a lengthy period of time or instantaneously and subjectively valued as 'bad' or 'good' depending on the point of view held with regard to them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">For example the experience of worry and anxiety connected with loss of wealth can be experienced as pleasant if the point of view taken is that this is a lesson in the perils of possession and the advantages of letting go and that the sensations are those of the ending of grasping after wealth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is the lesson taught in the section of the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> connected with sensation where sensation is described as being of three sorts [painful, pleasant, and not-painful-but-not-pleasant] and of two modes [downbound to the world and not downbound to the world].</p>

He instances the conduct of Sāriputta in the <i>'Catuma Sutta,'</i> M.I, 459, explaining the latter's motive." (See <i>Majjhima</i> #67: PTS, MLS II:#67, pp:128; WP: pp560, which does not deal with the same situation). The point here is that some, having done a deed in the past, or being in the habit of doing such deeds in the present, feel the need to keep this behavior secret, and their close followers, who may be aware of the behavior, keep quiet about it to others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We have the recent example of the guru who claimed never to eat who was addicted to McDonald's hamburgers, whose secret eating habits were kept from exposure by his close followers. There is also the case of the Catholic Church hiding the child molesting behavior of some priests.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">What is being spoken of here is a freedom from feeling the need to guard against exposure, not freedom from possible exposure or criticism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Even the Buddhas face criticism: "They will criticize you when you do right and they will criticize you when you do wrong, and they will criticize you when you do nothing ..."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Certainly today there are those who would criticize and call immoral the Buddha's behavior in leaving his wife and child prior to becoming a <i>Tathāgata</i> (today [7/16/2002], in the USA, he could be subjected to fines and jailed for this!).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">While this freedom from feeling the need to guard is a natural consequence and attribute of Arahantship (because the Arahant has given up any ambitions with regard to the world), it could be the attribute of anyone who gave up the idea of acting on fear of exposure due to the need for wrongly earned fame or a false good reputation. — Having one's past bad or questionable behavior be exposed publicly could certainly be embarrassing, but knowledge of the possibility of embarrassment does not necessarily dictate any attempt to hide such or guard against exposure. (What it may do is make one a tad shy of fame, but short of Arahantship, this is not such a bad fear to have (see: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.olds.bd.htm">Fame, Favors and Gains</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The difference is that the <i>Tathāgata</i> (and I say this includes the Arahant) has no need to give this any thought.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I am becoming more and more convinced that in terms of the way we use the terms <i>"kamma"</i> and <i>"sankhara"</i> today (7/19/02) there is very little difference between the two. If there is a difference it is non Buddhist (that is that <i>"kamma"</i> could mean <i>karma</i> in a general, non-individualized sense, where <i>saṅkāra</i> would mean one's own <i>karma</i> — both mean both the act <i>and</i> its consequences. In the <i>Pāḷi</i>, there is some slight emphasis on the act when <i>"kamma"</i> is used and some slight emphasis on the outcome when <i>"saṅkhāra"</i> is used. There is, in addition, a strong sense of "Identification with" associated with <i>"saṅkhāra."</i> To my mind <i>"saṅkhāra"</i> could well have been a word intended to clarify the idea that <i>kamma</i> was not just simply "action" but also the consequences thereof to an identified-with individuality, that is, that the results are Indentified-with. [This footnote is early (this sutta was one of the first I attempted) and in later translations this notion became a certainty that this term stood for the idea that the kamma involved is the intent to create personal experience through acts of body, speech and thought, that is, "own-making".</p>

Rhys Davids has "bases by merit accomplished" meaning that one has created a basis for some unstated thing based on doing something meritorious; Walshe has "grounds based on merit" meaning the same thing as Rhys Davids. Since the statement is: X: y-X; that would really result (meaning that their translations fudge the second half of the equation) for these translators in the statement: "Bases by merit accomplished: that of (composed of) giving based merit accomplished (<i>i.e.,</i> merit accomplished by giving, not a basis created by the merit of giving), which gives a different meaning for each half of the statement.

Being forced into this analysis of detail there is far greater likelihood that the real meaning will be revealed/preserved).</p>

					And he footnotes the last: <i>Buddh. Psych. Eth. 86; VM. 491; Asl. 291; B.</i> 'The faculty of the <i><i>aññātāvin</i></i> the holder of things known), of him who, in the philosophy of the Four Truths, has completed what was to be done.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Anaññātaṃ-ñassāmīt-indriyaṃ:</i> PED: the faculty of him (who believes) "I shall know what is not known (yet)." The "not-known-knowing-controlling power."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Aññ'indriyaṃ:</i> PED has the faculty of perfect knowledge or of knowledge made perfect; <i>aññā</i> is a synonym for arahantship, and is the power to know whatever one wishes to know whenever one wishes to know it; a slightly different understanding of the idea of omniscience (knowing all things at all times).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Aññātāvindriyaṃ:</i> PED: known, recognized.<br />
					If these three are a "method," then they need to show progression as well as indicate technique. In my rendering I am suggesting they are forces that can be employed by the holder: the intent to know; the inspiration of the knowable itself; the reward of knowing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> (<i>Cakkhūni: maṃsa, dibba, paññā</i>)<br />
					<i>maṃsa:</i> PED: [Vedic <i>māṃsa,</i> from Indogermanic <i>*memsro-,</i> Greek <i>μηρὁς,</i> thigh, Latin <i>membrum</i> limb ("member"); Gothic <i>mims</i> flesh; Old Irish <i>mīr</i> bite, bit (of flesh)] flesh, meat ... Described and defined in detail as one of the thirty-two <i>ākāras</i> or constituents of the human body at Vism 252, 354.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Interesting to note that PED has <i>Vī-maṃsā</i> derived from <i>vimansati</i> and that from <i>man</i> (mind) and defines it as consideration, examination, testing, investigation. I hear the (<i>aṃ</i> sound and get to <i>vimansati</i> from <i>vi + maṃsa + sati</i> or bring memory (or recollected sights) to mind, and say <i>vimaṃsa</i> is "re-member". This is the fourth of the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#The4PowerPaths">Four Iddhi-paddas,</a> and in the <i>Pāḷi</i> the progression, when there are series, is almost always from the simple to the advanced and "thinking" or investigating is, at best a beginner's technique in the development of magic powers, it certainly is not more advanced than formulating the intent, developing the heart, or developing energy, whereas use of the memory is.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The real difference in interpretation here is with <i>apāya.</i> Both Rhys Davids and Walshe hear this as associated with the <i>Apaya</i> realm. Neither seem to hear a reverberation to skill in entry and exit from the <i>jhānas</i> which is surprising. Here is another case where it would be ... um ... skillful to keep in mind that the <i>Dhamma</i> must always be made to be helpful to those at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end, which would dictate a more generic interpretation: whatever <i>āya</i> (<i>ā</i> = to, <i>ya</i> = whatever; PED has <i>ā + ya</i> = <i>i</i> = go, and also <i>aya</i> = income, inlet) is, then <i>ap-āya (<i>apa = ap</i> = from)</i> is its reverse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> (<i>Madā: ārogya-, yobbana-, jāvita-</i>): PED, Walshe, and Rhys Davids all use intoxications, which is a better sounding word here and which conveys the meaning better than "madness" because it shows the root better.</p>

					There is a book of commentary called the <i>Katha-vatthu:</i> Points of Controversy, tr. S.Z. Aung and Mrs C.A.F. Rhys Davids, 1915, 1993, (where it is clear that 'controversy' is what that book is dealing with).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is another case of the commentators confiscating for the service of their own ends concepts which are more broadly applicable. The godly habitations are attained by the <i>jhānas,</i> but they also include realms attained by simple good deeds; The Brahmā abodes are attained by the Four Godly Thoughts <i>(Brahmā-viharas)</i> but also by way of the <i>jhānas</i> and excellence of conduct and good deeds; as for the "ariyan abodes" the greater likelihood is that this is a reference to the Pure Abodes, the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#SUDDHAVASARealms"><i>Suddhavassa</i> Realms.</a> I do not recall anywhere in the suttas where it is stated that the Arahants "live" in any sort of <i>"vihara",</i> or <i>loka</i> or "abode." Additionally, when an individual attains one or another of the <i>jhānas,</i> he is often said to make it his <i>vihara,</i> but this phrase is not used when we hear of someone who has become arahant. This may, in fact simply be a reference to anyone who is on the path.</p>
