					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>X-saŋkappā, X-saññā X-dhātu.</i> I think in this set of six sets of terms we are being given a look-see into a very deep and not at all usual way of seeing the world. Starting with perceptions, our ordinary way is to think of ourselves as passive recipients of perception. Ordinarily we think of skill with regard to perception as "one has accurate or inaccurate perceptions and the more accurate the more skillful." But here we are being asked to understand that to have a perception of a certain nature is either skillful or unskillful. In other words, we are being told that perception is a matter of intent.<br />
					There is the case (see: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/powers_ofthe_aristocrats.htm">The Powers of the Aristocrats</a>) where perception is a matter of will: "...he is able to wish: 'let me perceive the ugly in the beautiful, the beautiful in the ugly, etc." And this would also fit in with the understanding of the transmutation of vedana depending on one's mental set with regard to being a part of the world (see discussion at <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/feelings.htm">dhamma_talk/feelings</a>.<br />
					Then, if perception is a matter of will or intent, it is not too difficult to see that there must be available to the perceiver at the outset both skillful and unskillful elements from which to choose, so that is covered.<br />
					From there we can understand that sankappas (my "principles" others "aims" or more broadly, our intents, priorities and purposes based on our point of view) direct the mind towards skillful or unskillful elements which when contacted by sense-organ will produce skillful or unskillful perceptions.<br />
					One more thing to factor in: The giving up element / principle / perception. Given that perception is based on elements, elements are necessarily finite. The finite exists within the infinite and therefore there would need to be an element which represented the interface (or it would be like one was either locked onto the infinite or the finite and could not escape...there needs to be an element that allows for detachment...I imagine a set of wires connected to a bomb; one can choose wires that produce a friendly explosion or ones that choose an unfriendly explosion, or the one that defuses the bomb.)<br />
					The danger here is clear: one must at all costs avoid the conclusion that because one is able to direct perception and that consequently one's world is clearly of one's own making, that one therefore has a self somewhere in either the creative forces or the results.<br />
					Well, I don't know about you, but this seems altogether a hugely revolutionary set of notions. I am reasonably sure there is nothing similar in Western psychology, and I don't think this idea appears in western philosophy. This should be world-shaking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> (<i>kāma, rūpa, arūpa</i>) Walshe and Rhys Davids, probably following commentary, take these to be "realms" or "loka" with Rhys Davids even making out rupa to be the Brahma world and arupa to be the higher heavens (arupa-lokas). My position is that we should stick to what we find in the text and make the commentary fit if possible, which would allow for us to say that the Brahma world was rupa-element in nature but would allow for the idea that there were things other than the Brahma world which could be classed as of the rupa-element...etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> (<i>hīnā, majjhimā, paṇītā</i>) Walshe has: low, middling, sublime; Rhys Davids has: low, medium, sublime.<br />
					<i>hīnaŋ dhātuŋ paṭicca uppajjati hīnā saññā</i> hina-element rebound bound-up-in hina perception. Hinayana = the lesser vehicle. Hina jati in formula for arahant, left behind is rebirth, or no more rebirth. Be-hind, hinder, rear, back, posterior.<br />
					PED: <i>hina</i>: inferior, low; poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible, despicable<br />
					<i>paṇīta</i> PED: 1. brought out or to, applied, executed; 2. brought out or forth (made) high, raised, exalted, lofty, excellent; with reference to food (very often used in this sense) "heaped up, plentiful, abundant." opp: <i>hina</i>. Fore- front</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> (<i>vibhava</i>): since "vi" can mean "re-" "un-" "di-" "bi-" "dis-", and in some contexts "<i>vibhava</i>" is an indication of increase, (PED: 1. vibhava: power, wealth, prosperity) it is not absolutely certain that un-becoming, or ending or escape from living is the only real meaning intended in this context. In places where I have not claimed to be attempting a pure translation, I have used for the three thirsts: pleasure, living, more-living, re-living, and un-living. Not good translating, but acceptable Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Nirodha:</i> While not conclusive evidence that <i>vibhava</i> should be understood as re-living or more-living, this is suggestive.</p>

					These are the things that "downbind" the individual to renewed birth, and it is the elimination of sets of these that define the stages in progress in the Pali system.<br />
					The first three (<i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi, vicikicchā, sīlabbata-parāmāso</i>) when broken are the mark of stream-entry.<br />
					Walshe has: personality-belief, doubt, attachment to rite and ritual; Rhys Davids: false opinion cerning individuality, doubt, inverted (judgment) as to rule and ritual, and notes: See Expositor i, 65. B.'s note on the first runs: belief in the actual existence of a <i>kaya</i> consisting in body and mind — i.e., of a soul (<i>atta</i>) in either of them.<br />
					PED on <i>sakkaya-ditthi</i>: theory of soul, heresy of individuality, speculation as to the eternity or otherwise of one's own individuality.<br />
					Being fettered to or yoked to one view of the self (sa=one &gt;san=own; kaya=body) (and by extension of "the world") along with the holding that any other way of viewing the self is incorrect. See <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/ditthi.htm">Glossology:Ditthi.</a><br />
					<i>Vicikiccha</i>, doubt, vacilation; but specifically in the Pali, concerning <i>kamma</i> and the ability to escape <i>kamma</i><br />
					Where the translation for <i>silabbataparamaso</i> is usually given as belief in rites and rituals, I think this goes much further than that. Sila is ethical culture; <i>silabbata</i> is good works and ceremonial observances (so much richer than either rites or rituals); (<i>paramasa</i> is being attached to, in the sense of being under the influence of). It is holding on to the belief that these things, which can be good things in isolation, accomplish the liberation of the individual form <i>samsara</i>. They do not; they make good <i>kamma</i> or they are useless.</p>

Note the order. Throughtout the suttas this order is preserved. I suggest this is reflects the idea implicit in the <i>paticca samuppada</i> that the tendancy of the mind is to keep on rolling in the direction it is set rolling and here one does not persue the past or yearn for the future, but seeks liberation from the present. In addition, in the state of Timelessness (<i>Akalika</i>) which is attained by the Arahant or momentarily by others, Time as we know it does not exist. As you can imagine, this can lead to problems for one who has attained the state momentarily. Should they mistake their location and panic, this could lead to some unpleasant results. So this method of orientation is given, which, while describing Time on one level, describes situation on another.</p>

					This is an obscure category, for sure. If it were not for "ending of own body" as the third, "ending" would seem to be the interpretation closest to what we are used to expect from the suttas.<br />
					Walshe sees this as the ending of the three views ("ending of personality (view)" etc., not as a reference to the ending of personality).<br />
					Rhys Davids notes: 1. <i>sakkayo</i>: the five aggregates (body and mind) of grasping' comy; and 2. The discontinuance, extinction (<i>nibbāna</i>) of both.' comy.<br />
					As I hear it, it is something like the way we set up resistance to ideas, so that the overall idea is that there are those that resist the idea of own body, there are those that resist the idea of the arising of own body, and there are those that resist the idea of the ending (extinction) of own body. The importance to Buddhists is that all three require point of view and that therefore resistance indicates (is a sign of) holding on to a view and should be got rid of. We do not hold the idea of "own body" or "personality", but we do not hold the idea of "there is no own body," etc.</p>

In the 5 factors of individuality (body and mind) <i>khandhā</i> are explained as meaning <i>raasā</i>.<br />
					<i>micchatta-niyato rāsī</i>[miccha=low, bad, contrary, opposite, opposed, opposite <i>sammā</i>] a wrong thing, in the Pali, a state opposing any of the 8/10 "folds" of the Magga; <i>niyata</i> PED: restrained, bound to, constrained to, sure (as to the future), fixed (in its consequences), certain, assured, necessary; <i>sammatta-niyato rāsī</i> high, consummate, best (again, of the 8/10 anghas of the Magga; <i>aniyato rāsī</i> not settled, uncertain, doubtful<br />
					In the discussion groups on the web the term "accumulations" is thrown around very liberally, connected with all sorts of <i>kamma</i>, and with the implication that the predominant mode of <i>kamma</i> is the fixed sort.<br />
					I think a very good case can be made that below the extra-ordinary level most deeds fall into the uncertain-outcome pile.<br />
					The factor determining outcome of a deed in terms of experience is the intent with which the deed is performed. There are deeds which are of such high profile that it would be impossible to perform them with mixed intent. Of this sort, what we have in the literature is one or two extraordinary deeds described as fixed in outcome: the murder of one's parents or of an arahant, the drawing of the blood of a Tathāgata with intent to injure, creating a schism in the Saŋgha; some extraordinary good deed done for the Buddha. For the rest it is just about as impossible to perform deeds <i>without</i> mixed intent.<br />
					For a deed performed with mixed intent the outcome is determined by the point of view held at the time of fruitition (or earlier in the case of one able to recall deeds done long ago). The 'repayment' or 'balancing' of accounts is accomplished for deeds by experience of the sensations created in the original act. These sensations can be experienced over a lengthy period of time or instantaneously and subjectively valued as 'bad' or 'good' depending on the point of view held with regard to them.<br />
					For example the experience of worry and anxiety connected with loss of wealth can be experienced as pleasant if the point of view taken is that this is a lesson in the perils of possession and the advantages of letting go and that the sensations are those of the ending of grasping after wealth.<br />
					This is the lesson taught in the section of the Satipatthana connected with sensation where sensation is described as being of three sorts [painful, pleasant, and not-painful-but-not-pleasant] and of two modes [downbound to the world and not downbound to the world].</p>

He instances the conduct of Sāriputta in the 'Catumasutta,' M.I, 459, explaining the latter's motive." (See Majjhima #67: PTS, MLS II:#67, pp:128; WP: pp560, which does not deal with the same situation). The point here is that some, having done a deed in the past, or being in the habit of doing such deeds in the present, feel the need to keep this behavior secret, and their close followers, who may be aware of the behavior, keep quiet about it to others.<br />
					We have the recent example of the guru who claimed never to eat who was addicted to McDonald's hamburgers, whose secret eating habits were kept from exposure by his close followers. There is also the case of the Catholic Church hiding the child molesting behavior of some priests.<br />
					What is being spoken of here is a freedom from feeling the need to guard against exposure, not freedom from possible exposure or criticism.<br />
					Even the Buddhas face criticism: "They will criticize you when you do right and they will criticize you when you do wrong, and they will criticize you when you do nothing..."<br />
					Certainly today there are those who would criticize and call immoral the Buddha's behavior in leaving his wife and child prior to becoming a Tathāgata (today [7/16/2002], in the USA, he could be subjected to fines and jailed for this!).<br />
					While this freedom from feeling the need to guard is a natural consequence and attribute of Arahantship (because the Arahant has given up any ambitions with regard to the world), it could be the attribute of anyone who gave up the idea of acting on fear of exposure due to the need for wrongly earned fame or a false good reputation. — Having one's past bad or questionable behavior be exposed publicly could certainly be  embarassing, but knowledge of the possibility of embarassment does not necessarily dictate any attempt to hide such or guard against exposure. (What it may do is make one a tad shy of fame, but short of Arahantship, this is not such a bad fear to have (see: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.olds.bd.htm">Fame, Favors and Gains</a>).<br />

					I am becoming more and more convinced that in terms of the way we use the terms "kamma" and "sankhara" today (7/19/02) there is no difference between the two. If there is a difference it is non Buddhist (that is that "kamma" could mean karma in a general, non-individualized sense, where sankara would mean one's own karma — both mean both the act <i>and</i> it's consequences. In the Pali, there is some slight emphasis on the act when "kamma" is used and some slight emphasis on the outcome when "sankhara" is used. There is, in addition, a strong sense of "Identification with" associated with sankhara. To my mind "sankhara" could well have been a word intended to clarify the idea that kamma was not just simply "action" but also the consequences thereof.</p>

However when in the Pali they are found under this heading they have a much more magical, super-normal connotation. Since the idea of Indra (a god of War and Wrath, much like, if not the same as Zeus and Jupiter) was largely replaced in the Buddhist culture by the idea of Sakka (a god of good deeds, respect for the elders, and a Streamwinner), I suspect that what we have in these "faculties" is a carry-over of an old set of power categories with the terms being redefined in the Buddhist sense possibly to make the transition more comprehensiable for those of the older beliefs.

Neither seem to hear a reverberation to skill in entry and exit from the jhanas which is surprising. Here is another case where it would be . . . um. . . skillful to keep in mind that the Dhamma must always be made to be helpful to those at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end, which would dictate a more generic interpretation: whatever āya (ā=to, ya=whatever; PED has ā + ya=i=go, and also aya=income, inlet) is, then <i>ap-āya (apa=ap=from)</i> is it's reverse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> (<i>madā: ārogya-, yobbana-, jāvita-</i>): PED, Walshe, and Rhys Davids all use intoxications, which is a better sounding word here and which conveys the meaning better than "madness." I used madness because it shows the root better.<br />
					Elsewhere these three are called forms of pride (<i>māna</i>)</p>

					PED: <i>Ādhipacca (and Ādipateyya):</i> [from adhi + pati + ya "being overlord"] supreme rule lordship, sovereignty, power; and adhipati: ruler, master, ruling over, governing, predominant, ruled or governed (atta- autonomous, loka- heteronomous, influenced by society)</p>

					There is a book of commentary called the Katha-vatthu: Points of Controversy, tr. S.Z. Aung and Mrs C.A.F. Rhys Davids, 1915, 1993, (where it is clear that 'controversy' is what that book is dealing with).</p>

Understood more broadly as knowing the outcome of deeds, being able to see the workings of kamma.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> (<i>vihārā: dibbo vihāro, Brahma-vihāro, ariyo vihāro</i>)<br />
					Rhys Davids footnotes: "The first is the conscious experience of the 'Eight Attainments' or Jhanas, the second that of the Four Exercises in sublime emotion, the third is that of the Fruitions." This is another case of the commentators confiscating for the service of their own ends concepts which are more broadly aplicable. The godly habitations are attained by the jhanas, but they also include realms attained by simple good deeds; The Brahma abodes are attained by the Four Godly Thoughts (Brahmaviharas) but also by way of the jhanas and excellence of conduct and good deeds; as for the ariyan abodes the greater likelihood is that this is a reference to the Pure Abodes, the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#SUDDHAVASARealms">Suddhavassa Realms</a>. I do not recall anywhere in the suttas where it is stated that the Arahants "live" in any sort of "vihara", or loka or "abode." Additionally, when an individual attains one or another of the jhanas, he is often said to make it his vihara, but this phrase is not used when we hear of someone who has become arahant. This may, in fact simply be a reference to anyone who is on the path.</p>
