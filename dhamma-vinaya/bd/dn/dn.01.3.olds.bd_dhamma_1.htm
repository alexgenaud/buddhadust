At this time, Beggars, beings are, for the most part, reborn in the Abhassara Realm. And there they live made of mind, feeding on friendly vibrations, radiating light, traversing the air, uttering cries of joy — a truly glorious life. And there they remain for a long long time.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p40" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#p40">40</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#p40">pts</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/dn/dn.01.wlsh.wp.htm#p40">bodh</a>]</span> Then there comes a time, Beggars, after a long long time, but sooner or later, when this old world-system begins to re-evolve. At this time the Palace of Mahā Brahmā appears, but it is empty. Then, after a time, either because he has reached the end of his lifetime there, or because his good <i>kamma</i> has done run out, some being falls from the Abhassara Realm and is reborn again in the Palace of Mahā Brahmā. And there he lives, made of mind, feeding on friendly vibrations, radiating light, traversing the air — a truly glorious life. And thus he remains for a long long time.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p41" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#p41">41</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#p41">pts</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/dn/dn.01.wlsh.wp.htm#p41">bodh</a>]</span> Then, after a long long time, but sooner or later, there arises in this being a vague sorta wanta needa gotta hafta hava type-a yearning that develops into the wish: 'O! O! O! If only there were other beings here just like me!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then, as if by magic, either because they had reached the end of their lifetime there, or because their good <i>kamma</i> had done run out, other beings fell from the Abhassara Realm and found consciousness again in the company of Brahmā in the palace of Mahā Brahmā. And these beings were, in every way, identical in appearance with he who had arisen there first.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p42" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#p42">42</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#p42">pts</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/dn/dn.01.wlsh.wp.htm#p42">bodh</a>]</span> Then that being who had first appeared in the Palace of Mahā Brahmā thinks: 'It is I that am Brahmā! Mahā Brahmā. The One on High. The Glory. The Mighty. The All-Seeing. The King. The Lord of All. The Maker. The Creator. The Chief. The Thousand Named. Appointing to each his Rounds. The Ancient of Days. The Father of All there is and All there is to Be. How do I know? Because these beings came to be as I wished them to come to be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And in their turn, those beings too thought: 'This is Brahmā! Mahā Brahmā. The One on High. The Glory. The Mighty. The All-Seeing. The King. The Lord of All. The Maker. The Creator. The Chief. The Thousand Named. Appointing to each his Rounds. The Ancient of Days. The Father of All there is and All there is to Be. How do we know?

					<p class="f4">So then it might happen, Beggars, that some being falls from that existence with Mahā Brahmā and finds consciousness again here. And having come to this state of things, he might give up the household life and take up the homeless life and become a shaman.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he, by means of energy, of exertion, of application, of earnestness, of careful thought, reaches up to such single-mindedness of intent that, rapt in mind, he remembers back to his previous habitation but no further, and he concludes: 'That Brahmā! Mahā Brahmā. The One on High. The Glory. The Mighty. The All-Seeing. The King. The Lord of All. The Maker. The Creator. The Chief. The Thousand Named. Appointing to each his Rounds. The Ancient of Days. The Father of All there is and All there is to Be. He is unchanging, eternal, unshakable, of a nature to last forever and ever, but those of us created by him are subject to change, impermanent, subject to time, of limited lifespan.'</p>
