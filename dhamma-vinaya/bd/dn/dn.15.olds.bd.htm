The way I was taught this is helpful. Think of what it is that is required in order to make a cup of tea. Tea, water, a cup, heat to heat the water, a teapot, a teakettle, the effort of an individual ... and a virtually unlimited number of related things. No thing there can be said to be 'the cause' of the cup of tea. One thing can be said to be an essential ingrediant: the tea. Without the tea it would not be possible to make a cup of tea. One might say: 'Without the water, no cup of tea could be made either,' but that is to take the argument off into another direction. We are looking for the single-most proximate requisite for the result, or, as in our case here, which would result in the prevention of the progression of the series.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Upādāna. That which fuels the fire. This is thinking and pondering and intending with regard to the just previous stimulus of the senses which has produced a sensation and thirst. This would be the situation just before sankharaming, or own-making, and would be a point where the cycle could be ended.</p>
