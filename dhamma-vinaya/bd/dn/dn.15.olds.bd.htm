					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ida-p-paccayā.</i> Here-percuss, result, rebound. <i>Bhk.</i> Thanissaro's: 'demonstrable requisite condition' is also good. The way I was taught this is helpful. Think of what it is that is required in order to make a cup of tea. Tea, water, a cup, heat to heat the water, a teapot, a teakettle, the effort of an individual ... and a virtually unlimited number of related things. No single or group of things there can be said to be 'the cause' of the cup of tea. One thing can be said to be an essential ingredient: the tea. Without the tea it would not be possible to make a cup of tea even with all the other elements present. One might say: 'Without the water, no cup of tea could be made either,' but that is to take the argument off into another direction. We are looking for the single-most proximate requisite for the result, or, as in our case here, which would result in the prevention of the progression of the series.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">A great deal of confusion has resulted from the attempt to force this formula into the idea of "cause and effect". At one point I made a chart of who it was that was ultimately responsible for me knowing who. I found that 99% of the people I knew depended upon my first having met a certain friend at college, in turn, my going to this college depended upon my uncle, in turn knowing my uncle depended upon my having had a particular person as my mother, a particular person as my father. That sort of dependent association is what is intended here, not cause and effect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Upādāna.</i> That which fuels the fire. This is thinking and pondering and intending and planing and making an effort to get or get away from or to end <i>kamma</i> with regard to the just previous stimulus of the senses which has produced a sensation and thirst. This would be the situation just before <i>saṅkhāraming,</i> or own-making, and would be a point where the cycle could be ended.</p>
