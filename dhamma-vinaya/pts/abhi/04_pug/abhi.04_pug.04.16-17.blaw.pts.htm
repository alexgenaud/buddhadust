					<p class="f4">16. <i>How is a person a speaker in dispraise of a person unworthy of praise after inquiring into and scrutinising (his nature)?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a certain person rightly speaks in dispraise of the heretics or their disciples, who are wrongly and badly regulated as to conduct, saying that they are badly as well as wrongly conducted. Thus is a person a speaker in dispraise of an unworthy person after inquiring into and scrutinising (his nature).</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How is a person a speaker in praise of a praiseworthy person after inquiring into and scrutinising (his nature)?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a certain person speaks rightly in praise of the Buddhas and their disciples, who are well and perfectly regulated in conduct, saying that they are well and perfectly conducted. Such a person is a speaker in praise of a praiseworthy man after inquiring into and scrutinising (his nature).</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How is a person one who finds dissatisfaction in an unsatisfactory thing after, etc.?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a certain person finds dissatisfaction in a bad and wrong course, saying that this is a bad path, this is a wrong path. Such a person is one who finds dissatisfaction, etc.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How is a person one who finds satisfaction in a satisfactory thing after inquiring into and scrutinising it?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">17. <i>How is a person one who speaks in dispraise of a person unworthy of praise, expressing what is true and right at the right time about him, but does not in the same way speak in praise of what is praiseworthy?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a person, when there is something creditable as well as something discreditable (in regard to a person), speaks about the latter, expressing what is true and right at the right time, but does not speak in the same way about the something <a id="pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> creditable. It is thus that a man speaks in dispraise of a person unworthy of praise, expressing what is true and right at the right time about him, but does not in the same way speak in praise of what is praiseworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How does a person speak in praise of a person worthy of praise, expressing what is true and right at the right time about him, but does not in the same way speak in dispraise of what is unworthy of praise?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a person, when there is something creditable as well as something discreditable (in regard to a person), speaks about the former, expressing what is true and right at the right time but does not in the same way speak about the latter. It is thus that a person speaks in praise of a person worthy of praise, expressing what is true and right at the right time about him, but does not in the same way speak in dispraise of what is unworthy of praise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How does a person speak in dispraise of a person unworthy of praise and in praise of the praiseworthy, expressing what is true and right at the right time?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a person, when there is something creditable as well as something discreditable (in regard to a person), speaks about the latter and also about the former, expressing what is true and right at the right time, being aware of the proper time for answering the question put to him. It is thus that a person speaks in dispraise of a person unworthy of praise and in praise of the praiseworthy, expressing what is true and right at the right time.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How does a person neither speak in dispraise of a person unworthy of praise nor speak in praise of a person worthy of praise, expressing what is true and right at the right time?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a person, when there is something creditable as well as something discreditable (in regard to a person), speaks neither about the former nor about the latter, expressing what is true and right at the right time, but keeps up an indifferent attitude, being mindful and thoughtful. It is thus that a person neither speaks in dispraise of a person unworthy of <a id="pg70"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></a> praise nor speaks in praise of a person worthy of praise, expressing the right thing at the right time.</p>
