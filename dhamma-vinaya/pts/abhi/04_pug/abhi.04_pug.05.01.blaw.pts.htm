					<p class="f4">There a certain person who acts and becomes remorseful, who does not know emancipation of mind and emancipation of insight as it really is, wherein his sinful and bad qualities which have arisen are totally destroyed, he should be told thus: 'of the revered one the sinful tendencies which are due to actions exist, and the sinful tendencies which are due to remorsefulness increase. It were well if the revered one gave up sinful tendencies due to his actions and suppressed sinful tendencies due to remorse, and practised thought and insight.' Thus the revered one will become equal to the fifth person in this group.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There a certain person who does not act, and [yet] becomes remorseful, who does not know emancipation of mind and emancipation of insight as it really is, wherein his sinful and bad qualities which have arisen are totally destroyed, he should be told thus: 'of the revered one the sinful tendencies due to actions do not exist and the sinful tendencies due to remorsefulness increase. It were well if the revered one removed the sinful tendencies due to remorsefulness, and <a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> practised thought and insight.'
