					<p class="f4"><i>Who are the four persons comparable to trees?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The four kinds of trees are as follows — one itself weak but surrounded by strong ones; one itself strong but surrounded by weak ones; one itself weak and surrounded by weak ones; one itself strong and surrounded by strong ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">The four types of person likened respectively unto these four classes of trees exist in this world — a person himself weak but surrounded by the strong; a person himself strong but surrounded by the weak; a person himself weak and surrounded by the weak; a person himself strong and surrounded by the strong.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> <i>How is a person who himself is weak surrounded by the strong?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a certain person is of bad morals, wicked, while his associates<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> are moral men of lovely nature. Thus is a person who himself is weak surrounded by the strong, just in the same way as a weak tree is surrounded by strong ones.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How is a person who is strong surrounded by the weak?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a certain person who is moral, of lovely nature, having associates who are immoral, wicked. Thus is a person who is strong surrounded by the weak, just in the same way as a strong tree is surrounded by weak ones.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How is a person who is immoral, wicked, having associates who are the same? ...</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>How is a person who is strong surrounded by the strong?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Here a certain person who himself is moral and of lovely nature, has similar associates. Thus is a person who is strong surrounded by the strong, just in the same way as a strong tree is surrounded by strong ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four persons comparable to trees existing in this world.</p>
