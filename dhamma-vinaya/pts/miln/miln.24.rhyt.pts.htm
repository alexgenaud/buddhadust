					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>1. 'Venerable Nāgasena, do all the Bodisats give away their wives and children, or was it only Vessantara the king who did so?'</p>

					<p>'All of them do so, not Vessantara only.'</p>

					<p>'Do they then give them away with their own consent?'</p>

					<p>'The wife, O king, was a consenting party. But the children, by reason of their tender age, lamented. Had they thoroughly understood, they too would have approved.'</p>

					<p>'A hard thing, Nāgasena, was it that the Bodisat carried out, in that he gave away his own children, his only ones, dearly beloved, into slavery to the Brahman. And this second action was harder still, that he bound his own children, his only ones, and dearly beloved, young and tender though they were, with the jungle rope, and then, when he saw them being dragged along<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> by the Brahman, -- their hands <a id="pg115"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span></a> bruised by the creeper, -- yet could look on at the sight. And this third action was even harder still, that when his boy ran back to him, after loosing the bonds by his own exertion, then he bound him again with the jungle rope and again gave him away. And this fourth action was even harder still, that when the children, weeping, cried: "Father dear, this ogre is leading us away to eat us!" he should have appeased them by saying: "Don't be afraid." And this fifth action was even harder still, that when the prince, <i>G</i>āli, fell weeping at his feet, and besought him, saying: "Be satisfied, father dear, only keep Kaṇhāginā (his little sister). I will go away with the ogre. Let him eat me!"--that even then he would not yield. And this sixth action was even harder still, that when the boy <i>G</i>āli, lamenting, exclaimed: "Have you a heart of stone then, father, that you can look upon us, miserable, being led away by the ogre into the dense and haunted jungle, and not call us back?"--that he still had no pity. And this seventh action was even harder still, that when his children were thus led away to nameless horrors until they passed gradually to their bitter fate,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> out of sight -- that then his heart did not break, utterly break! What, pray, has the man who seeks to gain merit to do with bringing sorrow on others! Should he not rather give himself away?'</p>

					<p>2. 'It is because what he did, O king, was so <a id="pg116"><span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span></a> difficult, that the sound of the fame of the Bodisat was spread abroad among gods and men through the ten thousand world systems -- that the gods exalt him in heaven; and the Titans in the Titan-world, and the Garuḍas in their abodes, and the Nāgas in the Nāga-world, and the Yakshas where they dwell--that through the ages the reputation of this his glory has been handed down by successive tradition--till now, to-day, it has reached to this meeting of ours, at which we sitting are, forsooth, disparaging and casting a slur on that gift,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> debating whether it were well given or ill! But that high praise, O king, shows forth the ten great qualities of the intelligent, and wise, and able, and subtle-minded Bodisats. And what are the ten? Freedom from greed, the not clinging (to any worldly aim), self-sacrifice, renunciation, the never turning back again (to the lower state), the equal delicacy and greatness, the incomprehensibility, the rarity, and the peerlessness of Buddhahood. In all these respects is it that the fame of that giving shows forth the great qualities of the Bodisats.'</p>

					<p>3. 'What, venerable Nāgasena? he who gives gifts in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others--does that giving of his bring forth fruit in happiness, does it lead to rebirth in states of bliss?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, O king. What can be said (to the contrary)?'</p>

					<p>'I pray you, Nāgasena, give me a reason for this.'</p>

					<p>'Suppose, O king, there were some virtuous Samaṇa or Brahman, of high character, and he were <a id="pg117"><span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span></a> paralysed, or a cripple,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> or suffering from some disease or other, and some man desirous of merit were to have him put into a carriage, and taken to the place he wished to go to. Would happiness accrue to that man by reason thereof, would that be an act leading to rebirth in states of bliss?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, Sir. What can be said (to the contrary)? That man would thereby acquire a trained elephant, or a riding-horse, or a bullock-carriage, on land a land-vehicle and on water a water-vehicle, in heaven a vehicle of the gods<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and on earth one that men could use, -- from birth to birth there would accrue to him that which in each would be appropriate and fit,--and joys appropriate would come to him, and he would pass from state to state of bliss, and by the efficacy of that act mounting on the vehicle of Iddhi he would arrive at the longed-for goal, the city of Nirvāṇa itself.'</p>

					<p>'But then, O king, a gift given in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others does bring forth fruit in happiness, does lead to rebirth in states of bliss, -- inasmuch as that man by putting the cart-bullocks to pain would attain such bliss.</p>

					<p>4. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing. Suppose some monarch were to raise from his subjects a righteous tax, and then by the issue of a command were to bestow thereout a gift, would that monarch, O king, enjoy any happiness on that account, would that be a gift leading to rebirth in states of bliss?</p>

					<p><a id="pg118"><span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span></a> 'Certainly, Sir. What can be said against it? On that account the monarch would receive a hundred thousandfold, he might become a king of kings, a god above the gods, or Brahmā lord of the Brahmā gods, or a chief among the Samanas, or a leader of the Brahmans, or the most excellent among the Arahats.'</p>

					<p>'Then, O king, a gift given in such a way as to bring sorrow upon others does bring forth fruit in happiness, does lead to rebirth in states of bliss -- inasmuch as that monarch by giving as a gift what was gained by harassing his people with taxation would enjoy such exceeding fame and glory.'</p>

					<p>5. 'But, venerable Nāgasena, what was given by Vessantara the king was an excessive gift; in that he gave his own wife as wife to another man, and his own children, his only ones, into slavery to a Brahman. And excessive giving is by the wise in the world held worthy of censure and of blame. Just, Nāgasena, as under too much weight the axle-tree of a cart would break, or a ship would sink, as his food would disagree with him who ate too much, or the crops would be ruined by too heavy rain, or bankruptcy would follow too lavish generosity, or fever would come from too much heat, or a man would go mad from excessive lust, or become guilty of an offence through excessive anger, or fall into sin through excessive stupidity, or into the power of robbers through too much avarice, or be ruined by needless fear, or as a river would overflow through excessive inflow, or a thunderbolt fall through too much wind, or porridge boil over through too hot a fire, or a man who wandered <a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> about too much<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> would not live long-just, so, Nāgasena, is excessive giving held by the wise in the world as worthy of censure and of blame. And as king Vessantara's gift was excessive no good result could be expected from it.'</p>

					<p>6. 'Giving exceedingly,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> O king, is praised, applauded, and approved by the wise in the world; and they who give away anything as a gift just as it may occur to them,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> acquire fame in the world as very generous givers. Just, O king, as when a man has taken hold of a wild root which by its extraordinary virtues is divine, that moment he becomes invisible even to those standing within arm's length -- just as a medicinal herb by the exceeding power of its nature will utterly kill pain, and put an end to disease -- just as fire burns by its exceeding heat, and water puts that fire out by its exceeding cold -- just as by its exceeding purity a lotus remains undefiled by water or by mud -- just as a (magic) gem by the extraordinary virtue inherent in it procures the granting of every wish -- just as lightning by its marvellous quick sharpness cleaves asunder even the diamonds, pearls, and crystals--just as the earth by its exceeding size can support men, and snakes, and wild beasts, and birds, and the waters, <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> and rocks, and hills, and trees -- just as the ocean by its exceeding greatness can never be quite filled -- just as Sineru by its mighty weight remains immoveable, and space by the greatness of its wide extent is infinite, and the sun by its mighty glory dissipates the darkness -- just as the lion in the greatness of its lineage is free from fear -- just as a wrestler in the greatness of his might easily lifts up his foe-just as a king by the excellence of his justice becomes overlord, and a Bhikkhu by reason of his very righteousness becomes an object of reverence to Nāgas, and Yakshas, and men, and Māras -- just as a Buddha by the excellence of his supremacy is peerless -- just so, O king, is exceeding generosity praised, applauded, and approved by the wise in the world; and they who give away anything as a gift, just as it may occur to them, acquire in the world the fame of being nobly generous. And by his mighty giving Vessantara the king, O king, was praised, and lauded, and exalted, and magnified, and famous throughout the ten thousand world systems, and by reason, too, of that mighty giving is it that he, the king Vessantara, has, now in our days, become the Buddha, the chief of gods and men.</p>

					<p>7. 'And now, O king, tell me -- is there anything in the world which should be withheld as a gift, and not bestowed, when one worthy of a gift, one to whom it is one's duty to give,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> is there?'</p>

					<p><a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> 'There are ten sorts of gifts, Nāgasena, in the world that are commonly disapproved of as gifts. And what are the ten? Strong drink, Nāgasena, and festivals in high places,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> and women, and buffaloes, and suggestive paintings,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> and weapons, and poison, and chains, and fowls, and swine, and false weights and measures. All these, Nāgasena, are disapproved of in the world as gifts, and those who give such presents become liable to rebirth in states of woe.'</p>

					<p>'I did not ask you, O king, what kinds of gifts are not approved of. But this, O king, I asked: "Is there anything in the world which ought to be withheld, and not bestowed as a gift, if one worthy of a gift were present?"'</p>

					<p>'No, Sir. When faith arises in their hearts some give food to those worthy of gifts, and some give clothes, and some give bedding, and some give dwellings, and some give mats or robes, and some give slave girls or slaves, and some give fields or premises, and some give bipeds or quadrupeds, and <a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> some give a hundred<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> or a thousand or a hundred thousand, and some give the kingdom itself, and some give away even their own life.'</p>

					<p>'But then, O king, if some give away even their own lives, why do you so violently attack<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> Vessantara, that king of givers, for the virtuous bestowal of his child and wife? Is there not a general practice in the world, an acknowledged custom, according to which it is allowable for a father who has fallen into debt, or lost his livelihood, to deposit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> his son in pledge, or sell him?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, that is so.'</p>

					<p>'Well, in accordance therewith was it that Vessantara, O king, in suffering and distress at not having obtained the insight of the Omniscient Ones, pledged and sold his wife and children for that spiritual treasure. So that he gave away what other people had given away, he did what other people had done. Why then do you, O king, so violently attack him, the king of givers?'</p>

					<p><a id="pg123"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span></a> 8. 'Venerable Nāgasena, I don't blame him for giving, but for not having made a barter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> with the beggar, and given away himself rather, instead of his wife and children.'</p>

					<p>'That, O king, would be an act of a wrong doer, to give himself when he was asked for his wife and children. For the thing asked for, whatever it is, is that which ought to be given. And such is the practice of the good. Suppose, O king, a man were to ask that water should be brought, would any one who then brought him food have done what he wanted?'</p>

					<p>'No, Sir. The man who should have given what he first asked to be brought would have done what he wanted.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, when the Brahman asked Vessantara the king for his wife and children, it was his wife and children that he gave. If the Brahman, O king, had asked for Vessantara's body, then would Vessantara have not saved his body, he would neither have trembled nor been stained (by the love of self), but would have given away and abandoned his own body. If, O king, any one had come up to Vessantara the king, and asked of him, saying: "Become my slave," then would he have given away and abandoned his own self, and in so giving would he have felt no pain.</p>

					<p>9. 'Now the life of king Vessantara, O king, was a good thing shared in by many -- just as meats when cooked are shared in by many, or as a tree covered with fruit is shared in by many flocks of <a id="pg124"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span></a> birds. And why so? Because he had said to himself: "Thus acting may I attain to Buddhahood." As a man in need, O king, who is wandering about in his search after wealth, will have to pass along goat-tracks, and through jungles full of stakes and sticks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> and doing merchandise by sea and land, will devote his actions, words, and thoughts to the attainment of wealth--just so, O king, did Vessantara, the king of givers, who was longing for the treasure of Buddhahood, for the attainment of the insight of the Omniscient Ones, by offering up to anyone who begged of him his property and his corn, his slave girls and his slaves, his riding animals and carriages, all that he possessed, his wife and children and himself, seek after the Supreme Enlightenment. Just, O king, as an official who is anxious for the seal,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> and for the office of the custody thereof, will exert himself to the attainment of the seal by sacrificing everything in his house -- property and corn, gold and silver, everything -- just so, O king, did Vessantara, the king of givers, by giving away all that he had, inside his house and out,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> by giving even his life for others, seek after the Supreme Enlightenment.</p>

					<p>10. 'And further, O king, Vessantara, the king of givers, thought thus: "It is by giving to him precisely what he asks for, that I shall be of service <a id="pg125"><span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span></a> to the Brahman:" and therefore did he bestow upon him his wife and children. It was not, O king, out of dislike to them that he gave them away, not because he did not care to see them more, not because he considered them an encumbrance or thought he could no longer support them, not (in annoyance) with the wish of being relieved of what was not pleasant to him--but because the jewel treasure of omniscience was dear to him, for the sake of the insight of the Omniscient Ones, did he bestow that glorious gift,--immeasurable, magnificent, unsurpassed--of what was near and dear to him, greatly beloved, cherished as his own life, his own children and his wife! For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god of gods, in the <i>K</i>ariyā Piṭaka:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>"'Twas not through hatred<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> of my children sweet,<br />
					'Twas not through hatred of my queen, Maddī,<br />
					Thraller of hearts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> -- not that I loved them less --<br />
					But Buddhahood more, that I renounced them all."</p>

					<p><a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> 'Now at that time, O king, Vessantara, when he had given away his wife and children, entered the leaf hut, and sat down there. And heavy grief fell upon him distressed by his exceeding love for them, and his very heart<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> became hot, and hot breath, too much to find its way through the nose, came and went through his mouth, and tears rolled in drops of blood from his eyes. Such was the grief, O king, with which Vessantara gave to the Brahman his wife and children in the thought that his practice of giving should not be broken in upon. But there were two reasons, O king, why he thus gave them away. What are those two? That his practice of giving should not be interrupted was one; the other was that as a result of his so doing his children, distressed by living with him only on wild roots and fruits, should eventually be set free by their new master. For Vessantara knew, O king: "No one is capable of keeping my children as slaves. Their grandfather will ransom the children, and so they will come back to me." These are the two reasons why he gave his children away to the Brahman.</p>

					<p>12. 'And further, O king, Vessantara knew:</p>

					<p>"This Brahman is worn out, aged, well stricken in years, weak and broken, leaning on a stick, he has drawn near the end of his days, his merit is small, he will not be capable of keeping my children as <a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> slaves." Would a man be able, O king, by his ordinary power, to seize the moon and the sun,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> mighty and powerful as they are, keeping them in a basket or a box, to use them, deprived of their light, as plates?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'Neither, O king, could any one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, who were to the world like the moon and the sun in glory.</p>

					<p>13. 'And hear another reason, O king, for the same thing.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span> That wondrous gem, O king of a sovran overlord, bright and beautiful, with its eight facets so well cut, four cubits in thickness, and in circumference<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> as the nave of a cart-wheel, could no man, wrapping it up in a cloth and putting it into a basket, keep and use as a hone<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> to grind his scissors<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> upon. And neither, O king, could any one soever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, like to the jewels of the lord of the world in glory.</p>

					<p>14. 'And hear, O king, another reason. just as the elephant king Uposatha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> gentle and handsome, eight cubits in height and nine in girth and length, showing the signs of rut in three places on his body, all white, sevenfold firm,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> could never by any one<a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> be covered up with a saucer<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> or a winnowing fan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> could never be put into a cowpen like a calf, or made use of as one; just so could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, who were, in the world, like Uposatha the elephant king.</p>

					<p>15. 'And hear, O king, another reason. Just, O king, as the mighty ocean is great in length and breadth, and deep, not to be measured, and hard to cross, impossible to fathom or to cover up, and no one could close it in and make use of it as a single ferry, just so could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, as esteemed in the world as the mighty ocean.</p>

					<p>16. 'And hear another reason, O king. Just as the Himālaya, the king of the mountains, five leagues high, and three thousand leagues in extent at the circumference, with its ranges of eight and forty thousand peaks, the source of five hundred rivers, the dwelling-place of multitudes of mighty -- creatures,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span> the producer of manifold perfumes, enriched with hundreds of magical drugs, is seen to rise aloft, like a cloud, in the centre (of the earth); like it, O king, could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of Vessantara, as esteemed in the world as Himālaya, the mountain king.</p>

					<p>'And hear another reason, O king. Just as a <a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> mighty bonfire burning on a mountain top would be visible afar off in the darkness and the gloom of night, so was Vessantara the king well known among men, and therefore could no one whatever keep in use, as his slaves, the children of so distinguished a man -- for just as at the time of the flowering of the Nāga trees<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span> in the Himālaya mountains, when the soft winds (of spring)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span> are blowing, the perfume of the flowers is wafted for ten leagues, or for twelve, so was the sound of the fame of king Vessantara noised abroad, and the sweet perfume of his righteousness wafted along for thousands of leagues, even up to the abodes of the Akani<i>tth</i>a, (the highest of all) gods, passing on its way the dwelling places of the gods and Asuras, of the Garudas and Gandhabbas, of the Yakshas and Rākshasas, of the Mahoragas and Kinnaras, and of Indra the monarch of the gods!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> Therefore is it that no one could keep his children as slaves.</p>

					<p><a id="pg131"><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></a> 17. 'And the young prince <i>G</i>āli, O king, was instructed by his father, Vessantara, in these words: "When your grandfather, my child, shall ransom you with wealth that he gives to the Brahman, let him buy you back for a thousand ounces of gold,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span> and when he ransoms your sister Kaṇhā<i>g</i>inā let him buy her back for a hundred slaves and a hundred slave girls and a hundred elephants and a hundred horses and a hundred cows and a hundred buffaloes and a hundred ounces of gold. And if, my child, your grandfather should take you out of the hands of the Brahman by word of command, or by force, paying nothing, then obey not the words of your grandfather, but remain still in subjection<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> to the Brahman." Such was his instruction as he sent him away. And young <i>G</i>āli went accordingly, and when asked by his grandfather, said:</p>

					<p>As worth a thousand ounces, Sir,<br />
					My father gave me to this man;<br />
					As worth a hundred elephants,<br />
					He gave the girl Kaṇhā<i>g</i>inā."'</p>

					<p>'Well has this puzzle, Nāgasena, been unravelled, well has the net of heresy been torn to pieces, well has the argument of the adversaries been overcome and your own doctrine been made evident, well has the letter (of the Scriptures) been maintained while <a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> you have thus explained its spirit! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">Here ends the dilemma as to Vessantara's gift of his wife and children</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">72. Penance</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>18. 'Venerable Nāgasena, did all the Bodisats go through a period of penance, or only Gotama?'</p>

					<p>'Not all, O king, but Gotama did.'</p>

					<p>'Venerable Nāgasena, if that be so, it is not right that there should be a difference between Bodisat and Bodisat.'</p>

					<p>'There are four matters, O king, in which there is such difference. And what are the four? There is a difference as to the kind of family (in which they are born),<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> there is a difference as to their place in the period (which has elapsed since the succession of Buddhas began),<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> there <a id="pg133"><span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></a> is a difference as to the length of their individual lives,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span> there is a difference as to their individual size.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> In these four respects, O king, there is a difference between Bodisat and Bodisat. But there is no difference between any of the Buddhas, who are alike in bodily beauty,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span> in goodness of character, in power of contemplation and of reasoning, in emancipation, in the insight arising from the knowledge of emancipation, in <a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> the four bases of confidence,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span> in the ten powers of a Tathāgata,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span> in the sixfold special <a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span> in the fourteenfold knowledge of Buddha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span> in the eighteen characteristics of a Buddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span> -- in a word, in all the qualities of a Buddha. For all the Buddhas are exactly alike in all the Buddha-qualities.'</p>

					<p>'But if, Nāgasena, that be so, what is the reason that it was only the Gotama Bodisat who carried out the penance?'</p>

					<p>'Gotama the Bodisat had gone forth from the world, O king, when his knowledge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span> was immature, and his wisdom was immature. And it was when he was bringing that immature knowledge to maturity that he carried out the penance.'</p>

					<p>19. 'Why then, Nāgasena, was it that he thus went forth with knowledge and with wisdom immatured? Why did he not first mature his knowledge, and then, with his knowledge matured, renounce the world?'</p>

					<p>'When the Bodisat, O king, saw the women of his harem all in disorder,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span> then did he become disgusted, <a id="pg136"><span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span></a> and in him thus disgusted discontent sprang up. And on perceiving that his heart was filled with discontent, a certain god of those that wait on Death (Māra) thought: "This now is the time to dispel that discontent of his heart," and standing in the air he gave utterance to these words: "O honourable one! O fortunate one! Be not thou distressed. On the seventh day from this the heavenly treasure of the Wheel shall appear to thee, with its thousand spokes, its tire, and its nave, complete and perfect; and the other treasures, those that walk on earth and those that travel through the sky, shall come to thee of their own accord; and the words of command of thy mouth shall bear sway over the four great continents and the two thousand dependent isles; and thou shalt have above a thousand sons, heroes mighty in strength to the crushing out of the armies of the foe; and with those sons surrounding thee thou, master of the Seven Treasures, shalt rule the world!" But even as if a bar of iron, heated the livelong day and glowing throughout, had entered the orifice of his ear, so was it that those words, O king, entered the ear of the Bodisat. And to the natural distress he already felt there was added, by that utterance of the god, a further emotion, anxiety, and fear. just as a mighty fiery furnace, were fresh fuel thrown on it, would the more furiously burn--just as the broad earth, by nature moist, and already swampy through the water dripping on it from the vegetation and the grass that have arisen on it, would become more muddy still when a great rain cloud had poured out rain upon it--so to the distress that he already felt there was <a id="pg137"><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></a> added, by that utterance of the god, a further emotion, anxiety, and fear.'</p>

					<p>20. 'But tell me, Nāgasena, if the heavenly Wheel-treasure had, on the seventh day, appeared to the Bodisat, would he, the Wheel having appeared, have been turned back from his purpose?'</p>

					<p>'No Wheel-treasure appeared, O king, on the seventh day to the Bodisat. For rather that was a lie that was told by that god with the object of tempting him. And even had it appeared, yet would not the Bodisat have turned aside. And why not? Because the Bodisat, O king, had firmly grasped (the facts of) the impermanence (of all things, of) the suffering (inherent in existence as an individual, of) the absence of a soul (in any being made up of the five Skandhas), and had thus arrived at the destruction of the attachment (to individuality which arises from lust, or from heresy, or from dependence upon outward acts, or from delusions as to the possession of a permanent soul).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span> The water, O king, which flows into the river Ganges from the Anottata lake, and from the Ganges river into the great ocean, and from the great ocean into the openings into the <a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> regions under the earth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn51" href="#n51">51</a>]</sup></span> -- would that water, after it had once entered that opening, turn back and flow again into the great ocean, and from the great ocean into the Ganges river, and from the Ganges river into the Anottata lake?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'In the same way, O king, it was for the sake of that last existence of his that the Bodisat had matured merit through the immeasurable aeons of the past. He had now reached that last birth, the knowledge of the Buddhas had grown mature in him, in six years he would become a Buddha, all-knowing, the highest being in the world. Would then the Bodisat, for the sake of the Wheel-treasure, turn back?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'No! Though the great earth, O king, with all its peaks and mountain ranges, should turn back, yet the Bodisat would not before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the water of the Ganges should flow backwards up the stream, yet the Bodisat would not turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the mighty ocean with its immeasurable waters<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn52" href="#n52">52</a>]</sup></span> should dry up like the water in the footprint of a cow,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn53" href="#n53">53</a>]</sup></span> yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though Sineru, the king of the mountains, <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> should split up into a hundred or a thousand fragments, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the sun and moon with all the stars should fall, like a clod, upon the ground, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood. Though the expanse of heaven should be rolled up like a mat, yet would not the Bodisat turn back before he had attained to Buddhahood! And why not? Because he had torn asunder every bond.'</p>

					<p>21. 'Venerable Nāgasena, how many bonds are there in the world?'</p>

					<p>'There are these ten bonds in the world, O king, bound by which men renounce not the world, or turn back again to it. And what are the ten? A mother, O king, is often a bond, and a father, and a wife, and children, and relations, and friends, and wealth, and easy income, and sovranty, and the five pleasures of sense. These are the ten bonds common in the world, bonds bound by which men renounce not the world or turn back to it. And all these bonds had the Bodisat, O king, burst through. And therefore could he not, O king, turn back.'</p>

					<p>22. 'Venerable Nāgasena, if the Bodisat, on discontent arising in his heart at the words of the god, though his knowledge (of the four Truths) was yet imperfect, and his insight of a Buddha not mature, did nevertheless go forth into renunciation of the world, of what advantage was penance to him then? Ought he not rather, awaiting the maturity of his knowledge, to have lived in the enjoyment of all (suitable) foods?'</p>

					<p>'There are, O king, these ten sorts of individuals who are despised and contemned in the world, <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> thought shameful, looked down upon, held blameworthy, treated with contumely, not loved. And what are the ten? A woman without a husband, O king, and a weak creature, and one without friends or relatives, and a glutton, and one dwelling in a disreputable family, and the friend of sinners, and he whose wealth has been dissipated, and he who has no character, and he who has no occupation,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span> and he who has no means. These are the ten despised and contemned in the world, thought shameful, looked down upon, held blameworthy, treated with contumely, not loved.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span> It was on calling these conditions to mind, O king, that this idea occurred to the Bodisat: "Let me not incur blame among gods and men as being without occupation or without means! Let me as a master in action, held in respect by reason of action, one having the supremacy which arises from action, one whose conduct is based upon action, one who carries action (into every concern of life),<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span> one who has his dwelling in action, be constant in earnestness."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn57" href="#n57">57</a>]</sup></span> That was the spirit, O king, in which the Bodisat, when he was bringing his knowledge to maturity, undertook the practice of penance.'</p>

					<p>23. 'Venerable Nāgasena, the Bodisat, when he was undergoing penance, said thus to himself:</p>

					<p><a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> "But it is not by this penance severe that I shall reach the peculiar faculty of the insight arising from the knowledge of that which is fit and noble--that insight beyond the powers of ordinary men, May there not be now some other way to the wisdom (of Buddhahood)?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn58" href="#n58">58</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Was then the Bodisat, at that time, confused in his mind about the way?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn59" href="#n59">59</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'There are twenty-five qualities, O king, which are causes of weakness of mind, weakened by which the mind cannot successfully be devoted to the destruction of the Āsavas (the Great Evils -- lust, becoming, delusion, and ignorance).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn60" href="#n60">60</a>]</sup></span> And what are the twenty-five? Anger, O king, and enmity, and hypocrisy,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn61" href="#n61">61</a>]</sup></span> and conceit,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn62" href="#n62">62</a>]</sup></span> and envy, and avarice, and deceit,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn63" href="#n63">63</a>]</sup></span><a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> and treachery, and obstinacy,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn64" href="#n64">64</a>]</sup></span> and perverseness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn65" href="#n65">65</a>]</sup></span> and pride, and vainglory, and the intoxication (of exalted ideas about birth or health or wealth), and negligence in (well-doing), and intellectual inertness or bodily sloth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn66" href="#n66">66</a>]</sup></span> and drowsiness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn67" href="#n67">67</a>]</sup></span> and idleness, and friendship with sinners, and forms, and sounds, and odours, and tastes, and sensations of touch, and hunger, and thirst,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn68" href="#n68">68</a>]</sup></span> and discontent.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn69" href="#n69">69</a>]</sup></span> These are the <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> twenty-five qualities, O king, which are causes of weakness of mind, weakened by which the mind cannot successfully be devoted to the destruction of the Āsavas. (And of these it was) hunger and thirst, O king, which had then seized hold of the body<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn70" href="#n70">70</a>]</sup></span> of the Bodisat. And his body being thus, as it were, "possessed," his mind was not rightly devoted to the destruction of the Āsavas. Now the Bodisat, O king, through the immeasurable æons of the past, had followed after the perception of the Four Noble Truths through all of his successive births. Is it then possible that in his last existence, in the birth in which that perception was to arise, there should be any confusion in his mind as to the way? But nevertheless there arose, O king, in the Bodisat's mind the thought: "May there not now be some other way to the wisdom (of a Buddha)?" And already before that, O king, when he was only one month old, when his father the Sakya was at work (ploughing), the Bodisat, placed in his sacred cot for coolness under the shade of the <i>G</i>ambu tree, sat up cross-legged, and putting away passion, free from all evil conditions of heart, he entered into and remained in the first <i>Gh</i>āna--a state of joy and ease, born of seclusion, full of reflection, full of investigation, and so into the second, and so into the third, and so into the fourth <i>Gh</i>āna.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn71" href="#n71">71</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> 'Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say. It was whilst he was bringing his knowledge to maturity that the Bodisat underwent the penance.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">Here ends the dilemma as to the penance undergone by the Bodisat</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">73. Virtue Stronger Than Vice</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>24. 'Venerable Nāgasena, which is the more powerful, virtue or vice?'</p>

					<p>'Virtue, O king.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn72" href="#n72">72</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'That is a saying, Nāgasena, which I cannot believe - that virtue is more powerful than vice. For there are to be seen here (in the world) men who destroy living creatures, who take to themselves what has not been given, who walk in evil in their lusts, who speak lies, who commit gang robberies on whole villages, who are highwaymen, sharpers, and swindlers, and these all according to their crime suffer the cutting off of their hands, or their feet, or their hands and feet, or their ears, or <a id="pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> their nose, or their ears and nose, or the Gruel Pot, or the Chank Crown, or the Rāhu's Mouth, or the Fire Garland, or the Hand Torch, or the Snake Strips, or the Bark Dress, or the Spotted Antelope, or the Flesh Hooks, or the Penny Cuts, or the Brine Slits, or the Bar Turn, or the Straw Seat, or they are anointed with boiling oil, or eaten by dogs, or are impaled alive, or are beheaded with a sword.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span> Some of them sin one night and that night experience the fruit of their sin, some sinning by night experience the next day, some sinning one day experience that day, some sinning by day experience that night, some experience when two days or three have elapsed. But all experience in this present visible world the result of their iniquity. And is there any one, Nāgasena, who from having provided a meal with all its accessories<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span> for one, or two, or three, or four, or five, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand (members of the Order), has enjoyed in this present visible world wealth or fame or happiness--(is there any one who) from righteousness of life, or from observance of the Uposatha, (has received bliss even in this life)?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>25. 'There are, O king, four men who by giving gifts, and by the practice of uprightness, and by the keeping of Uposatha, even in their earthly bodies attained to glory in Tidasapura (the city of the gods).'</p>

					<p><a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> 'And who, Sir, were they?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Mandhātā the king, and Nimi the king, and Sādhīna the king, and Guttila the musician.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Venerable Nāgasena, this happened thousands of births ago, and is beyond the ken of either of us two. Give me, if you can, some examples from that period (of the world) which is now elapsing in which the Blessed One has been alive.'</p>

					<p>'In this present period, O king, the slave Pu<i>nn</i>aka, on giving a meal to Sāriputta the Elder, attained that day to the dignity of a treasurer (Se<i>tth</i>i), and he is now generally known as Pu<i>nn</i>aka the Se<i>tth</i>i. The queen, the mother of Gopāla, who (being the daughter of poor peasant folk) sold her hair for eight pennies, and therewith gave a meal to Mahā Ka<i>kk</i>āyana the Elder and his seven companions, became that very day the chief queen of king Udena. Suppiyā, the believing woman, cut flesh from her own thigh to provide broth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span> for a sick Bhikkhu, and on the very next day the wound closed up, and the place became cured, with skin grown over it. Mallikā, the queen who (when a poor flower girl) gave the last night's gruel (she had reserved for her own dinner) to the Blessed One, became that very day the chief queen of the king of Kosala.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn79" href="#n79">79</a>]</sup></span> Sumana, the garland maker, when he had <a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> presented to the Blessed One eight bunches of jessamine flowers, came that very day into great prosperity. Eka-sāṭaka the Brahman, who gave to the Blessed One his only garment, received that very day the office of Sabba<i>tth</i>aka (Minister in general).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn80" href="#n80">80</a>]</sup></span> All these, O king, came into the enjoyment of wealth and glory in their then existing lives.'</p>

					<p>'So then, Nāgasena, with all your searching and enquiry you have only found six cases?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'That is so, O king.'</p>

					<p>26. 'Then it is vice, Nāgasena, and not virtue which is the more powerful. For on one day alone I have seen ten men expiating their crimes by being impaled alive, and thirty even, and forty, and fifty, and a hundred, and a thousand. And further, there was Bhaddasāla, the soldier in the service of the royal family of Nanda,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn82" href="#n82">82</a>]</sup></span> and he waged war against king <i>K</i>andagutta.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn83" href="#n83">83</a>]</sup></span> Now in that war, Nāgasena, there were eighty Corpse Dances. For they say that when one great Head Holocaust has taken place (by which is meant the slaughter of ten thousand elephants, and a lac of horses, and five thousand charioteers, and a hundred koṭis of soldiers on foot), then the headless corpses arise and dance in frenzy over the battle-field. And all the men <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> thus slain came to destruction through the fruit of the Karma of their evil deeds.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn84" href="#n84">84</a>]</sup></span> And therefore, too, do I say, Nāgasena, that vice is more powerful than virtue. And have you heard, Nāgasena, that in all this dispensation (since the time of Gotama the Buddha) the giving by the Kosala king has been unequalled?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, I have heard so, O king.'</p>

					<p>'But did he, Nāgasena, on account of his having given gifts so unequalled, receive in this present life wealth, or glory, or happiness?'</p>

					<p>'No, O king, he did not.'</p>

					<p>'Then, in that case, surely, Nāgasena, vice is more powerful than virtue?'</p>

					<p>27. 'Vice, O king, by reason of its meanness, dies quickly away. But virtue, by reason of its grandeur, takes a long time to die. And this can be further examined into by a metaphor. just, O king, as in the West Country<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn85" href="#n85">85</a>]</sup></span> the kind of corn called Kumuda-bha<i>nd</i>ikā, ripening quickly and being garnered in a month, is called Māsalu (got in a month),<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn86" href="#n86">86</a>]</sup></span> but the rices only come to perfection in six months or five. What then is the difference, what the distinction herein between Kumuda-bha<i>nd</i>ikā and rice?</p>

					<p>'The one is a mean plant, O king, the other a grand one. The rices are worthy of kings, meet for <a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> the king's table; the other is the food of servants and of slaves.</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, it is by reason of its meanness that vice dies quickly away. But virtue, by its grandeur, takes a long time to die.'</p>

					<p>28. 'But, Nāgasena, it is just those things which come most quickly to their end which are in the world considered the most powerful. And so still vice must be the more powerful, not virtue. just, Nāgasena, as the strong man who, when he enters into a terrible battle, is able the most quickly to get hold of his enemies' heads under his armpit,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn87" href="#n87">87</a>]</sup></span> and dragging them along to bring them prisoners to his lord, that is the champion who is regarded, in the world, as the ablest hero -- just as that surgeon who is able the most quickly to extract the dart, and allay the disease, is considered the most clever -- just as the accountant who is able with the greatest speed to make his calculations, and with most rapidity to show the result, is considered the cleverest counter -- just as the wrestler who is able the most quickly to lift his opponent up, and make him fall flat on his back, is considered the ablest hero -- just so, Nāgasena, it is that one of these two things -- virtue and vice -- which most quickly reaches its end that is, in the world, the more powerful of the two.'</p>

					<p>'The Karma of both the two, O king, will be made evident in future births; but vice besides that will by reason of its guilt be made evident at once, and in this present life. The rulers (Kshatriyas) <a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> of old, O king, established this decree: "Whosoever takes life shall be subject to a fine, and whosoever takes to himself what has not been given, and whosoever commits adultery, and whosoever speaks lies, and whosoever is a dacoit, and whosoever is a highwayman, and whosoever cheats and swindles. Such men shall be liable to be fined or beaten or mutilated or broken<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn88" href="#n88">88</a>]</sup></span> or executed." And in pursuance thereof they held repeated enquiry, and then adjudged one or other punishment accordingly. But, O king, has there ever been by any one a decree promulgated: "Whosoever gives gifts, or observes a virtuous life, or keeps Uposatha, to him shall wealth be given, or honours?" And do they make continued enquiry, and bestow wealth or honours accordingly, as they do stripes or bonds upon a thief?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'Well, if they did so then would virtue too be made evident even in this life. But as they neither make such enquiry concerning givers, nor bestow wealth and honours upon them, therefore is virtue not manifested now. And this is the reason, O king, why vice is made known in this life, whereas he (the giver) receives the more abundantly in the lives to come. And therefore it is virtue which, through the destructions brought about by Karma, is by far the more powerful of the two.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn89" href="#n89">89</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Very good, Nāgasena! Only by one wise as you could this puzzle have been so well solved. <a id="pg151"><span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></a> The problem put by me in worldly sense have you in transcendental sense made clear.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">Here ends the dilemma as to virtue and vice</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr />

					<h4 class="ctr">74. Offerings to the Dead</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>29. 'Venerable Nāgasena, these givers when they bestow their offerings, devote them specifically to former (relatives) now departed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn90" href="#n90">90</a>]</sup></span> saying: "May this gift benefit such and such." Now do they (the dead) derive any benefit therefrom?'</p>

					<p>'Some do, O king, and some do not.'</p>

					<p>'Which then are they that do, and which do not?'</p>

					<p>'Those who have been reborn in purgatory, O king, do not; nor those reborn in heaven; nor those reborn as animals. And of those reborn as Pretas three kinds do not-the Vantāsikā (who feed on vomit), the Khuppipāsino (who hunger and thirst.), the Ni<i>ggh</i>āma-taṇhikā (who are consumed by thirst). But the Paradattūpa<i>g</i>īvino (who live on the gifts of others) they do derive profit, and those who bear them in remembrance do so too.'</p>

					<p>'Then, Nāgasena, offerings given by the givers have run to waste,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn91" href="#n91">91</a>]</sup></span> and are fruitless, since those <a id="pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> for whose benefit they are given derive no profit therefrom.'</p>

					<p>'No, O king. They run not to waste, neither are fruitless. The givers themselves derive profit from them.'</p>

					<p>'Then convince me of this by a simile.'</p>

					<p>'Suppose, O king, people were to get ready fish and meat and strong drinks and rice and cakes, and make a visit on a family related to them. If their relatives should not accept their complimentary present, would that present be wasted or fruitless?'</p>

					<p>No, Sir, it would go to the owners of it.'</p>

					<p>'Well, just so the givers themselves derive the profit. Or just, O king, as if a man were to enter an inner chamber, and there were no exit in front of him, how would he get out?'</p>

					<p>'By the way he entered.'</p>

					<p>'Well, just so the givers themselves derive the profit.'</p>

					<p>30. 'Let that pass, Nāgasena. That is so, and I accept it as you say. We will not dispute your argument. But, venerable Nāgasena, if the offerings made by such givers do advantage certain of the departed, and they do reap the result of the gifts, then if a man who destroys living creatures and drinks blood and is of cruel heart, were after committing murder or any other dreadful act, to dedicate it to the departed, saying: "May the result of this act of mine accrue to the departed"--would it then be transferred to them?'</p>

					<p>'No, O king.'</p>

					<p>'But what is the reason, what is the cause, that a good deed can accrue to them, and not an evil one?'</p>

					<p><a id="pg153"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span></a> 'This is really not a question you should ask, O king. Ask me no foolish question, O king, in the idea that an answer will be forthcoming. You will be asking me next why space is boundless, why the Ganges does not flow up stream, why men and birds are bipeds, and the animals quadrupeds!'</p>

					<p>'It is not to annoy you that I ask this question, Nāgasena, but for the sake of resolving a doubt. There are many people in the world who are left-handed or squint.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn92" href="#n92">92</a>]</sup></span> I put that question to you, thinking: "Why should not also these unlucky ones have a chance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn93" href="#n93">93</a>]</sup></span> of bettering themselves?"'</p>

					<p>'An evil deed, O king, cannot be shared with one who has not done it, and has not consented to it. People convey water long distances by an aqueduct. But could they in the same way remove a great mountain of solid rock?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'Well, just in that way can a good deed be shared, but a bad one cannot. And one can light a lamp with oil, but could one in the same way, O king, light it with water?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'Well, so is it that a good deed can be shared, but not an evil one. And husbandmen take water from a reservoir to bring their crops to maturity, but could they for the same purpose, O king, take water from the sea?'</p>

					<p><a id="pg154"><span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span></a> 'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'So again is it that though a good deed can be shared, an evil one cannot.'</p>

					<p>31. 'But, venerable Nāgasena, why is that? Convince me of this by a reason. I am not blind, or unobservant. I shall understand when I have heard.'</p>

					<p>'Vice, O king, is a mean thing, virtue is great and grand. By its meanness vice affects<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn94" href="#n94">94</a>]</sup></span> only the doer, but virtue by its grandeur overspreads the whole world of gods and men.'</p>

					<p>'Show me this by a metaphor.'</p>

					<p>'Were a tiny drop of water to fall on the ground, O king, would it flow on over ten leagues or twelve?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not. It would only have effect<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn95" href="#n95">95</a>]</sup></span> on that very spot of ground on which it fell.'</p>

					<p>'But why so?'</p>

					<p>'Because o its minuteness.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, is vice minute. And by reason of its littleness it affects the doer only, and cannot possibly be shared. But if a mighty rain cloud were to pour out rain satisfying the surface of the earth, would that water spread round about?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly, Sir. That thunderstorm would fill up the depressions in the ground and the pools and ponds, and the gullies and crevices and chasms, and the lakes and reservoirs and wells and lotus-tanks, and the water would spread abroad for ten leagues or for twelve.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn96" href="#n96">96</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> 'But why so, O king?'</p>

					<p>'Because of the greatness of the storm.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, is virtue great. And by reason of its abundance it can be shared by gods and men.</p>

					<p>'Venerable Nāgasena, why is it that vice is so limited, [<b>297</b>] and virtue so much more wide-reaching?'</p>

					<p>'Whosoever, O king, in this world gives gifts, and lives in righteousness, and keeps Uposatha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn97" href="#n97">97</a>]</sup></span> he, glad, right glad, joyful, cheerful, happy, becomes filled with a sweet sense of trust and bliss, and bliss ruling in his heart his goodness grows still more and more abundantly. Like a deep pool of clear water, O king, and into which on one side the spring pours, while on the other the water flows away; so as it flows away it comes again, and there can be no failure there--so, O king, does his goodness grow more and more abundantly. If even through a hundred years, O king, a man were to keep on transferring<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn98" href="#n98">98</a>]</sup></span> to others (the merit of) any good he <a id="pg156"><span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span></a> had done, the more he gave it away the more would his goodness grow, and he would still be able to share it with whomsoever he would. This, O king, is the reason why virtue is so much the greater of the two.</p>

					<p>32. 'But on doing evil, O king, a man becomes filled with remorse,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn99" href="#n99">99</a>]</sup></span> and the heart of him who feels remorse cannot get away (from the thought of the evil he has done), it is forcibly bent back on it, thrown back on it, obtains no peace;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn100" href="#n100">100</a>]</sup></span> miserable, burning, abandoned of hope, he wastes away, and gaining no relief from depression,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn101" href="#n101">101</a>]</sup></span> he is, as it were, possessed with his woe! just, O king, as a drop of water, falling on a dry river bed with its mighty sandbanks rising and falling in undulations along its crooked and shifty course, gains not in volume, but is swallowed up on the very spot where it fell, just so, O king, is a man, when he has done wrong, overcome with remorse, and the heart of him who feels remorse cannot get away from the thought of the evil he has done, it is forcibly bent back on it, thrown back on it, obtains no peace; miserable, burning, abandoned of hope, he wastes away, and gaining no release from his depression, he is, as it <a id="pg157"><span class="f2 g"><b>[157]</b></span></a> were, swallowed up of his woe. This is the reason, O king, why vice is so mean.'</p>

					<p>'Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">Here ends the dilemma as to Offerings to the Dead</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">75. Dreams</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>33. 'Venerable Nāgasena, men and women in this world see dreams pleasant and evil, things they have seen before and things they have not, things they have done before and things they have not, dreams peaceful and terrible, dreams of matters near to them and distant from them, full of many shapes and innumerable colours. What is this that men call a dream, and who is it who dreams it?'</p>

					<p>'It is a suggestion,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn102" href="#n102">102</a>]</sup></span> O king, coming across the path of the mind which is what is called a dream. And there are six kinds of people who see dreams -- the man who is of a windy humour,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn103" href="#n103">103</a>]</sup></span> or of a bilious one, or of a phlegmatic one, the man who dreams&nbsp;dreams by the influence of a god, the man who does so by the influence of his own habits, and the man who does so in the way of prognostication.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn104" href="#n104">104</a>]</sup></span> And <a id="pg158"><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></a> of these, O king, only the last kind of dreams is true; all the rest are false.'</p>

					<p>34. 'Venerable Nāgasena, when a man dreams a dream that is a prognostication, how is it? Does his own mind set out itself to seek the omen, or does the prognostication come of its own accord into the path of his mind, or does some one else come and tell him of it?'</p>

					<p>'His own mind does not itself seek the omen, neither does any one else come and tell him of it. The prognostication comes of its own accord into his mind. It is like the case of a looking-glass, which does not go anywhere to seek for the reflection; neither does any one else come and put the reflection on to the looking-glass. But the object reflected comes from somewhere or other across the sphere over which the reflecting power of the looking-glass extends.'</p>

					<p>35. 'Venerable Nāgasena, does the same mind which sees the dream also know: "Such and such a result, auspicious or terrible, will follow?"'</p>

					<p>'No, that is not so, O king. After the omen has occurred he tells others, and then they explain the meaning of it.'</p>

					<p>'Come, now, Nāgasena, give me a simile to explain this.'</p>

					<p>'It is like the marks, O king, and pimples, and cutaneous eruptions which arise on a man's body to his profit or loss, to his fame or dishonour, to his praise or blame, to his happiness or woe. Do <a id="pg159"><span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span></a> in that case the pimples come because they know: "Such and such is the event which we shall bring about?"'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir. But according to the place on which the pimples have arisen, the fortune-tellers, making their observations, give decision, saying: Such and such will be the result."'</p>

					<p>'Well, in the same way, O king, it is not the same mind which dreams the dream which also knows: "Such and such a result, conspicuous or terrible, will follow." But after the omen has occurred he tells others, and they then explain the meaning of it.'</p>

					<p>36. 'Venerable Nāgasena, when a man dreams a dream, is he awake or asleep?'</p>

					<p>'Neither the one, O king; nor yet the other. But when his sleep has become light,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn105" href="#n105">105</a>]</sup></span> and he is not yet fully conscious,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn106" href="#n106">106</a>]</sup></span> in that interval it is that dreams are dreamt. When a man is in deep sleep, O king, his mind has returned home (has entered again into the Bhavaṅga),<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn107" href="#n107">107</a>]</sup></span> and a mind thus shut in does not act, and a mind hindered in its action knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn108" href="#n108">108</a>]</sup></span> has no dreams. It is when the mind is active that dreams are dreamt. just, O king, as in the darkness and gloom, where no light is, no shadow will fall even on the most burnished mirror, so when a man is in deep sleep his mind has returned into itself, and <a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a> a mind shut in does not act, and a mind inactive knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not does not dream. For it is when the mind is active that dreams are dreamt. As the mirror, O king, are you to regard the body, as the darkness sleep, as the light the mind. Or again, O king, just as the glory of a sun veiled in fog is imperceptible, as its rays, though they do exist, are unable to pierce through, and as when its rays act not there is no light, so when a man is in deep sleep his mind has returned into itself, and a mind shut in does not act, and a mind inactive knows not the evil and the good, and he who knows not does not dream. For it is when the mind is active that dreams are dreamt. As the sun, O king, are you to regard the body, as the veil of fog sleep, as the rays the mind.</p>

					<p>37. 'Under two conditions, O king, is the mind inactive though the body is there--when a man being in deep sleep the mind has returned into itself, and when the man has fallen into a trance.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn109" href="#n109">109</a>]</sup></span> The mind of a man who is awake, O king, is excited, open, clear, untrammelled, and no prognostication occurs to one whose mind is so. Just, O king, as men seeking concealment avoid the man who is open, candid, unoccupied, and unreserved, -- just so is it that the divine intention is not manifested to the wakeful man, and the man who is awake therefore sees no dream. Or again, O king, just as the qualities which lead to wisdom are found not in that brother whose mode of livelihood and conduct are wrong, who is the friend of sinners, wicked, insolent, devoid <a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></a> of zeal, -- just so is it that the divine intention is not manifested to the wakeful man, and the man who is awake, therefore, sees no dream.'</p>

					<p>38. 'Venerable Nāgasena, is there a beginning, a middle, and an end in sleep?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, O king, there is.'</p>

					<p>'Which then is the beginning, which the middle, and which the end?'</p>

					<p>'The feeling of oppression and inability<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn110" href="#n110">110</a>]</sup></span> in the body, O king, of weakness, slackness, inertness--that is the beginning of sleep. The light "monkey's sleep" in which a man still guards his scattered thoughts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn111" href="#n111">111</a>]</sup></span> -- that is the middle of sleep. When the mind has entered into itself -- that is the end of sleep. And it is in the middle stage, O king, in the "monkey's sleep" that dreams are dreamt. Just, O king, as when a man self-restrained with collected thoughts, stedfast in the faith, unshaken in wisdom, plunges deep into the woods far from the sound of strife, and thinks over some subtle matter, he there, tranquil and at peace, will master the meaning of it--just so a man still watchful, not fallen into sleep, but dozing in a "monkey's sleep," will dream a dream. As the sound of strife, so, O king, are you to regard wakefulness, and as the lonely wood the "monkey's sleep." And as that man avoiding the sound of strife, keeping out of sleep, remaining in the middle stage, will master the meaning of that subtle matter, so the still watchful man, not fallen into sleep, but dozing in a "monkey's sleep," will dream a dream.'</p>

					<p><a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> 'Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">Here ends the dilemma as to dreams<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn112" href="#n112">112</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<h4 class="ctr">76. Premature Death</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>39. 'Venerable Nāgasena, when beings die, do they all die in fullness of time, or do some die out of due season?'</p>

					<p>'There is such a thing, O king, as death at the due time, and such a thing as premature death.'</p>

					<p>'Then who are they whose decease is at the due time, and who are they whose decease is premature?'</p>

					<p>'Have you ever noticed, O king, in the case of mango trees or Gambu trees or other fruit-bearing trees, that their fruits fall both when they are ripe and when they are not ripe?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, I have.'</p>

					<p>'Well, those fallen fruits, do they all fall at the due time, or do some fall prematurely?'</p>

					<p>'Such of those fruits, Nāgasena, as are ripe and mature<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn113" href="#n113">113</a>]</sup></span> when they fall, fall in fullness of time. But of the rest some fall because they are bored into by worms, some because they are knocked down by a <a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> long stick, some because they are blown down by the wind, some because they have become rotten -- and all these fall out of due season.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn114" href="#n114">114</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, those men who die of the effect of old age, they die in fullness of time. But of the rest some die of the dire effect of the Karma (of evil deeds), some of excessive journeying,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn115" href="#n115">115</a>]</sup></span> some of excessive activity.'</p>

					<p>40. 'Venerable Nāgasena, those who die of Karma, or of journeying, or of activity, or of old age, they all die in fullness of time: and even he who dies in the womb, that is his appointed time, so that he too dies in fullness of time; and so of him who dies in the birth chamber, or when he is a month old, or at any age up to a hundred years. It is always his appointed time, and it is in the fullness of time that he dies. So, Nāgasena, there is no such thing as death out of due season. For all who die, die at the appointed time.'</p>

					<p>'There are seven kinds of persons, O king, who, there being still a portion of their appointed age to run, die out of time. And which are the seven? The starving man, O king, who can get no food, whose inwards are consumed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn116" href="#n116">116</a>]</sup></span> -- and the thirsty man who can get no water, whose heart is dried up -- and the man bitten by a snake, who, when consumed by the fierce energy of poison, can find no cure and he who has taken poison, and when all his limbs are <a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> burning, is unable to procure medicine--and one fallen into fire, who when he is aflame, can find no means of putting out the fire--and he who having fallen into water can find no firm ground to stand on--and the man wounded by a dart, who in his illness can find no surgeon--all these seven, there being still a portion of their appointed time to run, die out of due season. And herein (in all these seven cases) I declare that they are all of one nature.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn117" href="#n117">117</a>]</sup></span> In eight ways, O king, does the death of mortals take place--through excess of windy humour, or of bilious humour, or of phlegmatic humour, through the adverse union of these three, through variations in temperature, through inequality in protection, through (medical) treatment, and through the working of Karma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn118" href="#n118">118</a>]</sup></span> And of these, O king, it is only death by the working of Karma that is death at the due season, all the rest are cases of death out of due season. For it is said:</p>

					<p>"By hunger, thirst, by poison, and by bites,<br />
					Burnt, drowned, or slain, men out of time do die;<br />
					By the three humours, and by three combined,<br />
					By heats, by inequalities, by aids,<br />
					By all these seven men die out of time."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn119" href="#n119">119</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>41. 'But there are some men, O king, who die through the working of some evil deed or other they have committed in a former birth. And of <a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> these, O king, whosoever has starved others to death, after having been himself through many hundreds of thousands of years tormented by hunger, famished, exhausted, emaciated, and withered of heart, dried up, wasted away, heated, and all on fire within, will, either as youth or man or old man, die of hunger too. And that death will be to him a death at the appointed time.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn120" href="#n120">120</a>]</sup></span> Whosoever has put others to death by thirst, after having through many hundreds of thousands of years become a Preta consumed by thirst, thin and miserable, will himself too, either as youth or man or old man, die of thirst. And that death will be to him a death at the appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by having them bitten by snakes, will, after wandering through many hundreds of thousands of years from existence to existence, in which he is constantly bitten by boa constrictors and black snakes, himself too, either as youth or man or old man, die of snake bite. And that will be to him a death at the appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by poison will, after existing for many hundreds of thousands of years with burning limbs and broken body, and exhaling the odour of a corpse, himself too, either as youth or man or old man, die of poison. And that will be to him a death at the appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by fire, he having wandered from purgatory<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn121" href="#n121">121</a>]</sup></span> to purgatory, from one mass of burning charcoal to <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> another, with burning and tortured limbs, for many hundreds of thousands of years, will himself too, either as youth or man or old man, be burnt to death. And that will be to him a death at the appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by drowning, he having suffered many hundreds of thousands of years as a being disabled, ruined, broken, weak in limb, and anxious in heart, will himself too, either as youth or man or old man, die by drowning. And that will be to him a death at the appointed time. Whosoever has put others to death by the sword, he having suffered for many hundreds of thousands of years (in repeated births as an animal) from cuts and wounds and blows and bruises, or (when born as a man) ever destroyed by weapons,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn122" href="#n122">122</a>]</sup></span> will himself too, either as youth or man or old man, perish by the sword. And that will be to him a death at the appointed time.'</p>

					<p>42. 'Venerable Nāgasena, the death out of due time that you also speak of -- come now, tell me the reason for that.'</p>

					<p>'As a great and mighty fire, O king, on to which dry grass and sticks and branches and leaves have been heaped, will nevertheless, when this its food has been consumed, die out by the exhaustion of the fuel. Yet such a fire is said to have gone out in fullness of time, without any calamity or accident (having happened to it). Just so, O king, the man who, when he has lived many thousands of days, when he is old and stricken in years, dies at last of <a id="pg167"><span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></a> old age, without any calamity or accident having happened to him, is said to have reached death in the fullness of time. But if there were a great and mighty fire, O king, on to which dry grass and sticks and branches and leaves had been heaped, then if a mighty rain cloud were to pour out rain upon it, and it were thus to be put out, even before the fuel was consumed, could it be said, O king, that that great fire had gone out in fullness of time?'</p>

					<p>'No, Sir, it could not.'</p>

					<p>'But wherein would the second fire differ, in its nature, from the first?'</p>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>51. 'Venerable Nāgasena, are there wonders at the <i>K</i>etiyas (the mounds raised over the ashes) of all who have passed entirely away (of all the Arahats deceased)?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn128" href="#n128">128</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Of some, O king, but not of others.'</p>

					<p>'But of which, Sir, is this the case, and of which not?'</p>

					<p><a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> 'It is by the stedfast resolve, O king, of three kinds of people, that wonders take place at the <i>K</i>etiya of some person deceased who has been entirely set free. And who are the three?

Thus is it that wonders occur by the resolve of an Arahat at the <i>K</i>etiya of one entirely set free.</p>

					<p>'And again, O king, the gods, out of pity for men, show wonders at the <i>K</i>etiya of one who has been entirely set free, thinking: "By this wonder may the true faith remain always established on the earth, and may mankind, believing, grow in grace!" Thus is it that wonders occur by the resolve of a god at the Ketiya of one entirely set free.</p>

					<p>'And again, O king, some woman or some man of believing heart, able, intelligent, wise, endowed with insight, may deliberately take perfumes, or a garland, or a cloth, and place it on the Ketiya, making the resolve: "May such and such a wonder take place!" Thus is it that wonders occur by the resolve of human beings at the <i>K</i>etiya of one entirely set free.</p>

					<p>52. 'These, O king, are the three kinds of people by whose stedfast resolve wonders take place at the <i>K</i>etiyas of Arahats deceased.

					<h4 class="ctr">78. Conversion and Conduct</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>53. 'Venerable Nāgasena, those who regulate their lives aright -- do they all attain to insight into the Truth, or are there some of them who do not?'</p>

					<p>'Some do, O king, and some do not.'</p>

					<p>'Then which do, Sir, and which do not?'</p>

					<p>'He who is born as an animal, O king, even though he regulate his life aright, will not attain to insight into the Truth, nor he who is born in <a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a> the Preta world, nor he who holds wrong views, nor the deceitful man, nor he who has slain his mother, or his father, or an Arahat, nor he who has raised up a schism in the Order, nor he who has shed a Buddha's blood, nor he who has furtively attached himself to the Order,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn131" href="#n131">131</a>]</sup></span> nor he who has become a pervert,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn132" href="#n132">132</a>]</sup></span> nor he who has violated a sister of the Order, nor he who, having been guilty of one or other of the thirteen grievous offences,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn133" href="#n133">133</a>]</sup></span> has not been rehabilitated, nor a eunuch, nor an hermaphrodite -- and whosoever is a human child under seven years of age, even though he regulate his life aright, will not attain to insight into the Truth. To these sixteen individuals there is no attainment of insight, O king, even though they regulate their life aright.'</p>

					<p>54. 'Venerable Nāgasena, there may or may not be a possibility of insight to the fifteen you have first singled out for opposition.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn134" href="#n134">134</a>]</sup></span> But what is the reason why an infant, one under seven years of age, should not, even though he regulate his life aright, attain to insight? Therein there is still a puzzle left. For is it not admitted that in a child there is not passion, neither malice, nor dullness, nor pride, nor heresy, nor discontent, nor lustful thoughts? Being undefiled by sin, that which we call an infant is fit and ready (to the attainment <a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> even of Arahatship -- how much more)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn135" href="#n135">135</a>]</sup></span> is he worthy to penetrate at a glance into the four truths!'</p>

					<p>'The following is the reason, O king, for my saying that an infant, even though he regulate his life aright, cannot attain to insight. If, O king, one under seven years of age could feel passion about things exciting to passion, could go wrong in things leading to iniquity, could be befooled in matters that mislead, could be maddened as to things that infatuate, could understand a heresy, could distinguish between content and discontent, could think out virtue and vice, then might insight be possible to him. But the mind of one under seven years of age, O king, is powerless and weak, mean, small, slight, obscure, and dull, whereas the essential principle of Nirvāṇa is transcendental, important, weighty, wide-reaching, and extensive. Therefore is it, O king, that the infant, with so imperfect a mind, is unable to grasp an idea so great. It is like the case of Sineru, O king, the king of the mountains, heavy and ponderous, wide-reaching and mighty as it is,--could now a man, by his ordinary strength and power and energy, root that mountain up?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn136" href="#n136">136</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'But why not?'</p>

					<p>'Because of the weakness of the man, and because of the mightiness of Sineru, the mountain king.'</p>

					<p><a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> 'Just so, O king, is the relation of the infant's mind to Nirvāṇa.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn137" href="#n137">137</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>55. 'And again, it is like the broad earth, O king, long and wide, great in expanse and extension, large and mighty--would now a tiny drop of water be able to wet and turn to mud that broad earth?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn138" href="#n138">138</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'But why not, O king?'</p>

					<p>'Because of the minuteness of the drop of water, and because of the greatness of the broad earth.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, is the relation of the infant's mind to Nirvāṇa.</p>

					<p>56. 'Or again, O king, suppose there were weak and powerless, minute, tiny, limited, and dull fire--would it be possible, with so insignificant a fire, to overcome darkness and make light appear over the whole world of gods and men?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'But why not, O king?'</p>

					<p>'Because of the dullness of the fire, and because of the greatness of the world.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, the mind of one under seven years of age is powerless and weak, limited, insignificant, obscure, and dull; it is veiled, moreover, with the thick darkness of ignorance. Hard would it be, therefore, for it to shine forth with the light of knowledge. And that is the reason, O king, why to an infant, to one under seven years of age, even though he order his conduct aright, there can be no attainment of insight into the Truth.</p>

					<p><a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> 57. 'Or again, O king, suppose there were a Sālaka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn139" href="#n139">139</a>]</sup></span> minute in the measure of its body, and rendered lean by disease, and it on seeing an elephant king, which showed the signs of rut in three places, and was nine cubits in length, and three in breadth, and ten in girth, and seven in height,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn140" href="#n140">140</a>]</sup></span> coming to its lair, were to begin to drag the elephant towards it with the view of swallowing it--now would the Sālaka, O king, be able to do?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn141" href="#n141">141</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Certainly not, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'But why not, O king?'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, the mind of one under seven years of age is powerless and weak, limited, insignificant, obscure, and dull.

					<h4 class="ctr">79. The Pain Of Nirvāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn143" href="#n143">143</a>]</sup></span></h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>58. 'Venerable Nāgasena, how is it? Is Nirvāṇa all bliss, or is it partly pain?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn144" href="#n144">144</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> 'Nirvāṇa is all bliss, O king. There is no intermingling of pain in it.'</p>

					<p>'That, Sir, is a saying we cannot believe -- that Nirvāṇa is all bliss. On this point, Nāgasena, we maintain that Nirvāṇa must be alloyed with pain. And there is a reason for our adopting that view. What is that reason? Those, Nāgasena, who seek after Nirvāṇa are seen to practise exertion and application both of body and of mind, restraint in standing, walking, sitting, lying, and eating, suppression of sleep, subjugation of the organs of sense, renunciation of wealth and corn, of dear relatives and friends. But all those who are joyful and happy in the world take delight in, are devoted to, the five pleasures of sense -- they practise and delight their eyes in many kinds of pleasurable forms, such as at any time they like the best -- they practise and delight their ears in many kinds of pleasurable sounds of revelry and song, such as at any time they like the best -- they practise and delight their sense of smell with many kinds of perfumes of flowers, and fruits, and leaves, and bark, and roots, and sap, such as at any time they like the best -- they practise and delight their tongue with many kinds of pleasurable tastes of hard foods and of soft, of syrups, drinks, and beverages, such as at any time they like the best -- they practise and delight their sense of touch with many kinds of pleasurable feelings, tender and delicate, exquisite and soft, such as at any time they like the best--they practise and delight their minds with many sorts of conceptions and ideas, pure and impure, good and bad, such as at any time they like the best. You, on the other hand, put a stop to and destroy, <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> maim and mangle, put a drag on and restrain the development of your eye, and ear, and nose, and tongue, and body, and mind. Therefore is your body afflicted and your mind afflicted too, and your body being afflicted you feel bodily discomfort and pain, and your minds being afflicted you feel mental discomfort too and pain. Did not even Māgandiya, the ascetic, find fault with the Blessed One, and say:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn145" href="#n145">145</a>]</sup></span> "The Samaṇa Gotama is a destroyer of increase?"'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn146" href="#n146">146</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>59. 'Nirvāṇa, O king, has no pain in it. It is bliss unalloyed. When you, O king, maintain that Nirvāṇa is painful, that which you call "painful" is not Nirvāṇa. It is the preliminary stage to the realisation of Nirvāṇa, it is the process of seeking after Nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa itself is bliss pure and simple, there is no pain mixed with it. And I will give you an explanation of this. Is there such a thing, O king, as the bliss of sovranty which kings enjoy?'</p>

					<p>'Most certainly.'</p>

					<p>'And is there no pain, O king, mingled with that bliss?'</p>

					<p>'No, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'But surely then, O king, why is it that when their frontier provinces have broken out in revolt, the kings, to the end that they may bring the inhabitants of those provinces into subjection again, leave their homes, attended by their ministers and chiefs, their <a id="pg184"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></a> soldiers and their guards, and marching over ground even and uneven, tormented the while by gnats and mosquitoes and hot winds, engage in fierce fights, and suffer the presentiment of death?'</p>

					<p>'That, venerable Nāgasena, is not what is called the bliss of sovranty. It is only the preliminary stage in the pursuit of that bliss. It is after they have thus, in pain, sought after sovranty, that they enjoy the bliss thereof. And thus that bliss, Nāgasena, is itself unmixed with pain, for the bliss of sovranty is one thing, and the pain another.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, is Nirvāṇa all bliss, and there is no pain mingled with it. Those who are in quest of Nirvāṇa afflict their minds and bodies it is true, restrain themselves in standing, walking, sitting, lying, and in food, suppress their sleep, keep their senses in subjection, abandon their very body and their life. But it is after they have thus, in pain, sought after Nirvāṇa, that they enjoy the Nirvāṇa which is bliss unalloyed--as kings do the bliss of sovranty after their foes have been put down. Thus is it, O king, that Nirvāṇa is all bliss, and there is no pain mingled with it. For Nirvāṇa is one thing, and the pain another.</p>

					<p>60. 'And hear another explanation, O king, of the same thing. Is there such a thing, O king, as the bliss of knowledge which those teachers have who have passed through their course?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, Sir, there is.'</p>

					<p>'Well, is that bliss of knowledge alloyed with pain?'</p>

					<p>'No.'</p>

					<p>'What then, O king, is the good of their afflicting <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> themselves by bowing down before and standing up in the presence of their teachers; by drawing water, and sweeping out the cell, and placing tooth-sticks and washing-water ready; by living upon scraps left over; by doing service in shampooing, and bathing, and washing of the feet; by suppressing their own will, and acting according to the will of others; by sleeping in discomfort, and feeding on distasteful food?'</p>

					<p>'That, Nāgasena, is not the bliss of knowledge, it is a preliminary stage in the pursuit thereof. It is after the teachers have, in pain, sought after knowledge, that they enjoy its bliss. Thus is it, Nāgasena, that the bliss of knowledge is unalloyed with pain. For that bliss of knowledge is one thing, and the pain another.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, is Nirvāṇa all bliss, and there is no pain mingled with it. Those who are in quest of Nirvāṇa afflict their minds and bodies it is true, restrain themselves in standing, walking, sitting, lying, and in food, suppress their sleep, keep their senses in subjection, abandon their very body and their life. But it is after they have thus, in pain, sought after Nirvāṇa, that they enjoy the Nirvāṇa which is bliss unalloyed--as teachers do the bliss of knowledge. Thus is it, O king, that Nirvāṇa is all bliss, and there is no pain mingled with it. For Nirvāṇa is one thing, and the pain another.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">80. The Outward Form Of Nirvāṇa</h4>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>61. 'Venerable Nāgasena, this Nirvāṇa that you are always talking of -- can you make clear by metaphor, or explanation, or reason, or argument, the form, or figure, or duration,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn147" href="#n147">147</a>]</sup></span> or measure of it?'</p>

					<p>'Nirvāṇa, O king, has nothing similar to it. By no metaphor, or explanation, or reason, or argument can its form, or figure, or duration, or measure be made clear.'</p>

Give me some explanation of this.'</p>

					<p>62. 'Very well, O king, I will do so. Is there such a thing, O king, as the great ocean?'</p>

					<p>'Yes, the ocean exists.'</p>

					<p>'Well, suppose some one were to ask you, saying: "How much water is there, your majesty, in the sea, and how many are the creatures that dwell therein?" When that question had been put, how would you answer him?'</p>

					<p>'I should reply thus to such a question: "My good fellow! this is an unaskable thing that you ask me. No one ought to ask such a question. It <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> is a point that should be left alone. The physicists<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn149" href="#n149">149</a>]</sup></span> have never examined into the ocean in that way. And no one can measure the water there, or count the creatures who dwell therein." Thus, Sir, should I make reply.'</p>

					<p>63. 'But why, O king, would you make such a reply about the ocean which, after all, is really an existing condition of things.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn150" href="#n150">150</a>]</sup></span> Ought you not rather to count and tell him, saying: "So and so much is the water in the sea, and so and so many are the creatures that dwell therein?"'</p>

					<p>'That would be impossible, Sir. The question is beyond one's power.'</p>

					<p>'As impossible as it is, O king, to tell the measure of the water in the sea, or the number of the creatures dwelling therein, though after all the sea exists, so impossible is it in any of the ways you suggest to tell the form, or figure, or duration, or measure of Nirvāṇa, though after all it is a condition that does exist. And even, O king, if one of magical powers, master over mind, were to be able to count the water and the creatures in the sea, even he could not tell the form or the figure, the duration or the measure of Nirvāṇa.</p>

					<p>64. 'And hear another explanation of the same thing, O king. Are there, O king, among the gods certain of them called "The Formless Ones?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn151" href="#n151">151</a>]</sup></span></p>

And again, O king, as water allays the thirst of men and beasts when they are exhausted and anxious, craving for drink, and tormented by thirst, so does Nirvāṇa allay the thirst of the craving after lusts, the craving after future life, and the craving after worldly prosperity.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn157" href="#n157">157</a>]</sup></span> This is the second quality of water inherent in Nirvāṇa.'</p>

					<p>'As food, O king, is the support of the life of all beings, so is Nirvāṇa, when it has been realised, the support of life, for it puts an end to old age and death.

And it is that which he who orders his life aright, grasping the idea of all things (of the Confections, Saɱkhāras) according to the teachings of the Conquerors, realises by his wisdom -- even as a pupil, by his knowledge, makes himself, according to the instruction of his teacher, master of an art.</p>

					<p>'And if you ask: "How is Nirvāṇa to be known?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn167" href="#n167">167</a>]</sup></span> it is by freedom from distress and danger, by confidence, by peace, by calm, by bliss, by happiness, by delicacy, by purity, by freshness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn168" href="#n168">168</a>]</sup></span></p>

Just, O king, as a man who, venturing into a strange land, has lost his way, on becoming aware of a path, free from jungle, that will lead him home, bounds forward along it, contented in mind, exulting and rejoicing at the thought: "I have found the way at last!" -- just so in him who thus perceives the insecurity of transitory births there arises the thought: "All on fire is this endless becoming, burning, and blazing!

					<p>85. 'Venerable Nāgasena, does there exist the spot--either in the direction of the East, or of the South, or of the West, or of the North, either above, or below, or on the horizon-where Nirvāṇa is stored up?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn185" href="#n185">185</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'But if so, Nāgasena, then neither can Nirvāṇa exist, and those who realise it, their realisation is vain. And I will give you an explanation of this. Just, Sir, as there are on the earth fields in which crops can be grown, flowers from which perfumes come, bushes on which flowers can grow, trees on which fruits can ripen, mines from which gems can be dug, so that whosoever desires any of these things can go there and get it--just so, Nāgasena, if Nirvāṇa exists one must expect there to be some place, where it is produced.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn186" href="#n186">186</a>]</sup></span> But since there is not, therefore I declare that there can be no Nirvāṇa, and those who realise it, their realisation is vain.'</p>

Just as fire exists, and yet there is no place where fire (by itself) is stored up. But if a man rubs two sticks together the fire comes;--just so, O king, Nirvāṇa exists, though there is no spot where it is stored up.

Hīnaṭi-kumbure (pp. 412-413) construes yādisaɱ as an accusative dependent on atidānadāyī; 'Those who give away anything as a gift, acquire fame in the world as exceeding givers of that.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Dakkhiṇeyya. We have no word in English to express the full meaning of this word. It was an idea that was common ground to our Buddhist apologist, and to the Brahman opponents whom he always has in view, that there were certain people to whom gifts ought to be given, and the being worthy was one of the conditions precedent to belonging to this class. Of course the Brahmans held that to be a Brahman was another condition, but the Buddhist, who inherited the idea from them, had discarded this part of the conception. See, for the Brahman view, Eggeling's <i>S</i>atapatha-Brāhmaṇa II, 114, 344.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Sama<i>gg</i>a-dānaɱ. Childers under sama<i>gg</i>ā gives only the meaning 'assembly,' but it is clear from <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 26; VI, 2, 7; the Sutta Vibhanga II, 267, and Sumaṅgala I, 84, that the word, at least as a masculine (which it is here), has the technical sense of one of those orgies in high places which were common in so many parts of the world in very early times, and were due in India to Kolarian influences. The giving' (dāna) of such a sama<i>gg</i>a would doubtless mean the providing of the necessary food, seats, cushions, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Paripātesi, not in Childers; but see <i>G</i>ātaka II, 208; and below, p. 367 (of the Pāli text). Hīnaṭi-kumbure has here nindā karanne, and just below apasādanaya karanne.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Āvapituɱ, not in Childers. Dr. Morris, in the 'Journal of the Pāli Text Society' for 1886, p. 157, compares the Sanskrit root vyap, but this does not help us much. Hīnaṭi-kumbure (p. 414) has 'an tœneka œpaye hinduwannaṭa,' which means, I think, 'to deposit as a pledge in some place or other.' At all events œpa, the ordinary word now in use in Ceylon courts for 'bail,' may very well be actually derived from vāpa. And the passage at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 321 is an exact parallel to our phrase here, for there the Bodisat, when an elephant, gives away his teeth and tusks as vāpana for the insight of the Omniscient Ones.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Dessa, that is dreshya, from dvish. Compare diso, 'an enemy.' It occurs also at Kariyā Piṭaka I, 4, 7; 5, 3; 8, 16 (quoted <i>G</i>ātaka IV, 406); II, 4, 11; III, 1, 6 (quoted <i>G</i>ātaka I, 46); III, 2, 16; 3, 10; 6, 18. The effect of the use of this rare poetical word is lost in the English version.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Maddī and Kaṇhā<i>g</i>inā, the names of Vessantara's wife and daughter, mean respectively 'enthraller (of men's minds),' and 'the dark conquerors (of hearts).' As Vessantara is used in the Ma<i>ggh</i>ima (I, 386, line 5) as an adjective, not a name, and is applied to the Buddha, it too must have a special meaning. But it can scarcely be connected with Vai<i>s</i>ya, while we have a very famous epithet in vai<i>s</i>vānara, so often applied to the sacred fire as 'common good to all men.' The insertion of the t would explain the shortening of the ā, and though there seems to be no sufficient reason for any alteration at all of the older term, this is probably the real derivation of Vessantara. And the whole legend may well be due to previous stories of the world-wide beneficence of Agni Vai<i>s</i>vānara, or of the sun as Vai<i>s</i>vānara.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Hadaya-vatthu, like a broth-pot foaming over,' is Hīnaṭi-kumbure's explanation of this phrase (pena nœgena mas sœliyak men h<i>ri</i>daya wastuwa, p. 417).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>andima-suriye. We should say 'the sun and the moon,' and I cannot think the difference of phraseology is entirely without significance. While the Brahmans put their own caste and order first, the Buddhist texts talk of 'Samanas and Brahmans,' 'Khattiyas and Brahmans.' This has, and no doubt rightly, been held significant of the opinion of the authors. Why should the fact of their always referring, in similar compounds, to the moon before the sun, and to women before men, be less so? Now it is almost always taken for granted that the Buddhists were reformers, as opposed to the Brahmans, who wanted to run still in the ancient grooves. But there is another side of the question that has been entirely overlooked. There is ample evidence in their literature that (at least in certain directions, more especially of religious thought) the Brahmans had been constantly progressive, and their Brāhmaṇas are really the result of reform following on reform. To use a parallel drawn from modern politics, Buddhists are to Brahmans much more like Socialists to Liberals than like Liberals to Conservatives. The Brahmans had worked out in their minds no new complete system, and when they reformed they left the roots of the old order of things in the ground. But in the momentous change from matriarchate to patriarchate they threw all their power and influence on the side of the newer conception. And when, like Kronos to Jupiter, the old gods gave place to the new, it was they who worked out the newer set of ideas--more especially heaven or sun-worship as against moon-worship and all that it involved. We must not forget that a change of dynasty, or of precedence, among the gods was of more importance to men in those times than a change of dynasty among earthly kings. And though the Buddhists it is true, as we ourselves now, cared for none of these things, and were busied with other discussions than the precedence of the sun and moon, they quite quietly and naturally, when they had to choose, adopted the form of words which did not imply an acceptance of the Brahman position, whose system in other matters they were trying, if not to storm, at least to turn.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We are here in the midst of questions too vast to be discussed with profit in a note. But Buddhism certainly arose among those sections of the community least influenced by the reforms the Brahmans supported. And there is evidence, in the precedence the Buddhists gave to women and to the moon, that the older ideas had not, even then, died out.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> These words are repeated before each of the following similes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Sattappa<i>tth</i>ito. The Siɱhalese merely repeats this ambiguous word (compare IV, 8, 57).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Suppena vā sarāvena vā. Hīnaṭi-kumbure renders the first of these words by kullaka, which is a winnowing-basket; and the second by malāwaka, which I do not understand. But the use of sarāva at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 8, 14 and Sumaṅgala I, 298 seems to me to confirm Childers's rendering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Mahābhūta: 'Yakshas' says Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 419. Compare above, p. 250 (of the Pāli).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Nāga-puppha-samaye. Hīnaṭi-kumbure says, 'at the time when the Nā trees bloom.' The Nā or Nāga is the Mesua ferea, whose lovely flowers, like those of the Champak, are still in special request for laying before the images of the Buddha in Buddhist temples. I am told that these so-called flowers are not flowers at all, botanically speaking, but young shoots. But it is one of the most beautiful sights in a Ceylon landscape to see this splendid forest tree, lofty and wide-spreading as it is, one mass of what look like red blossoms from crown to root. For at the 'bloom time' it casts all its green leaves, and has the appearance of a scarlet bell. No wonder that this was thought supernatural, and that the tree should be called the Nāga tree. Its timber is so valuable that in Anglo-Indian the tree is called the 'Iron-wood' tree. But it may be regretted that the commercial spirit of the European has substituted this hard name for the 'Fairy tree' of the native languages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> U<i>g</i>u-vāta, which the Siɱhalese repeats.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Nikkha-sahassaɱ. See my 'Ancient Coins and Measures,' pp. 6, 14; Samyutta Nikāya II, 3, 9, 3, 9 (Gātaka I, 375, IV, 97; Aṅguttara III, 73, 3).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> Kula-vemattatā. Those Bodisats who are to become Buddhas in their then lives may be born either in a Brahman or in a Kshatriya family, but in no other.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> Addhāna-vemattatā, which is ambiguous, as 'period-difference' may mean different things according to the interpretation given to 'period.' Now the Bodisat theory has never been thoroughly worked out in detail. It is clear from the statements given in pp. 38-58 of my 'Buddhist Birth Stories' that the Bodisat who became Gotama the Buddha was held to have been in existence throughout the whole period in which the former twenty-four Buddhas appeared, and this is probably the 'period' intended. Hīnaṭi-kumbure's version (p. 421) is as ambiguous as the Pāli. Spence Hardy gives at p. 87 of his 'Manual of Buddhism' what purports to be a translation of our passage. But it is only a loose paraphrase, and he interprets this 'period-difference' as simply identical with the next one in the list, the 'length-of-life-difference' -- which must be wrong.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It must be remembered that the Bodisats referred to throughout this dilemma are exclusively men--not those mentioned in the <i>G</i>ātakas (who are all Bodisats of the historical Buddha), but only those Bodisats who became Buddhas in the same life--that is, the Buddhas themselves before they reached Buddhahood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Āyu-vemattatā. This may be due to either of two causes--in the first place they may be born as creatures whose allotted period of life varies. Thus the Bodisat was twenty times Sakka, the king of the gods; and his life would then have lasted hundreds of thousands of years. But he was 106 times an animal of some kind, and then his life would have been of course much shorter. Again, in his births as a man (more than 350 times, see the table in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. ci), the average duration of men's lives will have varied, according to Buddhist theory, from many centuries down to only a few years. It is in this second sense only that (with Hīnaṭi-kumbure) we must suppose the phrase āyu-vemattatā to be used--thus excluding all the Bodisats except such as were men. But in the <i>G</i>ātaka stories the average age of man is (with one or two exceptions) normal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Pamāṇa-vemattatā, which we must also understand to refer only to the varying average size of mankind, which, according to Buddhist theory, is very great at the commencement, and very small at the close, of a Kalpa. For it is only the men-Bodisats, and only in each series the last man-Bodisat (just before he became 'Buddha'), concerning whom this question of penance could arise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> Rūpe, which the Siɱhalese repeats (p. 422), and which cannot here mean bodily form only.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>atu-vesāra<i>gg</i>e. They are the confidence that no one--Samaṇa or Brahman, God or Māra--can reprove him by saying: (1) 'The qualities which you maintain to be those of a Buddha have not been attained by you;' or (2) 'The Great Evils which you maintain to have ceased in an Arahat have not ceased in you;' or (3) 'The qualities which you say are dangerous (in the higher life) are not really dangerous to one who practises them;' or (4) 'The aim which you held before others in preaching your Dhamma will not lead him who follows it to the destruction of sorrow.' The list will be found in the Aṅguttara Nikāya IV, 8 (where it is probably a quotation from one of the conversational Suttas). But the punctuation in Dr. Morris's edition should be corrected by putting full stops after each viharāmi. Childers gives a different explanation under vesāra<i>gg</i>a, but his interpretation must be altered to that here given, which is the only correct one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> These have not been found in any Piṭaka text, but Burnouf gives them in a note to the 'Lotus de la Bonne Loi' (p. 781) from the <i>G</i>inālaṅkāra. He says the expression dasabalo is found as applied to the Buddha '&agrave; chaque instant dans les textes,' but this is not the case, so far at least as the older texts are concerned. In one of the old verses preserved at the Mahāvagga I, 22, 13, and quoted in the <i>G</i>ātaka (vol. i, p. 84), dasabalo occurs as an epithet of the Buddha, but among the numerous epithets applied in the Buddhavamsa to the various Buddhas the term does not occur, nor have I been able to find it in the published portions of any of the great Nikāyas. (Ten Nāga-balas are ascribed to the Buddha in Buddhavamsa, p. 39, but these seem to be different.) Buddha-rakkhita, the author of the <i>G</i>inālaṅkāra, probably lived at about the eleventh or twelfth century A.D., and Hardy's paraphrase of his interpretations (in the 'Manual of Buddhism,' pp. 380, 381) is throughout inaccurate. As therefore it is precisely the growth of ideas about the Buddha that is of prime importance in the history of Buddhism, I give here Buddha-rakkhita's explanation, adding the Sanskrit names as given in the Mahāvyutpatti, § 8:--</p>

I know of no authority for this, and it is incompatible with the Buddhist theory of Arahatship that any Arahat should go through such a period of penance as our author supposes the Bodisat to have done after he had reached this 'destruction of the upādānas.' The perception of the first of the above facts, the impermanence of all things and beings (ani<i>kk</i>am), constitute indeed the 'entrance upon the path' (see above, p. 25), and of course the upādānas are destroyed in every Arahat, but that is very different from Childers's conclusion, which would make the terms convertible.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Appamādo -- that constant theme of praise and exhortation in the early Buddhist books.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> These words, already quoted above, IV, 6, 20 (p. 244 of the Pāli), are put into the mouth of the Bodisat, after the conclusion of the 'penance,' in the Mahā Sa<i>kk</i>aka Sutta (M. I, 246), which is the chief Piṭaka text on the penance (the Dukkha-kārikā). The Siɱhalese version here (p. 427) has already been given in the note on the former passage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> The way to Buddhahood (not the way to Arahatship). This is Hīnaṭi-kumbure's explanation, which agrees with the context.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> It will be noticed that (the destruction of the Āsavas being Arahatship, not Buddhahood) this is really no reply.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> Makkho, 'depreciation of the good qualities of others,' says Hīnaṭi-kumbure, pp. 427, 564. But the use of the word at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 385; Mahāvagga I, 15, 4; <i>K</i>ullavagga III, 34, 2; Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya I, 15, shows that concealing one's own faults is rather the meaning.</p>

This and the last are usually mentioned together (see for instance below, VII, 2, 18), and the contrast is 'concealing the faults one has, and laying claim to virtues one has not.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Māyā. It is noteworthy that this famous word, which plays so great a part in the later philosophies, and which is often supposed to express a fundamental conception of the Buddhists, has not yet been traced, and will probably never be found, in the Piṭakas, in any other than this subordinate and purely ethical sense. So when Mr. Gough in his 'Philosophy of the Upanishads' says, p. 186, that 'pessimism, metempsychosis, and māyā (the primitive world fiction) are retained in Buddhism' he is as wrong about māyā as he is about metempsychosis. He is evidently still under the delusion that Buddhism teaches the transmigration of souls, and that it has inherited from such schoolmen as <i>S</i>aṅkarā<i>k</i>ārya the theory of the māyā. This is as funny as the astounding blindness which makes him say (pp. 267, 268) 'there is no quest of verity of an active law of righteousness (in Buddhism), but only a yearning after a lapse into the void'(!). The converse proposition would be nearer to the actual fact, and the Buddhist Avi<i>gg</i>ā is quite different from the Māyā of the later Vedāntists. How absolutely different is the world in which the thoughts of a Buddhist would move is shown by Hīnaṭi-kumbure's gloss: 'The māyā of concealing faults one has' (tamāge œti aguṇa saɱgawana māyā).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> Thambho (not 'stupor,' as Childers has it). 'That obstinacy of mind (dri<i>dh</i>awū sit œti bawa) which will not bend to the exhortation of the great,' says the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> Sārambho; not merely 'clamour, angry talk,' as Childers has it. See the commentary on the word sārambhī at <i>G</i>ātaka III, 259, with which Hīnaṭi-kumbure here agrees. 'Contrariness' would be perhaps a better rendering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> Thīnamiddhaɱ; so Hīnaṭi-kumbure (but he takes them as two).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Tandī, as Hīnaṭi-kumbure reads (for Mr. Trenckner's nandī).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Khudā pipāsā, which must be taken separately to make up the twenty-five. The Siɱhalese takes them as two.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> Arati, which the Siɱhalese (taking thīna and middha separately) omits.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Pariyādiyiɱsu; literally 'were suffused as to the body of' (Hīnaṭi-kumbure has <i>s</i>arīrayehi vyāpta wū). The passive forms of this verb are always difficult to translate. See above, p. 254, and below, pp. 296, 297 (of the Pāli), and <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 2, 6; VII, 2, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> This passage follows in the Mahā Sa<i>kk</i>aka Sutta immediately after the passage quoted above (Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya I, 246), and the incident is also related at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 57. But in both these books there is reference only to the first--not to the second, third, and fourth <i>Gh</i>ānas. As this is therefore only another instance of the difference between the Piṭakas and the more advanced views of our author, I have not translated the remaining <i>Gh</i>ānas. As will be seen from the version of them in my 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli' (S. B. E., vol. xi, p. 272), the idea that a mere baby could have practised these higher meditations would only become possible after the Buddha theory had been much more developed than it is in the Piṭakas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> Kusalaɱ. So it has been already laid down at III, 7, 7 (pp. 83, 84 of the Pāli), that merit (pu<i>ññ</i>aɱ) is more than demerit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> This is a repetition of the list given above (I, 276-278), where the technical terms are explained. Compare Mr. William Andrews's book, 'Punishments in the Olden Time.'</p>

But we find a particular office so called at Gātaka II, 57. (It is true the reading there is sabbatthaka, but Mr. Trenckner's reading is doubtless preferable.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> All these cases have already been referred to above, I, 172.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> So the Siɱhalese, which seems to follow a slightly different reading.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Upaka<i>kkh</i>ake. The word is not in the: Pāli dictionaries, but I follow Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 432, who renders it Kisilla, and the context at the parallel passage, <i>G</i>ātaka I, 63 (see also <i>G</i>ātaka I, 158, and the Sutta Vibhanga II, 260).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> Bhettabbo, 'have their arms or legs broken.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> In this sentence the translation follows Hīnaṭi-kumbure, who has apparently had a different, and fuller, reading before him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> Petā; which are not ghosts, disembodied 'souls,' but new beings whose link of connection with the departed is, 'not soul,' but Karma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> Vissotaɱ, from sru. The Siɱhalese, p. 434, has āsthāna gata wanneya (for asthāna).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> Vāmagāhino vi<i>k</i>akkhukā. Neither of these words are in the dictionaries. Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 436, says, 'who spoil what they take hold of, and whose eyes have lost their cunning.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> Otāra, which the Siɱhalese renders awakā<i>s</i>aya; and in that sense the word is used at Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya I, 334.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Pariyādiyati. See the note above at IV, 8, 23.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> A similar metaphor is used below, IV, 8, 55 (p. 311 of the Pāli).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> This long list is made up of the two given above at pp. 35, 259 of the Pāli (Paragraphs II, 1, 10 and IV, 6, 55 of the translation).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> The Buddhist Sabbath. See 'Buddhism,' pp. 140, 141.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> Āva<i>gg</i>eya, which the Siɱhalese, p. 437, merely repeats, is ambiguous (literally cause to bend towards'). Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 74, 89, 108, 171 11, 243. In most places the meaning 'bend back or towards' comes to have the secondary sense of 'reflect.' But throughout this discussion there is an underlying reference to a very beautiful Buddhist conception that a man can transfer to others the merit of any good deed he has done. Thus at the end of a palm-leaf manuscript the copyist often adds the pious wish: 'May the merit of my having made this copy redound to the advantage of all men,' or words to that effect. And the preceding metaphor would seem to show that this must be the secondary sense here attached to I causing to bend towards;'--the more he spends (as it were) his virtue, the more remains, just as however much the water flows away from the spring, still quite as much remains, and he can still share with others that which is left. The doctrine of imputed righteousness is not confined to Buddhists, but the Buddhist theory is really quite different from the corresponding Western ideas, even from the Catholic doctrine of the transference of the righteousness of saints.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> So already above, III, 7, 7 (I, 128).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> Patilīyati patikuṭati pativa<i>tt</i>ati na sampasārīyati. None of these words are in the dictionaries.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> Vātiko, which Childers renders wrongly rheumatic. Wāta prak<i>ri</i>ti wā, says the Siɱhalese, p. 438.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> The Siɱhalese gives the different kinds of dreams seen by each of these six--the first dreams of journeys through space, the second of fire and conflagrations, the third of water, the fourth of good or bad things according as the god is kindly or malignant, the fifth of what he has himself seen or heard, and the last of his future gain or loss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> Okkante middhe; 'like a monkey's sleep,' says Hīnaṭi-kumbure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> 'Like a bird that has re-entered its nest' is Hīnaṭi-kumbure's gloss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> Appaṭivi<i>g</i>ānantassa, 'does not know the distinctions between bliss and woe (sukha dukkha vibhāga),' says the Siɱhalese, p. 440.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> Nirodha, which the Siɱhalese repeats. Probably the fourth <i>Gh</i>āna is here referred to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> Onāho pariyoniho, 'obstruction, covering.' See the Tevi<i>gg</i>a Sutta, § 58.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> Voki<i>nn</i>akaɱsaggati. 'Destroys sleep by scattered thoughts,' says the Siɱhalese, p. 441.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> It is not known whether the whole of this theory of dreams is taken from the Piṭakas, or whether it is an expansion of views there suggested. But the germs of the theory are certainly in the Piṭakas. Thus the Buddha is made at Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya I, 249, 250 to say of himself that in his midday sleep be was neither stupefied nor the contrary (neither sammūlho nor asammūlho), which comes very near to the 'monkey's sleep' referred to throughout this dilemma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> Vilīnani, wilikun wū says Hīnaṭi-kumbure (p. 442).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup> This simile has already been used above, IV, 3, 7 (I, 235).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> Gati-patibā<i>lh</i>ā, gamana bāhulyatāwen says the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> Upahat-abbhantaro, 'whose interior is burnt by the fierceness of the stomach fire' (ga<i>th</i>arāgni-gahaṇi), says Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 443.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> Hīnaṭi-kumbure had apparently a different reading (perhaps ekaɱse na vadāmi). For he translates, p. 444, 'In this death I do not say that there is one cause.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> As was noticed above on p. 112 (of the Pāli), some of these medical terms are very uncertain, and the Siɱhalese gives no help.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> Not traced in the Piṭakas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> Sāmāyiko, 'timely,' but Childers says 'temporary,' and we have had the word above (p. 22 of the Pāli) in the sense of' religious.' The Siɱhalese, p. 445, repeats the word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> Yama-visaya, 'abode of the god of death.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> Sarnāhato. Compare above, pp. 181, 254 of the Pāli, and Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya I, 337.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> Uparato, for which Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 449, has upahata wīyœyi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a>]</sup> Otaka-vitaka-ākinna. Ghaṇayawū pataḷawū ākīr<i>nn</i>awū says the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a>]</sup> Ma<i>ñ</i>garita-patte, which the Siɱhalese renders karal patra œttāwū.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> Karaka-vassaɱ is pā<i>s</i>āna-warsha in the Siɱhalese. If karaka originally meant 'hard shell,' it could have reached its ordinary meaning of 'water-pot,' from the fact that an empty half of a cocoa-nut shell is the most common form of cup.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> Vibhūtaɱ kataɱ is rendered prasiddha karaṇa laddeya in the Siɱhalese, p. 451.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> Parinibbutānaɱ. The words in brackets are Hīnaṭi-kumbure's gloss, 'Of all who have been entirely set free' is an alternative, and perhaps a better, rendering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> Mr. Trenckner prints evaɱ-nāma as qualifying <i>K</i>etiya. The Siɱhalese, p. 451, takes it as I have rendered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> These words are very ambiguous, and unfortunately the Siɱhalese (p. 452), though much expanded, is equally so. The kind of wonder referred to throughout the dilemma is also doubtful. The only one of the kind mentioned, so far as I know, in the Piṭakas is that referred to in the 'Book of the Great Decease,' V, 26, where the placing of garlands on a <i>K</i>etiya produces calm in the heart. But it is difficult to believe that our author had merely a spiritual experience of this kind in his thoughts. The whole discussion points rather to the late date at which he wrote.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a>]</sup> Theyya-saɱvāsaka. See Mahāvagga I, 69, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> Titthiya-pakkantaka, 'gone over to the Titthiyas.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n133" href="#fn133">133</a>]</sup> Garukāpatti, which Hīnaṭi-kumbure takes to be equivalent to the Saɱghādisesa offences. This is doubtless correct, and the use of the phrase in that sense is a sign of our author's later date.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> Viruddhā, 'placed in a class' (woed<u>œ</u>rum wū), says the Siɱhalese, p. 453. It is literally 'opposed,' and the idiom is curious.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a>]</sup> The words in brackets are added from the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> Similar metaphors have already been used in the 71st Dilemma (p. 283 of the Pāli) and in the 74th Dilemma (p. 295 of the Pāli).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a>]</sup> In the text the whole comparison is repeated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n138" href="#fn138">138</a>]</sup> For a similar metaphor see above, IV, 8, 31 (p. 296 of the Pāli).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n139" href="#fn139">139</a>]</sup> It is unknown what this kimi (insect, vermin, small creature) is, and it is not mentioned elsewhere. Su<i>s</i>ruta mentions a <i>s</i>ārikāmukha insect, and as in one rare word at least, which the Pāli translator did not sufficiently understand to restore to the ordinary Pāli form (kalasi for karisi, see above, I, xxiii), we find la stood in our author's dialect for ri, there may be some connection between the two. It would be particularly interesting to be able to determine the species and habitat of this creature, as it might throw some light on the district in which our author flourished.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> These measurements differ slightly from those given above, IV, 8, 14 (p. 282 of the Pāli), for a fine elephant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup> Compare the tale of the frog who wanted to swallow the bull in Æsop's fables (not yet traced in the <i>G</i>ātakas). Is the Sālaka a kind of frog, much smaller than ours?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n143" href="#fn143">143</a>]</sup> The following pages will seem only so much verbiage, and will convey no idea to a European reader, unless he realises that the Nirvāṇa discussed is of course not a salvation to be enjoyed by a 'soul' after death, and in some other world; but a state of mind to be realised and enjoyed by a man here, on this earth, in this life, and in this life only.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Though I had pointed this out already in 1876 the animistic interpretation of Nirvāṇa is still the prevalent one, and still continues to lead to endless confusion. Why is it then, the reader may ask, that our author does not contradict the Christian interpretation of the Buddhist summum bonum in so many words? Simply because it never occurred to him as possible. It was probably even as inconceivable to him as the Buddhist interpretation of it seems to be to most Western writers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> This dilemma and the next have been translated into French in the 'Revue de l'histoire des Religions' for 1885 (vol. xi, pp. 336 and following). The author's name being given as Mr. Lewis da Sylva, of Colombo, the article as it stands is presumably a translation into French, made in Paris, of Mr. da Sylva's version in English from the Siɱhalese, which may account for the fact that there is scarcely a sentence which is not misleading.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n145" href="#fn145">145</a>]</sup> In the Māgandiya Sutta, No. 75 in the Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya, where the speech will be found at I, 502.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n146" href="#fn146">146</a>]</sup> Bhūtaha<i>kk</i>e. See Mr. Trenckner's valuable note. Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 456, quotes the Pāli, reading Bhūtahu, and rendering it 'anabhiw<i>ri</i>ddhi-karaṇayek.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n147" href="#fn147">147</a>]</sup> So the Pāli (vayaɱ). But the Siɱhalese has wāsaya, 'dwelling-place,' throughout §§ 56 and 57.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n148" href="#fn148">148</a>]</sup> Atthi-dhammassa nibbānassa. The Siɱhalese, p. 459, translates 'the form, &amp;c., of the quality (dharma) of Nirvāṇa'--as if the Pāli were nibbāna-dhammassa. But see next page, note 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n149" href="#fn149">149</a>]</sup> Lokakkhāyikā, 'those who have in former days enquired into and described the world,' says the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n150" href="#fn150">150</a>]</sup> Atthidhammassa again, which Hīnaṭi-kumbure now renders œti swabhawawū. 'Pourquoi réponds-tu ainsi au sujet de l'état naturel du grand océan,' says the French. (Compare above, p. 270 of the Pāli.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n151" href="#fn151">151</a>]</sup> Arūpakāyikā. It is very odd that Hīnaṭi-kumbure takes the word here, and in the answer, as a feminine singular, and still more so that the French translation takes it throughout as a masculine singular. But the Siɱhalese throughout the sequel treats it properly as a plural nominative; and there can be little doubt that the inhabitants, or some of the inhabitants, of the 'Formless Realm,' the Arāpāva<i>k</i>ara or Arūpa-brahma-loka, are referred to. But this name is different from those given to any of these gods in Childers, and I cannot trace it in the Piṭakas as applied to any of them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n152" href="#fn152">152</a>]</sup> I follow the Pāli, which still has vayaɱ. The Siɱhalese has here and below winā<i>s</i>aya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n153" href="#fn153">153</a>]</sup> Atthisattanaɱ yeva, which the Siɱhalese, p. 460, represents merely by œttāwū.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n154" href="#fn154">154</a>]</sup> A<i>ññ</i>ehi anupavi<i>tth</i>aɱ; 'not previously explained by others,' says Hīnaṭi-kumbure. Neither rendering is altogether satisfactory. Perhaps 'of which you have been convinced by others,' in agreement with the use of the word above, p. 270 of the Pāli.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n155" href="#fn155">155</a>]</sup> In the French of Mr. da Sylva this sentence runs (p. 342): 'Mais vénérable, n'y a-t-il pas une vertu du Nirvāṇa dont on puisse percevoir quelque ressemblance.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n157" href="#fn157">157</a>]</sup> On these fundamental conceptions see my notes in 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 148, 149, where it is shown that the' three cravings' which end in Nirvāṇa are pretty much the same as the lust of the flesh, theism, and materialism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n158" href="#fn158">158</a>]</sup> Amata, the translation of which word by 'immortality' has given rise to so much confusion. So the French here says 'la médecine a le pouvoir de combattre la mort,' which is nearly as bad. See the Appendix.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n159" href="#fn159">159</a>]</sup> See on this belief above, IV, 3, 39 (I, 269).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n160" href="#fn160">160</a>]</sup> The word used here for free, empty (su<i>ññ</i>a), has again given rise to the most odd misconceptions. As Nirvāṇa is hence called Sunyatā, 'emptiness,' Christian writers (taking Nirvāṇa as a name for some kind of future life) have very naturally thought, in trying to fasten some meaning upon emptiness in a future life, that it must mean 'annihilation of a soul,' and have labelled Buddhism as Nihilism! The real meaning is really very simple, and entirely ethical (not metaphysical or animistic):</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'Men may rise on stepping stones<br />
					Of their dead selves to higher things.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">See below, IV, 8, 78, for a metaphor founded on a similar idea.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n161" href="#fn161">161</a>]</sup> Saɱkusumito, only found here. Compare 'garlands, vitvam,' 175, 176.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup> Anissitaɱ, so below, p. 351 of the Pāli, the dhutaṅgaɱ is said to be anissitaɱ. The translation is difficult. In our passage here Hīnaṭi-kumbure (p. 464) renders it, as applied both to space and to Nirvāṇa, by 'having no ā<i>s</i>rawa.' Below, as applied to the vows (dhutaṅgas), he renders it (p. 512) by 'unconnected with craving' (t<i>ri</i>shṇāni<i>s</i>rita). 'Self-dependent' or 'untarnished (by reliance on external things') would suit the context in all three passages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n163" href="#fn163">163</a>]</sup> This is butter made of buffaloes' milk, and is highly esteemed in India.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n164" href="#fn164">164</a>]</sup> Not yet traced in the Piṭakas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup> 'By the action of Karma as a pre-existing cause' is to be understood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n166" href="#fn166">166</a>]</sup> Bhind'etaɱ anto-dosa-sallaɱ; break and take away the dart of the guilt (dosa) of that doubt which has arisen in my inmost being (satana),' says Hīnaṭi-kumbure. It is literally 'break this dart of guilt within.' The meaning is clear enough (except as to whether the guilt is the speaker's or 'this people's'). To break a dart in a wound would be no kindness, and that cannot have been the author's idea. To bring out the meaning one must amplify a little, and I should have followed the Siɱhalese had it not seemed preferable to leave the personality of the guilty one as ambiguous in the translation as in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup> Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 467, does actually put these words into Nāgasena's mouth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup> Sītalato, literally 'by cold.' See the note above on III, 6, 6 (I, 119).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup> Rāga, dosa, moha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup> Compare above, IV, 8, 69, and the note there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup> The words in brackets are added from the Siɱhalese, p. 467.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n172" href="#fn172">172</a>]</sup> So also at <i>G</i>ātaka IV, 222 (verse 48).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n173" href="#fn173">173</a>]</sup> Saɱkhārānaɱ parattaɱ sammasati. Compare Dhammapada, verse 374.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n174" href="#fn174">174</a>]</sup> Gayhūpagam; so the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n175" href="#fn175">175</a>]</sup> Divasa-santatta. So Hīnaṭi-kumbure, and compare Ma<i>ggh</i>ima Nikāya I, 4 5 3, and <i>G</i>ātaka IV, 118 (where the reading is diva-santatta). See also above, p. 46 of the Pāli.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n176" href="#fn176">176</a>]</sup> For ḍāho okkamati, Hīnaṭi-kumbure may have had a different reading. He renders ḍahadiya selawenneya, 'sweat shapes' (sic for forms').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n177" href="#fn177">177</a>]</sup> Bhavesu; literally 'of becomings' ('in any of the three worlds,' adds the Siɱhalese).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n178" href="#fn178">178</a>]</sup> Pavatte. I have included Hīnaṭi-kumbure's explanation of this word, for which there is no equivalent in English.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n179" href="#fn17">179</a>]</sup> Saɱkhāra, saɱkhāra-dharmayange says the Siɱhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n180" href="#fn180">180</a>]</sup> Upadhi; the Siɱhalese (p. 470) has simply kle<i>s</i>ayan.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n181" href="#fn181">181</a>]</sup> Pahaɱsīyati kuhūyati, both words only found here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n182" href="#fn182">182</a>]</sup> Appavattam okkamati, Apraw<i>ri</i>ttiya yayi kiyana lada Arhat-phalayaṭa pœmiṇenneya, says Hīnaṭi-kumbure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n183" href="#fn183">183</a>]</sup> This paragraph is an excellent example of the difficulty of doing anything like justice in translations to the most instructive and valuable passages in our Buddhist texts. It is in the Pāli full of eloquence, and even in the Siɱhalese, though there too much expanded, it is powerful and striking. To a Buddhist it must have been inspiring and touching to the last degree, carefully led up to, as it is, with masterly skill, by our author. But it is so full of terms untranslatable into English, and with difficulty even comprehensible to minds saturated with Western ideas, that every translation must be inadequate, and any attempt to reproduce the real beauty of its style must be a failure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n184" href="#fn184">184</a>]</sup> How almost impossible it is for a reader with pre-conceived delusions to grasp the plain sense of such passages may be seen from the strange note which the French translator has added at the end of this clear and eloquent description. He says, 'La conclusion de ce Jātaka (sic!) paraīt etre que le dévot bouddhiste peut atteindre Nirvāna dans cette vie meme. Il est fācheux que l'auteur ne se soit pas expliqué plus catégoriquement sur cette question intéressante' (!).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n185" href="#fn185">185</a>]</sup> Sannihitaɱ perhaps 'is situate.' Hīnaṭi-kumbure has pihiṭiye, 'can be got.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n186" href="#fn186">186</a>]</sup> I<i>kkh</i>itabbo. See above, p. 269 of the Pāli.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n187" href="#fn187">187</a>]</sup> This is stated in regard to each of the seven in the standard passage on these seven treasures, translated in my 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 251-259.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n188" href="#fn188">188</a>]</sup> Sakā. Hīnaṭi-kumbure has sadly blundered over this, to him, strange word. He actually translates it 'one's own.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n189" href="#fn189">189</a>]</sup> Vilāta, the Siɱhalese has Milāta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n190" href="#fn190">190</a>]</sup> That is Alexandria on the Indus. See the Introduction to the first part, p. xxiii.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n191" href="#fn191">191</a>]</sup> All these names are discussed, ibid. pp. xliii, xliv.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n192" href="#fn192">192</a>]</sup> Naga-muddham. Hīnaṭi-kumbure understands this as the top of Mount Meru, Sakka's heaven.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n193" href="#fn193">193</a>]</sup> Brahma-loke.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n194" href="#fn194">194</a>]</sup> In the Siɱhalese, pp. 472, 473, this last paragraph is much expanded.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n195" href="#fn195">195</a>]</sup> The Siɱhalese has Sakala-<i>g</i>ana-mano-nandanīyawū me Srī-saddharmādāsayehi aṭaweni wargaya nimiyeya.</p>
