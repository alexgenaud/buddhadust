					<h4 class="ctr c">THE PROBLEM OF INFERENCE</h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>1. Now Milinda the king went up to the place where Nāgasena was, and bowed down before him, and took his seat on one side. And when so seated he, longing to know, to hear, and to remember, and longing to make the light of knowledge arise and to break in pieces his ignorance, roused up in himself courage and zeal, and, full of self-possession and thoughtfulness, spake thus to Nāgasena:</p>

					<p>2. 'Venerable Nāgasena, tell me, have you ever seen the Buddha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p>'No, O king.'</p>

					<p>'Then have your teachers ever seen the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'No, Sire.'</p>

					<p>'So you say, venerable Nāgasena, that you have never seen the Buddha, and that your teachers have never seen the Buddha. Therefore, Nāgasena, the Buddha did not exist. There is no clear evidence, in that case, of a Buddha.'</p>

					<p>'But did those Kshatriyas of old exist, who were the founders of the line of kings from which you come?'</p>

					<p>'Certainly, Sir. How can there be any doubt about that?'</p>

					<p>'Well, O king. Have you ever seen them?'</p>

					<p>'No, Sir.'</p>

					<p><a id="pg207"><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span></a> 'And those who instructed you -- the family chaplains, and officers of the staff, and those who lay down the law, and ministers of state -- have they ever seen those Kshatriyas of old?'</p>

					<p>'No, Sir.'</p>

					<p>'If then neither have you seen them, nor your teachers, where are they? There is no clear evidence, in that case, of those Kshatriyas of old!'</p>

					<p>3. 'But, Nāgasena, the royal insignia they used are still to be seen -- the white sunshade of state, and the crown, and the slippers, and the fan with the yak's tail, and the sword of state, and the priceless throne -- and by these can we know and believe that the Kshatriyas of old lived once.'</p>

					<p>'Just so, O king, can we know that Blessed One and believe in him. For there is a reason for our knowledge and belief that the Blessed One was. And what is that reason?--The royal insignia used by that Blessed One, by him of knowledge and insight, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme, are still to be seen-the four Means of keeping oneself ready and mindful, and the fourfold Great Struggle, and the four steps to Iddhi, and the five Organs of the moral sense, and the five moral Powers, and the seven forms of the wisdom of the Arahats, and the Noble Eightfold Path<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> -- and by these can the whole <a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> world of gods and men know and believe that that Blessed One existed once. By this reason, on this ground, by this argument, through this inference, can it be known that the Blessed One lived.</p>

					<p>He who, himself set free in that bless'd state<br />
					In which the Upadhis have ceased to be,<br />
					 -- Lusts, sin, and Karma, -- has brought safe ashore,<br />
					Saved from the sea of woe, great multitudes--<br />
					Only by inference can it be known<br />
					That he, the best of men, existed once."'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>4. 'Venerable Nāgasena, give me an illustration.'</p>

					<p>'Just, O king, as the architect of a City,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> when he wants to build one, would first search out a pleasant spot of ground, with which no fault can be found, even, with no hills or gullies in it, free from rough ground and rocks, not open to the danger of attack. And then, when he has made plain any rough places there may still be on it, he would clear it thoroughly of all stumps and stakes, and would proceed to build there a city fine and regular, measured out into suitable quarters,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> with trenches and ramparts thrown up around it,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> with strong gateways, watch-towers, and battlements, with wide squares and open places and junctions (where two roads meet) and cross-ways (where four <a id="pg209"><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span></a> roads meet),<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> with cleanly and even high roads,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> with regular lines of open shops (bazaars), well provided with parks, and gardens, and lakes, and lotus-ponds, and wells, adorned with many kinds of temples to the gods, free from every fault. And then when the city stood there in all its glory, he would go away to some other land. And in course of time that city might become mighty and prosperous, filled with stores of food, peaceful, glorious, happy, free from distress and calamity, the meeting-place of all sorts and conditions of men. Then nobles and brahmans, merchants and work-people; soldiers mounted on elephants, and on horses, and on chariots; infantry, and bowmen, and swordsmen; standard-bearers, officers, and camp-followers;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> highborn warriors whose delight is in war, fighting champions, men mighty as elephants, heroes, men who fight in buckskin,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> devoted fighting-men born of slaves in great houses or of the privates in the royal army;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> troops of professional wrestlers;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg210"><span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span></a> cooks and curry makers, barbers and bathing attendants, smiths and florists, workers in gold and silver and lead and tin and copper and brass<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> and iron, and jewellers; messengers; potters, salt gatherers,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> tanners, carriage builders, carvers in ivory,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> rope makers, comb makers, cotton-thread spinners, basket makers, bow manufacturers, bowstring makers, arrow fletchers, painters, dye manufacturers, dyers, weavers, tailors, assayers of gold,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> cloth merchants,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> dealers in perfumes, grass cutters, hewers of wood, hired servants,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> people who live by gathering flowers and fruits and roots in the woods, hawkers of boiled rice, sellers of cakes, fishmongers, butchers, dealers in strong drinks, play actors, dancers, acrobats,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> conjurors, professional bards,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> wrestlers <a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> (boxers), corpse burners, casters out of rotten flowers,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> savages,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> wild men of the woods,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> prostitutes, swingers and jumpers,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span> and the slave girls of bullies -- people of many countries, people from Scythia, Bactria, China, and Vilāta; people of U<i>gg</i>eni, of Bhāruka<i>kkh</i>a, of Benares, of Kosala, and of the border lands; people from Magadha, and Sāketa, and Sura<i>tth</i>a, and the West; from Koṭumbara and Madhura, from Alexandria, Kashmīr, and Gandhāra,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span> -- all these coming to take up their residence there, and finding the new city to be regular, faultless, perfect, and pleasant, would know: "Able indeed must that architect have been by whom this city was built!"</p>

					<p>5. 'Just so, O king that Blessed One, peerless, unequalled, unapproached, incomparable, admirable beyond all measure by weight or calculation, of infinite virtue, full of virtue and perfection, boundless in wisdom and glory and zeal and power, who, when he had attained to the summit of all the perfections <a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a> of the Buddhas, overthrew Māra and all his hosts, -- he, bursting asunder the net of heresy, and casting aside ignorance, and causing wisdom to arise, and bearing aloft the torch of Truth, reached forward to Buddhahood itself, and so, unconquered and unconquerable in the fight, built this city of Righteousness. And the Blessed One's City of Righteousness, O king, has righteousness for its rampart, and fear of sin for its moat, and knowledge for the battlement over its city gate, and zeal for the watch-tower above that, and faith for the pillars at its base, and mindfulness for the watchman at the gate, and wisdom for the terrace above, and the Suttantas for its market-place, and the Abhidhamma for its cross-ways, and the Vinaya (the Canon Law) for its judgment hall, and constant self-possession for its chief street. And in that street, O king, these bazaars are open--a flower bazaar, and a fruit bazaar, and an antidote bazaar, and a medicine bazaar, and an ambrosia bazaar, and a bazaar for precious stones, and a bazaar for all manner of merchandise.'</p>

					<p>6. 'But what, venerable Nāgasena, is the flower bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'There are certain subjects for meditation, O king, that have been made known by the Blessed One, by him of knowledge and insight, by the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme. And they are these. The idea of the impermanence (of every thing and of every being), the idea of the absence of any abiding principle (any soul in any thing or any being), the idea of the impurity and the idea of the danger connected with the body, the idea of getting rid of evil dispositions, the idea of freedom from passion, the idea of peace, the idea of dissatisfaction with the <a id="pg213"><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></a> things of the world, the idea of the transitory nature of all conditions, the idea of ecstatic trance, the ideas of a corpse in the various stages of decay, the ideas of a place of execution in all its various horrors, the idea of love to all beings, the idea of pity for all beings, the idea of sympathy with all beings, the idea of equanimity in all the changing circumstances of life, the idea of death, and the idea of the body.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> These, O king, are the subjects for meditation prescribed by the Blessed One. And of these, whoever, longing to be delivered from old age and death, takes any one as the subject of his meditation, by that meditation does he become set free from passion, set free from malice, set free from dullness, set free from pride, set free from wrong views, by that does he cross the ocean of Saṃsāra, and stem the torrent of cravings, and cleanse himself of the threefold stain,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> and destroy within himself all evil; and so, entering that glorious city, spotless and stainless, pure and white, ageless and deathless, where all is security and calm and bliss--the city of Nirvāṇa--he emancipates his mind in Arahatship! And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of flowers."</p>

					<p>"Take with you Karma as the price,<br />
					And go ye up to that bazaar,<br />
					Buy there an object for your thought,<br />
					Emancipate yourselves. Be free!"'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg214"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></a> 7. 'And what, venerable Nāgasena, is the perfume bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'There are certain categories of virtue, O king, that have been made known by the Blessed One, and anointed by the perfume of that righteousness the children of the Blessed One fill with the fumes of the fragrant incense of the perfume of goodness the whole world of gods and men, in every direction, and to windward and to leeward, continuing to pervade it again and yet again. And which are those categories? The virtue of taking refuge,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> the virtue that is fivefold and eightfold and tenfold<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span>, and the virtue of self-restraint tabulated in the five recitations that compose the Pātimokkha.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of perfumes." For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>

					<p>"No flower's scent can go against the wind,<br />
					Not sandal wood's, nor musk's, nor jasmine flower's:<br />
					But the sweet perfume of the good doth go<br />
					Against the wind, and the good man pervades,<br />
					On every side, the sweetness of his life."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>"Red sandal wood, musk, and the lotus, and jasmine --<br />
					The perfume of goodness surpasseth them all.<br />
					Abundant the sweet scent of musk and of sandal wood --<br />
					Still stronger, the scent of the good mounts to heaven!"'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>8. 'And what, venerable Nāgasena, is the fruit bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'Certain fruits have been made known, O king, by the Blessed One. And they are these:--The fruit of the first stage of the Excellent Way (conversion), <a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> and of the second stage, and of the third stage, and of the fourth (Arahatship),<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span> -- the fruit of the attainment of emptiness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> -- the fruit of the attainment of the absence of the three signs (of an unconverted life, lust, malice, and dullness) -- and the truth of the attainment of that state in which no low aspirations survive. [<b>334</b>] And whosoever desires any one of these, he gives his Karma as the price, and buys the fruit he longs for--either conversion or any other.</p>

					<p>9. 'Just, O king, as any man who has a mango-tree bearing fruit all the year round, he does not knock down the fruits until buyers come. But when a buyer has come, and the fruit-grower has taken the price, then he says: "Come, my good man, this tree is always in bearing (it has therefore fruits in all stages of growth), take from it the kind of fruit you prefer, whether unripe, or decayed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span> or hairy,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> or sour, or ripe."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> And the buyer, for the price paid, takes the kind he likes the best-if that be unripe fruit then he takes that, if it be decayed fruit then that, if it be hairy fruit then that, if it be sour fruit then that, if it be ripe fruit then he takes a ripe one. Just so, O king, whosoever desires any one of those other fruits, he gives his Karma as the price, and buys the fruit he longs for -- <a id="pg217"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span></a> either conversion or any other. And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of fruits."</p>

					<p>"Men give their Karma as the price,<br />
					And buy the fruit ambrosia;<br />
					And happiness is theirs, and peace,<br />
					Who've bought the fruit ambrosia."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>10. 'And what, venerable Nāgasena, is the antidote bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'Certain drugs, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One; drugs by which the Blessed One delivers the whole world of gods and men from the poison of evil dispositions. And what are these drugs? The four Noble Truths made known by the Blessed One, that is to say, the truth as to sorrow, and the truth as to the origin of sorrow, and the truth as to the cessation of sorrow, and the truth as to that path which leads to the cessation of sorrow.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span> And whosoever, longing for the highest insight (the insight of Arahatship),<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> hear this doctrine of the four truths, they are set quite free from rebirth, they are set quite free from old age, they are set quite free from death, they are set quite free from grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair. And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of antidotes."</p>

					<p><a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> "Of all the drugs, in all the world,<br />
					The antidotes of poison dire,<br />
					Not one equals that Doctrine sweet.<br />
					Drink that, O brethren. Drink and live!"'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>11. 'And what, venerable Nāgasena, is the medicine bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'Certain medicines, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One, medicines by which he cures the whole world of gods and men. And they are these:--"The four Means of keeping oneself ready and mindful, and the fourfold Great Struggle, and the four Steps to Iddhi, and the five Organs of the moral sense, and the five moral Powers, and the seven Forms of the Wisdom of the Arahats, and the Noble Eightfold Path."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span> By these medicines the Blessed One purges men of wrong views, purges them of low aspirations, purges them of evil speaking, purges them of evil deeds, purges them of evil modes of livelihood, purges them of wrong endeavours, purges them of evil thoughts, purges them of erroneous meditation; and he gives emetics to the vomiting up of lusts, and of malice, and of dullness, and of doubt, and of self-righteousness, and of sloth of body and inertness of mind, and of shamelessness and hardness of heart, and of all evil. And this, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's bazaar of medicine."</p>

					<p>Of all the medicines found in all the world,<br />
					Many in number, various in their powers,<br />
					Not one equals this medicine of the Truth.<br />
					Drink that, O brethren. Drink, and drinking, live!</p>

					<p><a id="pg219"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> For having drunk that medicine of the Truth,<br />
					Ye shall have past beyond old age and death,<br />
					And--evil, lusts, and Karma rooted out --<br />
					Thoughtful and seeing, ye shall be at rest!"'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>12. 'And what, venerable Nāgasena, is the ambrosia bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'An ambrosia, O king, has been made known by the Blessed One, that ambrosia with which he besprinkles the whole world of gods and men--as men anoint a king on his coronation day -- and men and gods, when sprinkled with that ambrosia, are set free from rebirths, old age, disease, and death, from grief, and lamentation, and pain, and sorrow, and despair. And what is that ambrosia? That meditation which consists in active attention to, and leads to a true grasp of, the real conditions of corporeal things.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span> For it has been said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>

					<p>"They, O brethren, feed on ambrosia who feed on active attention directed to corporeal things."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span> This, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's ambrosia bazaar."</p>

					<p><a id="pg220"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></a> "He saw mankind afflicted with disease,<br />
					He opened freely his ambrosia shop;<br />
					Go, then, O brethren, give your Karma for it,<br />
					And buy, and feed on, that ambrosial food."'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>13. 'And what, venerable Nāgasena, is the jewel bazaar of the Blessed One, the Buddha?'</p>

					<p>'Certain jewels, O king, have been made known by the Blessed One, and adorned with those jewels the children of the Blessed One shine forth in splendour, illuminating the whole world of gods and men, brightening it in its heights, in its depths, from horizon to horizon, with a brilliant glory. And those jewels are these--the jewel of right conduct, and the jewel of meditation, and the jewel of knowledge, and the jewel of emancipation, and the jewel of the insight which arises from the assurance of emancipation, and the jewel of discrimination, and the jewel of the sevenfold wisdom of the Arahats.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>14. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of right conduct?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span> The right conduct which follows on self-restraint according to the rules of the Pātimokkha, the right conduct which follows on <a id="pg221"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span></a> restraint of the bodily organs and the mind,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span> the right conduct which results from a pure means of livelihood, the right conduct in relation to the four requisites of a recluse,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn51" href="#n51">51</a>]</sup></span> the right conduct presented in the Short, and Middle, and Long Summonses,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn52" href="#n52">52</a>]</sup></span> the right conduct of those who are walking in the Path, and the right conduct of those who have attained each of the various fruits thereof (beginning at conversion and ending at Arahatship).<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn53" href="#n53">53</a>]</sup></span> And all the beings in the world, O king, gods<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span> and men, and the Māras too (the spirits of evil), and the Brahmas (the very highest of the gods), and Samanas and Brahmans are filled with longing and desire for a man who wears, as his ornament, this jewel of right conduct. And the Bhikkhu, O king, who puts it on shines forth in glory all around, upwards and downwards, and from side to side, surpassing in lustre all the jewels to be found from the Waveless Deep,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span> below to the highest heavens above, excelling them all, overwhelming them all. Such, O king, are the jewels of right conduct set out for sale in the Blessed One's bazaar of gems. And this is what is called "The Blessed One's jewel of righteousness."</p>

					<p><a id="pg222"><span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span></a> "Such are the virtues sold in that bazaar,<br />
					The shop of the Enlightened One,<br />
					the Blest; Pay Karma as the price, O ye ill-clad!<br />
					Buy, and put on, these lustrous Buddha-gems!"</p>

					<p>15. 'And what, O king, is the Blessed One's jewel of meditation? The meditation that consists of specific conceptions, and of investigation regarding them;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span> -- the meditation that consists of reflection only, specific conceptions being lost sight of;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn57" href="#n57">57</a>]</sup></span> -- the meditation that continues after specific conceptions and reflection on them have both ceased;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn58" href="#n58">58</a>]</sup></span> -- the meditation that is void (of lusts, evil dispositions, and Karma); -- the meditation from which three signs (of an unconverted life-lust, malice, and dullness) are absent;--the meditation in which no low aspirations remain.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn59" href="#n59">59</a>]</sup></span> And when a Bhikkhu, O king, has put on this jewel of meditation (Samādhi), then ideas of lust, and ideas of anger, and ideas of cruelty, and all the various bad thoughts that have their basis in the evil dispositions of pride, self-righteousness, adhesion to wrong views, and doubt--all these, since they come into contact with meditation, flow off from him, disperse, and are dispelled, they stay not with him, adhere not to him. just, O king, as when water has fallen on a lotus leaf it flows off from it, is dispersed and scattered <a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> away, stays not on it, adheres not to it<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn60" href="#n60">60</a>]</sup></span> -- so when a Bhikkhu has put on this jewel of meditation, then ideas of lust, and ideas of anger, and ideas of cruelty, and all the various bad thoughts that have their basis in the evil dispositions of pride, self-righteousness, obstinacy in wrong views, and doubt--these all, as soon as they come in contact with meditation, flow off, disperse, and are dispelled, stay not with him, adhere not to him. And why not? Because of the exceeding purity of the habit of meditation. This, O king, is what is called "The Blessed One's jewel of meditation," and such are the jewels of meditation set out for sale in the Blessed One's bazaar of gems.</p>

					<p>"Bad thoughts can ne'er arise beneath the brow<br />
					Encircled by this coronet of gems.<br />
					It charms away perplexed and wandering thought.<br />

And I now, a garland maker, as it were in the <a id="pg243"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span></a> church of the Conqueror, stringing those flowers together,--both following the path of our teachers of old, and also using such power of wisdom as in me is,--could show forth by inference the power of the Buddha in innumerable similes.

They formed the subject of the last discourse delivered by Gotama before his death to his disciples ('Book of the Great Decease,' III, 61), and on my translation of that passage ('Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 60-63) I have added a note giving all the details.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is perhaps worthy of remark that both here and twice else where, at pp. 37, 335 (of the Pāli), our author reverses the order of Nos. 4 and 5--the five moral Powers and the five Organs (of the higher sense)--which are really only the same mental qualities looked at from two different points of view.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> This stanza has not yet been found in the Piṭakas. In the first line it does not seem quite clear at first sight why Karma, of all things, should be the price. That Indian word being too full of meaning to be translateable, is necessarily retained, and hence the phrase 'taking Karma as the price' may convey no meaning at all. If so, in trying to escape Scylla the unhappy translator has fallen into Charybdis. But it must mean one of two things, either something to be abandoned, given up; or something good which the buyer possesses, and may exchange for the good he wants to buy. If our author means the first it must be Karma (as one of the Upadhis), as a basis for continued individuality, and be much the same as egoism. If he means the other, then Karma, though standing alone, must be here used in the sense of kusala-kamma, good Karma, that is, the effect of good deeds done in a former life. Now our author never elsewhere uses kamma, without any qualifying adjective, in the sense of good Karma. On pp. 7, 20, 67, 108 foll., 134, 151, 189, 302 of the Pāli the unqualified word means throughout bad Karma, the effect of bad deeds done in a former birth. In a few passages it is used of former deeds in a way that apparently includes both good and bad. See especially pp. 3, 10, 146, 268. Now a buyer, in the case put, could not give up either the bad or the good deeds he had already done in a former life--that would be beyond his power. He could only offer, in exchange for the good he wanted to buy, good Karma (that is, in the sense of good deeds) either in the present, or in the immediate future. Below, V, 21 (p. 341 of the Pāli), will be found instances given by our author himself. It is forced, no doubt, to call this 'a price,' but it is probably the sense intended, and so Hīnaṭi-kumbure takes it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> It will be noticed that Nāgasena is here really going an inch beyond his text. In that text (which has not been traced) amata, ambrosia, means no doubt as elsewhere, the ambrosia of Nirvāṇa. And the text does not say that the active attention and the ambrosia are the same, but only that they who feed on the one feed also on the other. Even if we translate 'are feeding' instead of 'feed' (which is grammatically possible) a similar argument would hold good. But though it is impossible to say for certain, without knowing the context of the passage, the rendering above is more in accord with Pāli usage, and more likely therefore to be right.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Not traced as yet. All these stanzas seem to belong together, and will doubtless be found in the same Sutta or poem.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> What we have here are the two higher stages of the three into which Buddhist ethics naturally falls. The morality of laymen has been included above, V, 7, where it already passes over into that of the ordinary, unconverted member of the Order. Here we begin with that, starting with the last item of the previous list, and go on, through the sīlas, to the highest ethics of Arahatship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> The devas, those gods dwelling in Sakka's heaven, and, I think, the devatās also (fairies, nyads, dryads, &amp;c.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Apparently the passage over from the first to the second <i>Gh</i>āna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> But insight, and the resulting bliss, remain. Compare above, II, 2, 3 (I, 67).</p>

This verse is quoted at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 13, verse 51, and the word is there spelt salaḷa. The Siṃhalese has salala, and the Sanskrit lexicons have sarala. Clough identifies it, no doubt wrongly, with the last, the Anglo-Indian Hal tree, which the botanists call the Shorea robusta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Yūthikā; sīnidda, says Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 492, and Clough thinks this is oleander. But Böhtlingk-Roth say a sort of jasmine, Jasminum auriculatum.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Yohombu in the Siṃhalese. Clough says this is a creeper called Borago Zeylanica. But does that grow in the North-West of India? According to Böhtlingk-Roth, Atimuttaka is the name of three plants, one of which is the Gaertnera Racemosa, much cultivated for the beauty and perfume of its flowers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> The last four are the Pāṭalī, Uppala, Vassika, and Mallikā, all of which are well known.

That is, in looking back over the course he has followed along the Excellent Way, he becomes conscious of having got beyond each of the obstacles (the Saṃyo<i>g</i>anas) that can beset him. It is the doctrine of 'final assurance' from the Buddhist point of view. Compare <i>ñ</i>āṇadassana at Dīgha II, 83.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> 1 Paṭisambhidā. Hīnaṭi-kumbure merely repeats the ambiguous technical terms of the Pāli. Childers, sub voce, gives the various interpretations of other authorities. Compare above, I, 29, 34) 36. The third and fourth seem to me to be doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> Pa<i>ñk</i>āvudho; literally 'with the five weapons on.' The expression is not infrequent; compare pa<i>ñk</i>āvudha-sannaddha, used of a hunter, at <i>G</i>ātaka III, 467; IV, 283, 437; and sannaddha-pa<i>ñk</i>āvudhā, used of sailors fighting, at <i>G</i>ātaka IV, 160. But it is quite possible that weapons different from those here described are there meant, as they are not suited, for instance, to the hunter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> Hīnaṭi-kumbure translates this weapon (ma<i>nd</i>alagga) simply by kaḍuwa, sword; but 'bent blade' must mean a sabre.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> <i>Kh</i>urikā. Childers has only 'knife.' The Siṃhalese, p. 493, has kirisaya, which is not in Clough, but is doubtless the Malay kreese. These five weapons are not mentioned elsewhere, and as three of the five words are rare, are probably those in special use in the country where our author lived. In this respect it is noteworthy that the Sanskrit kshurikā is only mentioned, according to Böhtlingk-Roth, in the Rā<i>g</i>a Taraṇginī of Kashmir, and in the title of a late Upanishad. We shall therefore scarcely go far wrong if we understand by our author's <i>kh</i>urikā the famous Afghan knife.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> Arthayen arthaya gaḷapā, &amp;c., says the Siṃhalese. He will reply by adducing parallel passages, much in the style of modern scholarship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> He gives the principal ones, as set out in his previous arguments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> Nirutti. Hīnaṭi-kumbure unfortunately simply repeats all these technical terms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> Lakkhana. As for instance above, I. 51-62.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> Phaseyya; literally 'he who having bought paṭisambhidā shall touch it with his <i>ñ</i>āṇa.' The Siṃhalese, p. 494, has spar<i>s</i>akoṭa, which does not help us.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> The Siṃhalese again only repeats these seven technical terms, except the second Dhamma-vi<i>k</i>aya, which it renders by pra<i>gñ</i>ā.</p>
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> Bodhi. Childers says, 'the supreme knowledge of a Buddha.' But this is wrong, as is evident even from the context here. The whole exposition is of Arahatship, not Buddhahood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> Hīnaṭi-kumbure, characteristically enough for a Ceylon man, adds, 'and the Footprint and the Bo-tree.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> The first line only of these verses is in the Saṃyutta III, 2, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> Vipassakā, not necessarily the insight of the Arahats, as Childers says. We have seen Vipassanā ascribed above, p. 16 (of the Pāli), to a Sotāpanno.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> That is the fall of beings from one state of existence--their death in that state in other words--and their rise, their rebirth, in another.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> <i>G</i>otaka, as a city official, is something akin to torchbearer, lamplighter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> These are six out of the ten divisions of Vya<i>ñg</i>ana-vuddhi, mentioned in the verse at Sumaṇgala Vilāsinī I, 177. Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 501, merely repeats the words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> Dhamma-rakkhā, 'dharmikawū āraksha-grahaṇayehi niyuktawū' in the Siṃhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> Nidāna-pa<i>th</i>ana-kusalā; 'Āpatti geṇa hœra dœkwīmehi dakshawū,' says the Siṃhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> One word, vu<i>tth</i>āna, is here doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n101" href="#fn101">101</a>]</sup> See Mahāvagga IX, 4, 9. 10, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> Literally 'skilled in form, shape, beauty.' The Siṃhalese repeats this ambiguous expression, adding the qualification amātyayo, 'ministers, officials.' One would think that these would have been the judges, but our author has already made the Arahats the judges in his Dhamma-nagara. This only leaves him some minor official post to give away to those learned in Canon Law, and he has chosen one as unintelligible in Ceylon as it is to me.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> Paṭipannā, which Hīnaṭi-kumbure takes here to mean Arahats, but see the note above, V, 20 (p. 341 of the Pāli).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> Abhidhamme abhivinaye. A phrase very instructive as to the correct rendering of the much misunderstood word abhidhamma. As I pointed out already in the 'Hibbert Lectures' for 1881, it is a blunder to translate it, as is usually done, by 'metaphysics.' The whole context is taken from the Sangīti Sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> 'The ambrosia of the Saddharma,' says Hīnaṭi-kumbure, p. 502.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> Dhammāpaṇikā. The Siṃhalese has Dhārmikāpaṇikayo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Dhamma-se<i>tth</i>ino, which the Siṃhalese repeats.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> Adhisīla, adhi<i>k</i>itta, and adhipaññā, says Hīnaṭi-kumbure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> It is perhaps such poetical figures as this that have afforded foundation for the legend of Buddha's footprint.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> The Siṃhalese is here much expanded.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> Mr. Trenckner reads 'Anumāna pa<i>ñ</i>haṃ,' the Siṃhalese has 'Mahā Anumāna Pra<i>s</i>nayayi.'</p>
