					The Talk on Awakening</h4>

					<p class="f4">1. At one time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the awakened one, the Lord, being recently fully awakened, was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjarā at the foot of the Tree of Awakening.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Then the Lord sat cross-legged in one (posture)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> for seven days at the foot of the Tree of Awakening<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> experiencing the bliss of freedom.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then the Lord during the first watch of the night paid attention to<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> causal uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> are the habitual tendencies<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>; conditioned by consciousness is psycho-physicality<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>; conditioned by psycho-physicality are the six (sense-) spheres; conditioned by the six (sense-) spheres is awareness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>; conditioned by awareness is feeling; conditioned by feeling<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> is craving; conditioned by craving is grasping; conditioned by grasping is becoming; conditioned by becoming is birth; conditioned by birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and despair come into being. <a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> Such is the arising of this entire mass of ill. But from the utter fading away and stopping of this very ignorance (comes) the stopping of habitual tendencies; from the stopping of habitual tendencies the stopping of consciousness; from the stopping of consciousness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> the stopping of psycho-physicality; from the stopping of psycho-physicality the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres; from the stopping of the six (sense-) spheres the stopping of awareness; from the stopping of awareness the stopping of feeling; from the stopping of feeling the stopping of craving; from the stopping of craving the stopping of grasping; from the stopping of grasping the stopping of becoming; from the stopping of becoming the stopping of birth; from the stopping of birth, old age and dying, grief, sorrow and lamentation, suffering, dejection and despair are stopped. Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Truly, when things<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> grow plain to the ardent meditating Brahmān,<br />
							His doubts all vanish in that he comprehends thing-with-cause."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Then the Lord during the middle watch of the night paid attention to causal uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual tendencies; con- ditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness ... Such is the arising ... Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Truly, when things grow plain to the ardent meditating Brahmān,<br />
							His doubts all vanish in that he discerns destruction of cause."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> 6. Then the Lord during the last watch of the night paid attention to causal uprising in direct and reverse order: conditioned by ignorance are the habitual tendencies; conditioned by the habitual tendencies is consciousness ... Such is the arising ... Such is the stopping of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Truly, when things grow plain to the ardent meditating Brahmān, Routing the host of Māra does he stand<br />
							Like as the sun when lighting up the sky."</p>

					The Talk at the Goatherds Banyan</h4>

					<p class="f4">1. Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days, approached the Goatherds' Banyan<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> from the foot of the Tree of Awakening; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Goatherds' Banyan experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then a certain Brahmān of the class uttering the sound <i>huṃ</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, that Brahmān spoke thus to the Lord: "To what extent, good Gotama, does one become a Brahmān? And again, what are the things which make a Brahmān?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a> "That Brahmān who bars out evil things, not uttering the sound <i>hum</i>,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> with no impurity, curbed-of-self,<br />
							Master of Vedas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> who lives the Brahma-faring — this is the Brahmān who may rightly speak the Brahmā-speech<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Who has no blemishes<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> anywhere in the world."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					The Talk at the Mucalinda Tree</h4>

					<p class="f4">1. Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that contemplation, approached the Mucalinda (tree) from the foot of the Goatherds' Banyan; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Mucalinda experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span> a great storm arose out of due season, for seven days there was rainy weather, cold winds and overcast skies. Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, having come forth from his own haunt, having encircled the Lord's body seven times with his coils, having spread a great hood over his head, stood saying: "Let no cold (annoy) the Lord, let no heat (annoy) the Lord, let not the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and heat or creeping things (annoy) the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then Mucalinda, the serpent king, at the end of those<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span> seven days, having known that the sky<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> was clear and without a cloud, having unwound his coils from the Lord's body, having given up his own form and assumed a youth's form, stood in front of the Lord honouring the Lord with joined palms.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Then the Lord, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this (solemn) utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> "Happy his solitude who glad at heart<br />
							Hath <i>Dhamma</i> learnt and doth the vision see!<br />
							Happy is that benignity towards<br />
							The world which on no creature worketh harm.<br />
							Happy the absence of all lust, th'ascent<br />
							Past and beyond the needs of sense-desires.<br />
							He who doth crush the great 'I am' conceit —<br />
							This, truly this, is happiness supreme."</p>

					The Talk at the Rājāyatana Tree</h4>

					<p class="f4">1. Then the Lord, at the end of seven days, having emerged from that contemplation, approached the Rājāyatana<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> from the foot of the Mucalinda; having approached, he sat cross-legged in one (posture) for seven days at the foot of the Rājāyatana experiencing the bliss of freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> were going along the high-road from Ukkalā to that district.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> Then a <i>devatā</i> who was a blood-relation of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika: "My good fellows, this Lord, having just (become) wholly awakened, is staying at the foot of the Rājāyatana, go and serve that Lord with barley-gruel<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> and honey-balls, and this will be a blessing and happiness for you for a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, taking barley-gruel and honey-balls, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they stood at a respectful distance. As they were standing at a respectful distance, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord receive our barley-gruel and honey-balls, that this may be a blessing and happiness for us for a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Truth-finders<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span> do not <a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> receive with their hands. Now with what shall I receive the barley-gruel and honey-balls?" Then the four Great Kings, knowing with their minds the reasoning in the Lord's mind, from the four quarters presented the Lord with four bowls made of rock crystal, saying: "Lord, let the Lord receive the barley-gruel and honey-balls herein." The Lord received the barley-gruel and the honey-balls in a new<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span> bowl made of rock crystal, and having received them he partook of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, having found that the Lord had removed his hand from the bowl, having inclined their heads towards the Lord's feet, spoke thus to the Lord: "We, Lord, are those going to the Lord for refuge and to <i>Dhamma</i>; let the Lord accept us as lay-disciples gone for refuge for life from this day forth." Thus these came to be the first lay-disciples in the world using the two-word formula.</p>

					The Talk on Brahmā's Entreaty</h4>

					<p class="f4">1. Then the Lord, having emerged from that contemplation at the end of seven days, approached the Goatherds' Banyan from the foot of the Rājāyatana; having approached, the Lord stayed there at the foot of the Goatherds' Banyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then as the Lord was meditating in seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span> "This <i>Dhamma,</i> won to by me, is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful, excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the learned.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> But this is a creation delighting in sensual pleasure,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span> delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure. So that for a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure, this were a matter difficult to see, that is to say causal uprising by way of <a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> cause. This too were a matter very difficult to see,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> that is to say the calming of all the habitual tendencies, the renunciation of all attachment, the destruction of craving, dispassion, stopping, nirvana. And so if I were to teach <i>Dhamma</i> and others were not to understand me, this would be a weariness to me, this would be a vexation to me."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And further, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to the Lord:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">This that through many toils I've won —<br />
							Enough! Why should I make it known?<br />
							By folk with lust and hate consumed<br />
							This <i>Dhamma</i> is not understood.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Leading on against the stream,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Subtle, deep, difficult to see, delicate,<br />
							Unseen 'twill be by passion's slaves<br />
							Cloaked in the murk of ignorance."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">4. In such wise, as the Lord pondered, his mind inclined to little effort<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> and not to teaching <i>Dhamma</i>. Then it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span> knowing with his mind the reasoning in the Lord's mind: "Alas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span> the world is lost,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span> alas, the world is destroyed, inasmuch as the mind of the Truth-finder, the perfected one, the fully awakened one, inclines to little effort and not to teaching <i>Dhamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Then as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did Brahmā Sahampati, vanishing from the Brahmā-world, become manifest before the Lord.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">6. Then Brahmā Sahampati, having arranged his upper robe <a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> over one shoulder, having stooped his right knee to the ground having saluted the Lord with joined palms, spoke thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach <i>Dhamma,</i> let the Well-farer teach <i>Dhamma</i>; there are beings with little dust in their eyes who, not hearing <i>Dhamma,</i> are decaying, (but if) they are learners of <i>Dhamma,</i> they will grow."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">7. Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati; having said this, he further spoke thus:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There has appeared in Magadha before thee<br />
					An unclean <i>Dhamma</i> by impure minds devised.<br />
					Open this door of deathlessness, let<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span> them hear<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i> awakened to by the stainless one<br />
					As on a crag on crest of mountain standing<br />
					A man might watch the people far below,<br />
					E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br />
					O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples<br />
					Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.<br />
					Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br />
					Thou freed from debt! Man of the caravan!<br />
					Walk the world over, let the Blessed One<br />
					Teach <i>Dhamma</i>. They who learn will grow."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">8. When he had spoken thus, the Lord spoke thus to Brahmā Sahampati: "Brahmā, it occurred to me: 'This <i>Dhamma</i> penetrated by me is deep ... that would be a vexation to me.' And further, Brahmā, these verses not heard before in the past occurred spontaneously to me: 'This that through many toils I've won ... cloaked in the murk of ignorance.' In such wise, Brahmā, as I pondered, my mind inclined to little effort and not to teaching <i>Dhamma</i>."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Then a second time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach <i>Dhamma</i> ... if they are <a id="pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> learners of <i>Dhamma,</i> they will grow." Then a second time did the Lord speak thus to Brahmā Sahampati:" But, Brahmā, it occurred to me : ... my mind inclined to little effort and and not to teaching <i>Dhamma</i>."</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Then a third time did Brahmā Sahampati speak thus to the Lord: "Lord, let the Lord teach <i>Dhamma</i> ... if they are learners of <i>Dhamma,</i> they will grow." Then the Lord, having understood Brahmā's entreaty and, out of compassion for beings, surveyed the world with the eye of an awakened one. As the Lord was surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one, he saw beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with acute faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing fear in sins and the worlds beyond.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn51" href="#n51">51</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">11. Even as in<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn52" href="#n52">52</a>]</sup></span> a pond of blue lotuses or in a pond of red lotuses or in a pond of white lotuses, a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, do not rise above the water but thrive while altogether immersed; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water and reach to the surface of the water; a few blue or red or white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, and stand up rising out of the water, undefiled by the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. Even so, did the Lord, surveying the world with the eye of an awakened one, see beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with acute faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing fear in sins and the worlds beyond. Seeing Brahmā Sahampati, he addressed him with verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Open for those who hear are the doors of deathlessness;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn53" href="#n53">53</a>]</sup></span><br />
							let them renounce their faith<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Thinking of useless fatigue, I have not preached, Brahmā,<br />
							the sublime and excellent <i>Dhamma</i> to men."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[]</b></span></a> 13. Then Brahmā Sahampati, thinking: "The opportunity was made by me for the Lord to teach <i>Dhamma</i>,"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span> greeting the Lord, keeping his right side towards him, vanished then and there.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn57" href="#n57">57</a>]</sup></span></p>

					The First Discourse</h4>

					<p class="f4">1. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, to whom should I first teach <i>Dhamma</i>? Who will understand this <i>Dhamma</i> quickly?" Then it occurred to the Lord: "Indeed, this Āḷāra the Kālāma<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn58" href="#n58">58</a>]</sup></span> is learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach <i>Dhamma</i> first to Āḷāra the Kālāma? He will understand this <i>Dhamma</i> quickly."</p>

					<p class="f4">2. But then an invisible <i>devatā</i> announced to the Lord: "Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago." And the knowledge arose to the Lord that Āḷāra the Kālāma had passed away seven days ago. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Āḷāra the Kālāma was of great intelligence. If he had heard this <i>Dhamma,</i> he would have understood it quickly."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, to whom should I first teach <i>Dhamma</i>? Who will understand this <i>Dhamma</i> quickly?" Then it occurred to the Lord: "Indeed, this Uddaka, Rāma's son,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn59" href="#n59">59</a>]</sup></span> is learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I were to teach <i>Dhamma</i> first to Uddaka, Rāma's son? He will understand this dhamma quickly."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. But then an invisible <i>devatā</i> announced to the Lord: "Lord, Uddaka, Rāma's son, passed away last night." And the knowledge arose to the Lord that Uddaka, Rāma's son, had passed away last night. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Uddaka, Rāma's son, was of great intelligence. If he had <a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a> heard this <i>Dhamma,</i> he would have understood it quickly."</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Then it occurred to the Lord: "Now, to whom should I first teach <i>Dhamma</i>? Who will understand this dhamma quickly?" Then it occurred to the Lord: "That group of five monks<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn60" href="#n60">60</a>]</sup></span> who waited on me when I was self-resolute in striving<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn61" href="#n61">61</a>]</sup></span> were very helpful. Suppose I were to teach dhamma first to the group of five monks?"</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Then it occurred to the Lord: "But where is this group of five monks staying at present?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn62" href="#n62">62</a>]</sup></span> Then the Lord with <i>deva-</i>vision, purified and surpassing that of men, saw the group of five monks staying near Benares at Isipatana in the deer-park. Then the Lord, having stayed at Uruvelā for as long as he found suiting, set out on tour for Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Upaka, a Naked Ascetic,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn63" href="#n63">63</a>]</sup></span> saw the Lord going along the highroad between Gayā and<br />
					the (Tree of) Awakening; seeing him, he spoke thus to the Lord: "Your reverence, your sense-organs are quite pure, your complexion very bright, very clear. On account of whom have you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose <i>Dhamma</i> do you profess?"</p>

					<p class="f4">8. When this had been said, the Lord addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, in verses:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn64" href="#n64">64</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Victorious over all, omniscient am I,<br />

The group of five monks saw the Lord coming in the distance; seeing him, they agreed among themselves, saying: "Your reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming, he lives in abundance, he is wavering in his striving, he has reverted to a life of abundance.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span> He should neither be greeted, nor stood up for, nor should his bowl and robe be received; all the same a seat may be put out, he can sit down if he wants to."</p>

					<p class="f4">11. But as the Lord gradually approached this group of five monks, so this group of five monks, not adhering to their own agreement, having gone towards the Lord, one received his bowl and robe, one made ready a seat, one brought water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, a foot-stand.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span> The Lord sat down on the seat made ready, and the Lord, while he was sitting down, washed his feet.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span> Further, they addressed the Lord by name and with the epithet of 'your reverence.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">12. When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "Do not, monks, address a Truthfinder by name, and with the epithet 'your reverence'. A Truthfinder, monks, is a perfected one, a fully awakened one. Give ear, monks, the deathless has been found; <i>I</i> instruct, <i>I</i> teach <i>Dhamma</i>.

So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to the eminence of the truly ariyan vision of knowledge, when you live in abundance, are wavering in striving, and have reverted to a life of abundance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">14. When this had been said, the Lord spoke thus to the group of five monks: "A Truthfinder, monks, does not live in abundance, he does not waver in striving, he does not revert to a life of abundance.

And the Lord was able to convince the group of five monks.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a>]</sup></span> Then the group of five monks listened to the Lord again, gave ear to him and aroused their minds for profound knowledge.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn82" href="#n82">82</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">18. "And what, monks, is this middle course fully awakened to by the Truthfinder, making for vision, making for knowledge, which conduces to calming, to super-knowledge, to awakening, to nirvana?

					<p class="f4">19. "And this, monks, is the ariyan truth of ill: birth is ill, and old age is ill and disease is ill and dying is ill, association with what is not dear is ill, separation from what is dear is ill, not getting what one wants is ill — in short the five groups of grasping are ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">20.

					<p class="f4">27. "And so long, monks, the vision of knowledge of these four ariyan truths, with the three sections and twelve modes<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn102" href="#n102">102</a>]</sup></span> as they really are, was not well purified by me, so long was I, monks, not thoroughly awakened with the supreme full awakening as to the world with its <i>devas,</i> with its Māras, with its Brahmās, with its recluses and Brahmāns, its creatures with <i>devas</i> and men.

					<p class="f4">28.

					<p class="f4">29. "Moreover, the vision of knowledge arose in me: 'Freedom of mind is for me unshakeable, this the last birth, there is not now again-becoming.'"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn103" href="#n103">103</a>]</sup></span> Thus spoke the Lord; delighted, the group of five monks rejoiced in the Lord's utterance. Moreover, while this discourse<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn104" href="#n104">104</a>]</sup></span> was being uttered, <i>Dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the venerable Koṇḍañña that "whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop."</p>

					<p class="f4">30. And when the Lord had rolled the <i>Dhamma</i>-wheel, the earth <i>devas</i> made this sound heard:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn105" href="#n105">105</a>]</sup></span> "The supreme <i>Dhamma</i>-wheel rolled thus by the Lord at Benares in the deer-park at <a id="pg18"><span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span></a> Isipatana cannot be rolled back by a recluse or brahmin or <i>deva</i> or by Māra or by Brahmā or by anyone in the world." Having heard the sound of the earth devas, the devas of the Four Great Kings<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn106" href="#n106">106</a>]</sup></span> made this sound heard ... the Thirty devas ... Yama's devas ... the Happy devas ... the devas who delight in creation ... the devas who delight in the creation of others ... the devas of Brahmā's retinue made this sound heard: "The supreme <i>Dhamma</i>-wheel rolled thus by the Lord at Benares in the deer-park at Isipatana cannot be rolled back by a recluse or brahmin or <i>deva</i> or by Māra or by Brahmā or by anyone in the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">31. In this wise in that moment, in that second, in that instant, the sound reached as far as the Brahmā-world, and the ten thousandfold world-system<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn107" href="#n107">107</a>]</sup></span> trembled, quaked, shook violently and a radiance, splendid, measureless, surpassing the <i>devas'</i> own glory,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn108" href="#n108">108</a>]</sup></span> was manifest in the world. Then the Lord uttered this solemn utterance: "Indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood, indeed, Koṇḍañña has understood." Thus it was that Aññata Koṇḍañña<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn109" href="#n109">109</a>]</sup></span> became the venerable Koṇḍañña's name.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn110" href="#n110">110</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">32. Then the venerable Aññata Koṇḍañña, having seen <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n110">110</a>]</sup></span> attained <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn111" href="#n111">111</a>]</sup></span> known <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n110">110</a>]</sup></span> plunged into <i>Dhamma,</i> having crossed over doubt, having put away uncertainty, having attained without another's help to full confidence in the teacher's instruction,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn112" href="#n112">112</a>]</sup></span> spoke thus to the Lord: "May I, Lord, receive the going forth<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn113" href="#n113">113</a>]</sup></span> in the Lord's presence, may I receive ordination?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn114" href="#n114">114</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, monk,"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn115" href="#n115">115</a>]</sup></span> the Lord said, "well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> <a id="pg19"><span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></a> fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this came to be this venerable one's ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">33. Then the Lord exhorted, instructed those remaining monks with <i>Dhamma</i>-talk. Then<br />
					while they were being exhorted, instructed by the Lord with <i>Dhamma</i>-talk, <i>Dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the venerable Vappa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn116" href="#n116">116</a>]</sup></span> and to the venerable Bhaddiya,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn117" href="#n117">117</a>]</sup></span> that "whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop."</p>

					<p class="f4">34. These, having seen <i>Dhamma,</i> attained <i>Dhamma,</i> known <i>Dhamma</i> . . . having attained<br />
					without another's help to full confidence in the teacher's instruction, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">May we, Lord, receive the going forth in the Lord's presence, may we receive ordination?" "Come, monks," the Lord said, "well taught is <i>Dhamma,</i> fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So this came to be these venerable ones' ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">35. Then the Lord, eating the food brought back by these,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn118" href="#n118">118</a>]</sup></span> exhorted, instructed those remaining monks with <i>Dhamma</i>-talk, saying: "Let the group of six<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn119" href="#n119">119</a>]</sup></span> live on whatever the three monks<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn120" href="#n120">120</a>]</sup></span> bring when they have walked for almsfood."</p>

					<p class="f4">36. Then while they were being exhorted, instructed by the Lord with <i>Dhamma</i>-talk, <i>Dhamma</i>-vision, dustless, stainless, arose to the venerable Mahānāma<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn121" href="#n121">121</a>]</sup></span> and to the venerable Assaji,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn122" href="#n122">122</a>]</sup></span> that "whatever is of the nature to uprise, all that is of the nature to stop."</p>

					<p class="f4">37. These, having seen <i>Dhamma,</i> attained <i>Dhamma</i> ... having attained without another's help to full confidence in the teacher's instruction, spoke thus to the Lord: "May we, Lord, receive the going forth in the Lord's presence, may we receive ordination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, monks," the Lord said, "well taught is <i>Dhamma,</i> fare the Brahma-faring for making an utter end of ill." So <a id="pg20"><span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></a> this came to be these venerable ones' ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">38. Then the Lord addressed the group of five monks, saying: "Body, monks, is not self.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn123" href="#n123">123</a>]</sup></span> Now were this body self, monks this body would not tend to sickness, and one might get the chance of saying in regard to body, 'Let body become thus for me, let body not become thus for me'. But inasmuch, monks, as body is not self, therefore body tends to sickness, and one does not get the chance of saying in regard to body, 'Let body become thus for me, let body not become thus for me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">39. Feeling is not self ... and one does not get the chance of saying in regard to feeling, 'Let feeling become thus for me, let feeling not become thus for me'.</p>

					<p class="f4">40. "Perception<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn124" href="#n124">124</a>]</sup></span> is not self ...

					<p class="f4">41. "Consciousness is not self ... Inasmuch, monks, as consciousness is not self, therefore consciousness tends to sickness, and one does not get the chance to say in regard to consciousness, 'Let consciousness become such for me, let consciousness not become thus for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, monks? Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is that which is impermanent painful or pleasurable?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn125" href="#n125">125</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Painful, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">42. "But is it fit to consider that which is impermanent, painful, of a nature to change, as 'This is mine, this am I, this is my self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not so, Lord." || 43 ||</p>

					<p class="f4">44. "Wherefore, monks, whatever is body, past, future, present or internal or external, or gross or subtle, or low or excellent whether it is far or near — all body should, by means of right wisdom, be seen, as it really is, thus: This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">45. "Whatever is feeling ... whatever is perception ... whatever are the habitual tendencies ... whatever is consciousness past, future, present, or internal or external, or gross or subtle, or low or excellent, whether far or near — all consciousness should, by means of right wisdom, be seen as it really is, thus: This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">46. "Seeing in this way, monks, the instructed<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn126" href="#n126">126</a>]</sup></span> disciple of the ariyans disregards<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn127" href="#n127">127</a>]</sup></span> body and he disregards feeling and he disregards perception and he disregards the habitual tendencies and he disregards consciousness; disregarding he is dispassionate; through dispassion he is freed; in freedom the knowledge comes to be: 'I am freed',<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn128" href="#n128">128</a>]</sup></span> and he knows: Destroyed is birth, lived is the Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such or such."</p>

					<p class="f4">47. Thus spoke the Lord; delighted, the group of five monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said. Moreover while this discourse was being uttered, the minds of the group of five monks were freed from the cankers without grasping. At that time there were six perfected ones in the world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> Verses also at <i>M.</i> i. 171; quoted at <i>Kvu.</i> 289; <i>ThigA.</i> 220.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> <i>arah'asi,</i> also meaning "you deserve to be, are worthy or fit to be". There is also the reading <i>arahā asi,</i> as at <i>Kvu.</i> 289, and see <i>Pss. Sisters,</i> 129 <i>f.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> <i>anantajina.</i> <i>VA.</i> 964 merely says "You are set on becoming a victor of the unending." <i>Ananta,</i> the unending, may refer to <i>Dhamma,</i> also to <i>nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> This verse and Upaka's remarks are quoted at <i>Kvu.</i> 289. </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> <i>hupeyya.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 171, <i>SnA.</i> 258, <i>ThigA.</i> 220 read <i>huveyya</i> (which is interchangeable with <i>hupeyya</i>). It is a dialectical form of <i>bhaveyya</i>. According to B.M. Barua, <i>The Ājīvikas,</i> p. 50, it is an expression found in the "Ājīvika language" and "is not a recognised Pali word." He translates "perhaps it may be so," Oldenberg "it may be so," Chalmers, preserving the patois, "mebbe" E.J. Thomas, <i>The Life of Buddha,</i> p. 83, "would that it might be so", <i>DPPN </i> (under Upaka) "it may be so"; while Mrs. Rhys Davids, <i>To Become or not to Become,</i> p. 85, would prefer "may he become", the "he" referring to the man, every man, to whom Gotama was prepared to teach his message. She suggests that he will have rehearsed this message to Upaka, and maintains that what has survived — "a glaringly imperfect misrepresentation" — makes omission and glossing all but certain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> I think that as the text stands, had Upaka been convinced or event interested he would not have departed by a different road (<i>ummagga,</i> also meaning the wrong road). It is perhaps odd that this episode, if it snows disagreement, is presumed to have occurred at the beginning of Gotama ministry. But it may be included to emphasize his determination to preach first of all to the "five" in accordance with his decision; or to show that Upaka spoke somewhat as a prophet — in the "key", below, p. 127, he is called <i>Upako isi,</i> Upaka the seer. According to <i>ThigA.</i> 220 f., when Upaka was an old man, tormented by his wife's gibes, he sought Gotama and went forth into homelessness; he then soon attained the stage of non-returning and died. From this account it does not appear that he had had any great urge earlier to become one of Gotama's disciples.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In the translation above I have put a slight bias on three words, each of which admits of more than one rendering, so as to mark consistently what seems to me to be Upaka's apparent failure to be convinced: (1) <i>arahasi</i> = (a) you ought to be (slightly contemptuous), (b) you are worthy to be (respectful); (2) <i>huveyya,</i> discussed in preceding note; (3) <i>sīsam okampetvā,</i> having shaken his head. <i>Okampeti</i> may mean, according to PED, both to wag and to shake. Indians shake their heads from side to side to show disagreement, but wag them up and down to show agreement.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> <i>bahulla.</i> As Mrs. Rhys Davids observes. <i>Manual,</i> 69, this means literally "muchness", <i>VA.</i> 964 taking it to mean abundance of robes, etc.</p>
