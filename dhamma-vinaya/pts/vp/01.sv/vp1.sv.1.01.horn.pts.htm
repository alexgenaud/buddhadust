					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the enlightened one, the lord, was staying at Verañjā<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> near Naḷeru's Nimba tree<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> with a great company of five hundred monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A brahmin<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> of Verañjā heard:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Verily, good sir,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> the recluse<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> Gotama, son of the Sakyans,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> having gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is staying at Verañjā near Naḷeru's Nimba tree with a great company of five hundred monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The highest praise<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> has gone forth concerning the lord Gotama:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'He is indeed lord, perfected one,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, unrivalled trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and mankind, the enlightened <a id="pg2" href="#pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> one, the lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having brought to fulfilment his own powers of realisation, he makes known this world, together with devas including the Māras, and the Brahmās; creatures, together with recluses and brahmins, together with devas and men.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He teaches dhamma, lovely at the beginning, lovely at the middle and lovely at the ending.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He explains with the spirit and the letter the Brahma-life completely fulfilled and wholly pure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Good indeed it were to see perfected men like that.'"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> <span class="f2">[|1|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin of Verañjā came up to the lord, and having come up he exchanged friendly greetings with the lord, and having exchanged friendly greetings he sat down <span class="f2"><b>[1]</b></span> to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting to one side, the brahmin of Verañjā spoke thus to the lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I have heard, good<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> Gotama, that the recluse Gotama does not greet brahmins who are worn, old, stricken in years, who have lived their span and are at the close of their life<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>; nor does he stand up or ask them to sit down.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Likewise, good Gotama, that the revered<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> Gotama does not greet brahmins who are worn, old, stricken in years, who have lived their span and are at the close of their life; nor does he greet them or stand up or ask them to sit down.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now this, good Gotama, this is not respectful."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, I do not see him in the world of devas including the Māras, including the Brahmās, including recluses and brahmins, of creatures including devas and mankind, whom I should greet or rise up for or to whom I should offer a seat.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, brahmin, whom a Tathāgata <a id="pg3" href="#pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> should greet or rise up for or offer a seat to, his head would split asunder."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> <span class="f2">[|2|]</span></p>

					<p class="f4">"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one speaking truly of me could say:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is without the quality of taste.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, brahmin, tastes for forms, tastes for sounds, tastes for scents, tastes for savours, tastes for tangible objects — these have been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root like a palm-tree, they are so utterly done away with that they are not able to come into future existence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is a way in which one speaking truly of me could say:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is without the quality of taste.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For, brahmin, enjoyments of forms, enjoyments of sounds, enjoyments of scents, enjoyments of savours, enjoyments of tangible objects — these have been destroyed by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root like a palm-tree, they are so utterly done away with that they are not able to come into future existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama professes the doctrine of annihilation.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For I, brahmin, speak of the annihilation of passion, of hatred and of confusion<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span>; I speak of the annihilation of manifold evil and wrong states.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who, brahmin, has destroyed the searing, evil, wrong states, having cut them off at the root like a palm-tree, who has done away with them so utterly that they can come to no future existence — him I call one who practises austerities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The revered Gotama is not destined to another (kind of) becoming,"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is indeed, brahmin, a way in which one speaking truly of me could say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, brahmin, he whose future conception in a womb, whose rebirth in future becomings is destroyed and cut off like a palm-tree at the root, are so utterly done away with that they can come to no future existence — him I call one not destined to another becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata's future conception in a womb, his rebirth in a new becoming, is destroyed and cut off at the root like a palm-tree, are so utterly done away with that he can come to no future existence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This indeed, brahmin, is a way in which one speaking truly of me could say:</p>

					<p class="f4">But surely you did not mean that." <span class="f2">[|3|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, it is like a hen<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> with eight or ten or twelve eggs on which she has sat properly, properly warmed and properly hatched; is that chick which should win forth safely, having first of all pierced through the egg-shell with the point of the claw on its foot, or with its beak, to be called the eldest or the youngest?" he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"He is to be called the eldest, good Gotama, for he is the eldest of these," he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Even so I, brahmin, having pierced through the shell of ignorance for the sake of creatures going in ignorance, born of eggs, <span class="f2"><b>[3]</b></span> covered over, am <a id="pg7" href="#pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> unique<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> in the world, utterly enlightened with unsurpassed enlightenment.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I myself, brahmin, am the world's eldest<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> and highest.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span> <span class="f2">[|4|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Brahmin,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span> I had steadily put forth energy, clear mindfulness had arisen, my body was quieted and calm, my mind was composed and one-pointed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I, brahmin, aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from wrong states of mind, having attained the first musing with its reflection and investigation that is born of solitude, zestful and easeful, abided therein.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the mastery of reflection and investigation, having inner faith, the mind become concentrated,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span> without reflection, without investigation, having attained the second musing that is born of contemplation, zestful and easeful, I abided therein.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the fading out of zest, I dwelt poised, mindful and attentive, and I experienced welfare as to the body, attaining the third musing which the noble ones describe in these terms:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"He who is poised and mindful dwells happily,"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I abided therein.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the rejection of ease<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> and by the rejection of discomfort,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> by the annihilation of the rejoicing and the sorrowing I had before, having attained to that state which is neither pleasant nor painful, that utter purity of mindfulness which is poised, which is the fourth musing, I abided therein.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span> <span class="f2">[|5|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, fixed and <a id="pg8" href="#pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> come to utter peace,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> I directed the mind<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> towards the knowledge of the memory of former becomings; thus I remember divers former becomings; that is to say, one birth,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, and many an æon of disintegration of the world, and many an æon of its reintegration<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span> and many æons of both its disintegration and reintegration: such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, having such and such a colour,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> so was I nourished, such and such easeful and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Passing from this, I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, having such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such easeful and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Passing from this, I came to be here, thus I remember divers former becomings in all their modes and in detail.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, was the first knowledge attained by me in the first watch of that night.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, even as I abided zealous, ardent, with a self that has striven.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This was, brahmin, my first <a id="pg9" href="#pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> successful breaking forth, like a chick's from the eggshell. <span class="f2">[|6|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then with the mind collected, clarified, purified, flawless, void of taints, grown soft and pliable, fixed and come to utter peace, I directed the mind towards the knowledge of the arising and passing hence of beings; <span class="f2"><b>[4]</b></span> so that with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, I behold beings, I know beings as they pass away or come to be — mean, excellent, fair, foul, in a good bourn,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span> in a bad bourn<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span> according to their actions, and I think:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Indeed, those worthies<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span> whose deeds were evil, whose speech was evil, whose thoughts were evil, abusers of the noble ones, holders of wrong views, incurring<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span> the actions<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span> of wrong views — these at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in the waste, the bad bourn, the abyss, hell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, those good sirs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span> whose deeds were good, whose speech was good, whose thoughts were good, who did not abuse the noble ones, holding right views, incurring the actions of right views — these at the breaking up of the body after death, have arisen in the good bourn, the heaven-world.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus with purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, do I behold beings, I know beings as they pass away and come to be — mean, excellent, fair, foul, in a good bourn, in a bad bourn according to their actions.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, was the second knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of that night.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, even as I abided zealous, ardent, with a self that has striven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This was, brahmin, my second successful breaking forth, like a chick's from the egg-shell. <span class="f2">[|7|]</span></p>

					<p class="f4">I knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">The son of a Kalandaka, the great merchant<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn111" href="#n111">111</a>]</sup></span> there, was named Sudinna, the Kalandaka.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg22" href="#pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> </p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now Sudinna the Kalandaka<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn112" href="#n112">112</a>]</sup></span> went to Vesālī, together with many friends, on some <span class="f2"><b>[11]</b></span> business.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that time the lord was seated, surrounded by a great company of people, and teaching dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When Sudinna, the Kalandaka, saw the lord seated, surrounded by a great company of people, and teaching dhamma, he thoµght:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn113" href="#n113">113</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What now if I were to listen to dhamma?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn114" href="#n114">114</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka, came up to this company, and having come up, he sat down to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting to one side, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"So far as I understand dhamma taught by the lord, it is no easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the Brahma-life, complete and undefiled and polished like a conch-shell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What now if I were to cut off my hair and beard and don the yellow robes and go forth from home into homelessness?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the crowd had been taught, roused, gladdened and delighted by the lord with talk on dhamma, and had risen from their seats, greeting the lord and walking round him, keeping their right side towards him, they departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And not long after the crowd had departed Sudinna, the Kalandaka, came up to the lord and having come up, he greeted the lord and sat down to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting to one side, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to the lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Lord, so far as I understand dhamma taught by the lord, it is not an easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the Brahma-life, complete and undefiled and polished like a conch-shell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I desire, lord, having cut off my hair and beard and having donned the yellow robes, to go forth from home into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the lord let me go forth."</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg23" href="#pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But, Sudinna, have you your parents' consent to go forth?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I have not my parents' consent to go forth."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sudinna, Tathāgatas do not ordain a child without the parents' consent."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I will do whatever is necessary, so that my parents will consent to my going forth from home into homelessness, lord." <span class="f2">[|1|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka, having finished his business in Vesālī, went up to his parents in the village of Kalandaka, and having come up to his parents, he spoke thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Mother and father, in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the lord, it is no easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the Brahma-life, complete and undefiled and polished like a conch-shell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having cut off my hair and beard and donned the yellow robes, I wish to go forth from home <span class="f2"><b>[12]</b></span> into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Give me your consent to go forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When Sudinna, the Kalandaka, had spoken thus, his parents said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But you, dear Sudinna, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dear Sudinna, you do not know anything of discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make us desolate with no pleasure left.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How can we, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to his parents:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Mother and father, in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the lord, it is no easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the Brahma-life, complete and undefiled and polished like a conch-shell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having cut off my hair and beard and donned the yellow robes, I wish to go forth from home into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Give me your consent to go forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When Sudinna, the Kalandaka, had spoken thus, his parents said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But you, dear Sudinna, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dear Sudinna, you do not know anything of discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make us desolate with no pleasure left.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How can we, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to his parents:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Mother and father, in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the lord, it is no easy matter for one who lives in a house to lead the Brahma-life, complete and undefiled and polished like a conch-shell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having cut off my hair and beard and donned the yellow robes, I wish to go forth from home into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Give me your consent to go forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When Sudinna, the Kalandaka, had spoken thus, his parents said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But you, dear Sudinna, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dear Sudinna, you do not know anything of discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make us desolate with no pleasure left.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How can we, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?"</p>					

					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka, said:</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">"My parents do not consent to my going forth from home into homelessness."</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">So he lay down on the bare ground and said:</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">"I will die here, or go forth."</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka,<br />
					did not eat one meal,<br />
					nor did he eat two <a id="pg24" href="#pg24"><span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></a> meals,<br />
					nor did he eat three meals,<br />
					nor did he eat four meals,<br />
					nor did he eat five meals,<br />
					nor did he eat six meals,<br />
					nor did he eat seven meals.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn115" href="#n115">115</a>]</sup></span></p>					
					
					<p class="f4">And then the parents of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Dear Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Dear Sudinna, you know nothing of discomfort.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make us desolate with no pleasure left.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">How can we, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Get up, dear Sudinna, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking, amusing yourself, delighting in sensual pleasures and doing meritorious deeds,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn116" href="#n116">116</a>]</sup></span> enjoy yourself.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn117" href="#n117">117</a>]</sup></span></p>					
					
					<p class="f4">We do not consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When they had spoken thus, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, was silent.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">A second time the parents of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to him:</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">"Dear Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Dear Sudinna, you know nothing of discomfort.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make us desolate with no pleasure left.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">How can we, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Get up, dear Sudinna, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking, amusing yourself, delighting in sensual pleasures and doing meritorious deeds, enjoy yourself.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">We do not consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time was Sudinna, the Kalandaka, silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A third time the parents of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to him:</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">"Dear Sudinna, you are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Dear Sudinna, you know nothing of discomfort.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make us desolate with no pleasure left.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">How can we, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Get up, dear Sudinna, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking, amusing yourself, delighting in sensual pleasures and doing meritorious deeds, enjoy yourself.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">We do not consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A third time was Sudinna, the Kalandaka, silent. <span class="f2">[|2|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the friends of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, came up to him, and having come up they spoke to him thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"You, good Sudinna, are your <span class="f2"><b>[13]</b></span> parents' only child, dear and beloved; you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You do not know anything, good Sudinna, of discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Get up, good Sudinna.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, take delight in sensual pleasures and doing meritorious deeds, enjoy yourself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your parents <a id="pg25" href="#pg25"><span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span></a> cannot consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When they had spoken thus, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, was silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a second time the friends of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, came up to him, and having come up they spoke to him thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"You, good Sudinna, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved; you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You do not know anything, good Sudinna, of discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your death would make your parents desolate with no pleasures left.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How can they, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Get up, good Sudinna.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, take delight in sensual pleasures and doing meritorious deeds, enjoy yourself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your parents cannot consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a second time when they had spoken thus, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, was silent.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Then a third time the friends of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, came up to him, and having come up they spoke to him thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"You, good Sudinna, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved; you live in comfort and are well cared for.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You do not know anything, good Sudinna, of discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can they, while you are still living, consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Get up, good Sudinna.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, take delight in sensual pleasures and doing meritorious deeds, enjoy yourself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your parents cannot consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a third time, when they had spoken thus, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, was silent. <span class="f2">[|3|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the friends of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, went up to his parents, and having come up to them, they said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Mother and father, this Sudinna, lying on the bare ground, says that he will die there or go forth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you do not consent to Sudinna's going forth from home into homelessness he will die there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if you consent to his going forth from home into homelessness, after he has gone forth you may see him again.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he does not enjoy the going forth from home into homelessness, what alternative<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn118" href="#n118">118</a>]</sup></span> will he have than to come back here?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consent to Sudinna's going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We consent, my dears, to Sudinna's going forth from home into homelessness," they said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the friends of Sudinna, the Kalandaka, went up to him, and having gone up, they said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Get up, good Sudinna, your parents consent to your going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka, said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"They say that my parents consent to my going forth from home into homelessness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he rose, joyful, delighted, elated, smoothing his limbs with his hands.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka, after a few days when he had regained his strength, went up to the lord, and having come up he greeted the lord and sat down to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting to one side, Sudinna, the Kalandaka, spoke thus to the lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I am permitted by my parents, lord, to go forth from home into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the lord allow me to go forth." <span class="f2"><b>[14]</b></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg26" href="#pg26"><span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span></a></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sudinna, the Kalandaka, received the <i>pabbajjā</i> ordination in the presence of the lord, and he received the <i>upasampadā</i> ordination.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And not long afterwards the venerable Sudinna went about with these qualities<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn119" href="#n119">119</a>]</sup></span> to the fore:<br />
					he was a dweller in the jungle,<br />
					a beggar for alms,<br />
					one who wore rags taken from the dust-heap,<br />
					one who went on continuous alms-begging from house to house;<br />
					and he dwelt depending on a certain village of the Vajjians. <span class="f2">[|4|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that time the Vajjians<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn120" href="#n120">120</a>]</sup></span> were short of almsfood,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn121" href="#n121">121</a>]</sup></span> which was difficult to obtain; they were suffering from a famine, and food-tickets werp issued.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Nor was it easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sudinna thought to himself:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"At present the Vajjians are short of almsfood, which is difficult to obtain; they are suffering from a famine, and food-tickets are being issued.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is not easy to keep oneself going by gleaning or by favour.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But in Vesālī my relations are rich, with great resources and possessions, having immense (supplies of) gold and silver,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn122" href="#n122">122</a>]</sup></span> immense means and immense resources in corn.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn123" href="#n123">123</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">What now if I should dwell supported by my family?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Relations will give gifts for my support, they will do meritorious actions; and the monks will profit and I will not go short of almsfood."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna, packing up his bedding and taking his bowl and robe, set out for Vesālī, where he arrived in due course.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The venerable Sudinna stayed there at Vesālī in the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The relations of the venerable Sudinna said to themselves:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"They say that Sudinna, the Kalandaka, <a id="pg27" href="#pg27"><span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span></a> has arrived at Vesālī."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And they brought him as a gift of food sixty offerings of barley.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn124" href="#n124">124</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna, having given these sixty offerings of barley to the monks, rising early and taking his bowl and robe, entered the village of Kalandaka for alms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was going about Kalandaka village on a continuous alms-tour, he came up to his own father's house. <span class="f2">[|5|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that time the female slave of the venerable Sudinna's relations wanted to throw away the previous evening's barley-gruel.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the venerable Sudinna spoke thus to this female slave:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If that, sister, is to be thrown away, put it here in my bowl."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then as the slave-girl of the venerable Sudinna's relations was heaping the previous evening's barley-gruel into his bowl, she recognised his hands and feet and voice.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn125" href="#n125">125</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the female slave of the venerable Sudinna's relations went up to his mother, and having come up she said to her:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If it please you,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn126" href="#n126">126</a>]</sup></span> madam, you should know that the young master<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn127" href="#n127">127</a>]</sup></span> Sudinna is back?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now then, if you speak the truth, I will make you a freed woman."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that time the venerable Sudinna was eating the previous evening's barley-gruel in the room provided for the purpose.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn128" href="#n128">128</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the <span class="f2"><b>[15]</b></span> venerable Sudinna's father coming from work, saw the venerable Sudinna <a id="pg28" href="#pg28"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span></a> eating the previous evening's barley-gruel in the room provided for the purpose; and seeing the venerable Sudinna he came up to him, and having come up he said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Can it be, dear Sudinna, that you are eating last evening's barley-gruel?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Surely, dear Sudinna, you should go into your own home?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We went, householder, to your house; hence last evening's barley-gruel."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the father of the venerable Sudinna, taking him by the arm, said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Come, dear Sudinna, we will go to the house."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna came up to the dwelling of his own father, and having come up he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the father of the venerable Sudinna said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Eat, dear Sudinna."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Not so, householder; today's meal is over for me."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Consent, dear Sudinna, to eat tomorrow."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The venerable Sudinna consented by keeping silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna, rising from his seat, departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the mother of the venerable Sudinna, having had the ground smeared with fresh cow-dung, had two heaps made, one of gold coins<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn129" href="#n129">129</a>]</sup></span> and the other <a id="pg29" href="#pg29"><span class="f2 g"><b>[29]</b></span></a> of gold.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The heaps were so large that from this side a man standing could not see a man standing at the other side, and from the other side a man standing could not see a man standing at this side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hiding these heaps with screens, and preparing a seat between them surrounded by a curtain, she addressed the venerable Sudinna's former wife, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself with those orna- <a id="pg30" href="#pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> ments, adorned with which you were dear to my son, Sudinna, and beloved by him."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Very good, noble lady," the former wife of the venerable Sudinna answered his mother. <span class="f2">[|6|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sūdinna, rising early and taking his bowl and robe, came up to the dwelling of his own father, and having come up he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the father of the venerable Sudinna came up to him, and having come up, revealing the heaps, he spoke thus to the venerable Sudinna:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This, dear Sudinna, is your mother's fortune, the wife's dowry because she is a woman.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is your father's and the other is your paternal grandfather's.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn130" href="#n130">130</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is possible, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, both to enjoy riches and to do meritorious actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, enjoy riches and do meritorious actions." <span class="f2"><b>[16]</b></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I am not able to do so, father, I cannot.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Delighted,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn131" href="#n131">131</a>]</sup></span> I lead the Brahma-life."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time the father of the venerable Sudinna spoke thus to the venerable Sudinna:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This, dear Sudinna, is your mother's fortune, the wife's dowry because she is a woman.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is your father's and the other is your paternal grandfather's.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is possible, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, both to enjoy riches and to do meritorious actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, enjoy riches and do meritorious actions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Sudinna responded:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I am not able to do so, father, I cannot.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Delighted, I lead the Brahma-life."</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">A third time the father of the venerable Sudinna spoke thus to the venerable Sudinna:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This, dear Sudinna, is your mother's fortune, the wife's dowry because she is a woman.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is your father's and the other is your paternal grandfather's.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is possible, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, both to enjoy riches and to do meritorious actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, enjoy riches and do meritorious actions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If you would not take it in bad part, householder, we could tell you what (to do)."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Speak, dear Sudinna," he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Well then, you, householder, having had very large bags of hemp-cloth made, having had them filled with the coins and the gold, and having had them brought <a id="pg31" href="#pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a> down on wagons — sink them in the middle stream of the Ganges.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, householder, on account of them you will become either frightened or terrified,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn132" href="#n132">132</a>]</sup></span> or your hair will stand on end, or there will be no protection for you."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken the father of the venerable Sudinna was not pleased, and said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Why does the son, Sudinna, speak thus?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna's father addressed the venerable Sudinna's former wife:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Well now, daughter-in-law, as you were dear and beloved, so perhaps now the son Sudinna will do your bidding."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the former wife of the venerable Sudinna, taking hold of his feet, spoke thus to the venerable Sudinna:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What are these (deva<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn133" href="#n133">133</a>]</sup></span>-)nymphs like, son of my lord, for whose sake you lead the Brahma-life?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I do not lead the Brahma-life, sister, for the sake of (deva<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n133">133</a>]</sup></span>-)nymphs."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the former wife of the venerable Sudinna said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From this day on my lord's son greets me by saying 'sister,'" and she fell down at that very spot in a swoon. <span class="f2">[|7|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna spoke thus to his father:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If, householder, there is food to be given, give it, but do not annoy me."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Eat, dear Sudinna," he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the mother and the father of the venerable Sudinna waited on him and satisfied him with abundant food, both hard and soft.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then when the venerable Sudinna had eaten and had finished his meal his mother said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This family, dear Sudinna, is rich, of great resources and possessions, having immense supplies of gold and silver, immense means, and immense resources in corn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is possible, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, both to enjoy riches and to do meritorious <a id="pg32" href="#pg32"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span></a> actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, dear Sudinna, enjoy riches while leading the low life of a layman and do meritorious actions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Mother, I am not able to do so, <span class="f2"><b>[17]</b></span> I cannot.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Delighted,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn134" href="#n134">134</a>]</sup></span> I lead the good life."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time the mother of the venerable Sudinna spoke to him thus::</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This family, dear Sudinna, is rich, of great resources and possessions, having immense supplies of gold and silver, immense means, and immense resources in corn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is possible, dear Sudinna, while leading the low life of a layman, both to enjoy riches and to do meritorious actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, dear Sudinna, enjoy riches while leading the low life of a layman and do meritorious actions."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Mother, I am not able to do so, I cannot.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Delighted, I lead the good life."</p>					

					<p class="f4">A third time the mother of the venerable Sudinna spoke to him thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This family, dear Sudinna, is rich, of great resources and possessions, having immense (supplies of) gold and silver, immense means, and immense resources in corn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For this reason, dear Sudinna, beget offspring; do not let the Licchavis<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn135" href="#n135">135</a>]</sup></span> take over our heirless property."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is possible for me to do this,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn136" href="#n136">136</a>]</sup></span> mother," he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Where, dear Sudinna, are you staying at present?" she said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In the Great Wood, mother," he said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sudinna, rising up fröm his seat, departed. <span class="f2">[|8|]</span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the mother of the venerable Sudinna addressed his former wife, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Daughter-in-law, as soon as you menstruate, the flow coming, you should tell me."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Very well, noble lady," the former wife of the venerable Sudinna answered his mother.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not long afterwards the former wife of the venerable Sudinna menstruated and the flow began.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the former wife of the venerable Sudinna said to his mother:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Noble lady, I am menstruating and the flow has begun."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Daughter-in-law, adorn yourself with those ornaments, adorned with which you were dear to my son Sudinna and beloved by him," she said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Very well, noble lady," the former wife of the venerable Sudinna answered his mother.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg33" href="#pg33"><span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span></a></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the mother of the venerable Sudinna together with his former wife went up to the venerable Sudinna in the Great Wood, and having come up she spoke thus to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This family, dear Sudinna, is rich, of great resources and possessions, having immense (supplies of) gold and silver, immense means, and immense resources in corn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For this reason, dear Sudinna, beget offspring; do not let the Licchavis take over our heirless property."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is possible for me to do this, mother," he said, and taking his former wife by the arm and plunging into the Great Wood, and seeing no danger, since the course of training had not been made known, three times he induced his former wife to indulge in sexual intercourse with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As a result she conceived.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having eaten, drunk and bathed as much as they liked, not having paid attention to the training, but not having disavowed<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn159" href="#n159">159</a>]</sup></span> it, they indulged in sexual intercourse not having declared their weakness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn160" href="#n160">160</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">These, in the course of time being affected by misfortune to their relatives,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even now, honoured Ānanda, if we might receive the <i>pabbajja</i> ordination in the presence of the lord, if we might receive the <i>upasampada</i> ordination, then contemplating, we would dwell continuously intent upon states which are good, and upon making to become the states belonging to enlightenment.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn161" href="#n161">161</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, if one comes, disavowing the training and declaring his weakness, yet indulging in sexual intercourse, he should receive the <i>upasampada</i> ordination.</p>

Thus they will not suffer and the horses will be kept going." Bu. says, <i>pulakaṃ nāma nitthusan katvā ussedetvā gahitayavataṇḍulā vuccanti,</i> which would seem to mean: "having done away with the husk and having steamed it — pulaka is the name of barley and rice husked and taken after steaming" = steamed — i.e., rice ready for boiling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> <i>ekaṃ hiraññassa ekaṃ suvaṇṇassa.</i> At <i>MN</i> II 63 the reading is <i>hiraññasuvaṇṇassa (puñjaṃ)</i>, translated at <i>Fur. Dial.</i> II 32, "of gold and bullion," and then again "treasure." Rhys Davids, <i>Ancient Coins</i>, etc., p. 5, gives other and earlier translations for both these passages. There is no doubt that two heaps are meant, <i>cf.</i> <i>MA.</i> III 299, and that therefore the two words <i>hirañña</i> and <i>suvaṇṇa</i> are intended to represent a difference in the materials of which the heaps were composed. <i>Cf.</i> below, <i>Vin.</i> III 48, 216, <i>hiraññam vā suvaṇṇam vā.</i> I think that there is little doubt that <i>suvaṇṇa</i> is the worked or refined gold, but it does not appear to follow in the least that <i>hirañña</i> is therefore the unworked, unrefined gold. For at <i>AN</i> I 253 <i>jātarūpa</i> is clearly the unworked (sterling) gold; the process of working this is described, and when finished some gold ornament is the result. (At <i>Vin.</i> III 238 <i>jātarūpa</i> is called <i>satthuvaṇṇa,</i> the colour of the Teacher.) I therefore cannot subscribe to the translation of <i>hiraññasuvaṇṇa</i> at <i>Fur. Dial.</i> II 94 (- <i>MN.</i> II. 166) as "wrought and unwrought gold." <i>Jātarūpa</i> is gold in its unwrought state, therefore, <i>hirañña</i> will almost certainly have some other meaning, with a greater or lesser shade of difference. At p. 79 <i>Comy.,</i> leads one to suppose that <i>hirañña</i> is an ornament; <i>cf.</i> Monier-Williams, <i>Sanskrit-English Dictionary</i> under <i>hiraṇya,</i> where one of the meanings given is "a golden ornament (<i>Ved.</i>)." But I think that hirañña most probably means "gold coins." <i>N.B.</i> — use of the plural at <i>Vin.</i> III 219. According to Boehtlingk <i>(Sanskrit-Wörterbuch)</i> it meant "Gold, später auch Geld," and this is the interpretation put upon it in some commentarial passages, and I think also at <i>SN</i> I 89 where <i>hirañña</i> is balanced by <i>rūpiya,</i> silver (= <i>rajata,</i> see <i>Vin.</i> III 238, 240, except that at 240 <i>rūpiya</i> is also called satthuvaṇṇa, which at 238 is reserved for <i>jātarūpa</i>). <i>VA.</i> 210 on the above passage says that "here hirañña should be called <i>kahā-paṇa.</i>" And at <i>SnA.</i> 323, on <i>Sn.</i> 307, and <i>SnA.</i> 513 on <i>Sn.</i> 769 <i>hirañña</i> is explained as <i>kahāpaṇasaṃkhāta,</i> while at <i>SnA.</i> 315 on <i>Sn.</i> 285 it is said that <i>na hirañña</i> means that "there was not even quarter of a <i>māsaka,</i>" (on <i>māsaka,</i> see below, p. 72). In none of these <i>Sn.</i> passages is <i>hirañña</i> combined with <i>suvaṇṇa,</i> which is interesting and curious. Although the Commentator shows a tendency to call <i>hirañña kahāpaṇa</i>, this does not get us much further. For we do not exactly know what a <i>kahāpaṇa</i> was at any given time. At <i>Vin.</i> III 238, 240 it appears in the definitions of <i>rajata</i> and <i>rūpiya,</i> but at the time of the Vinaya its value may have been different from that which it had at Bu.'s time. All we can say is that the <i>kahāpaṇa</i> was the medium of exchange in Pali literature, and because the Commentators sometimes explain <i>hirañña</i> by <i>kahāpaṇa,</i> then the nearest we can get to a translation at present is "gold coins." This seems a more likely translation than "gold leaf" (which so far as I know has never been suggested). <i>Hirañña</i> is undoubtedly connected with <i>hari,</i> meaning "yellow, yellowish, green, greenish," and I find that in the <i>Ency. Brit,</i> it is said of gold that "while in very thin leaves it transmits a greenish light." Before the days when it was fashionable to plaster stupas and images of the Buddha with gold-leaf, it is not, however, very likely that this substance would have been used in any large quantities. Rich people would have been more apt to have "heaps of gold coins." Although more Pali literature is available to us than was to Rhys Davids, we must still say with him (<i>Ancient Coins</i>, etc., p. 5) that "to decide these points we must have more texts before us."</p>

"In this meaning <i>pārājika</i> exists for those people for whom there is an offence <i>(āpatti)</i> against the training. Whoever transgresses against the course of training, it defeats him <i>(parājeti),</i> therefore it is called a defeat. Whoever commits an offence, that defeats him, therefore that is called a defeat. The man, inasmuch as defeated, fallen on defeat, is thereby called a defeated one."

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n187" href="#fn187">187</a>]</sup> <i>Thig.,</i> ver. 224 <i>ff.</i> <i>ThigA.</i> 190; <i>DhA.</i> II 48 ff. and <i>AA.</i> I 355-356 all relate how she had power in the sphere of light {cf. Dabba, in <i>Saṇgh.</i> VIII. below), and say that she was born at Sāvatthī in the family of a great merchant. <i>DhA.</i> II 49 tells much the same story as that given above, her assaulter there being a young kinsman, and it says that she went into the Dark Wood, because at that time forest-dwelling for nuns had not been forbidden. In <i>Nissaggiya</i> V she is also said to have entered the Dark Wood. There is no doubt, I think, that the Uppalavaṇṇā of <i>Vin.</i> III 35 above and of <i>DhA.</i> are one and the same. That the Uppalavaṇṇā of <i>Thig.</i> is the same is less likely. For though some of the thoughts there attributed to her might be construed to be the outcome of her adventures, the main episode of her life as represented in <i>Thig.,</i> is that of being her mother's co-wife. Nothing is said of this surely very unusual situation in either <i>DhA.</i> or <i>AA.</i> <i>VA.</i> gives no story. It may be that <i>DhA.</i> and <i>AA.</i> have welded the story of the two Uppalavaṇṇās into one story. Such a welding of two stories into one has a parallel in the story of Kisāgotamī, <i>Pss. Sisters,</i> p. 109, witb which <i>cf.</i> the story of Paṭācārā, <i>Pss. Sisters,</i> p. 70. At <i>AN</i> I 24 Uppalavaṇṇā is called chief of the disciples who are nuns having psychic potencies; and at <i>AN</i> I 88 she and Khemā are taken as the standard and measure by which to estimate the disciples who are nuns.

The <i>Comy.</i> on this passage, <i>VA.</i> 475 gives <i>akkamitvā</i> in explanation of <i>ottharitvā,</i> which seems to mean "sitting on." Tr. <i>Cr.

The question is, does the text of the above passage justify the Dictionary's rendering? It is as easy to believe that the monk was merely returning to his former home as that he was declaring his intention of returning to his former wife. On the other hand, on p. 62 below, <i>vibbhama</i> possibly means "cohabit." At p. 323 below, <i>vibbhº</i> probably means "left the Order." Doubtless this meaning carried the other with it.
