					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a> in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nandiya the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, if an Ariyan disciple is<br />
					in every way,<br />
					altogether,<br />
					<a id="pg341"><span class="f2 g"><b>[341]</b></span></a> in every respect<br />
					and utterly,<br />
					without the four limbs of stream-winning,<br />
					can he in such case be called<br />
					'An Ariyan disciple who lives remiss?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of such an one, Nandiya, who<br />
					in every way,<br />
					altogether,<br />
					in every respect<br />
					and utterly,<br />
					without the four limbs of stream-winning,<br />
					I declare him to be one who stands without,<br />
					in the ranks of the manyfolk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Nandiya, I will tell you<br />
					how the Ariyan disciple is one who lives remiss<br />
					and one who lives in earnest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, lord,"<br />
					replied Nandiya the Sakyan to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Nandiya, is the Ariyan disciple<br />
					one who dwells remiss?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is content with that unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					but he makes no further effort,<br />
					either to get seclusion by day<br />
					or meditation by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus dwells remiss<br />
					he has no delight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without delight in a thing<br />
					there is no zest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Zest lacking,<br />
					there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without calm<br />
					one dwells in discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who dwells in discomfort<br />
					the mind is not tranquillized.</p>

					the teachings do not show clear.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the teachings being obscure to him<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, suppose the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />

					walking uprightly,<br />
