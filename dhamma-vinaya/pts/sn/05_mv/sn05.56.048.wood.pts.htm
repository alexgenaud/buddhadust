					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, this mighty earth<br />
					were one mass of water,<br />
					and a man were to throw down thereon<br />
					a yoke with one hole.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then comes a wind from the east<br />
					and wafts it west,<br />
					and a wind from the west<br />
					wafts it east:<br />
					a north wind wafts it south<br />
					and a south wind wafts it north.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then once at the end of a hundred years<br />
					a blind turtle pops up to the surface.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that blind turtle<br />
					push his neck through<br />
					that yoke with one hole<br />
					whenever he popped up to the surface<br />
					at the end of a hundred years?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is unlikely,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lord,<br />
					that the blind turtle would do that."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is just as unlikely, monks,<br />
					that one will get birth in human form,<br />
					just as unhkely<br />
					that a Tathāgata should arise in the world,<br />
					an Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One;<br />
					just as unlikely, monks,<br />
					that the Norm and Discipline proclaimed by a Tathāgata<br />
					should be shown in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now indeed, monks,<br />
					this state of human birth is won,<br />
					and a Tathāgata has arisen in the world,<br />
					and the Norm and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata<br />
					is shown in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
