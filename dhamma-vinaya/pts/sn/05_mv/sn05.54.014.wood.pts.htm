<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 5 Maha Vagga, Samyutta 54, Sutta 14. The Buddha poses a riddle: Is there one state which completes four; four that complete seven; and seven that complete two. The answer is that minding respiration completes the four arisings of mind, the four arisings of mind completes the seven dimensions of self-awakening; the seven dimensions of self-awakening completes knowledge and vision." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this to Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Ānanda, is there any one state<br />
					which, if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					brings four states to completion?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do four states,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete seven states?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do seven states,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete two states?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br />
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br />
					of what he has just uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">There is one state<br />
					which does complete four.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four states complete seven,<br />
					and seven complete two.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, Ānanda,<br />
					is the one state<br />
					which, if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					brings the four arisings of mindfulness to completion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					bring the seven limbs of wisdom to completion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete knowledge and release.</p>

					<p class="ctr">I</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated,<br />
					how made much of,<br />
					does intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					complete the four arisings of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this method, Ānanda,<br />
					a monk who has gone to the forest<br />
					or the foot of a tree<br />
					or a lonely place,<br />
					sits down cross-legged,<br />
					holding the body straight.<br />
					Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br />
					he breathes in mindfully<br />
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br />
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br />
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling the thrill of zest<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br />
					I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aware of all mental factors<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, at such time as a monk,<br />
					while drawing in a long breath,<br />
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, breathing out a long breath,<br />
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I breathe out';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when drawing in a short breath,<br />
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when breathing out a short breath,<br />
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I breathe out';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when he makes up his mind<br />
					(repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Feeling it go through the whole body<br />

					feeling it go through the whole body<br />
					I shall breathe out;<br />

					I shall breathe out,' —</p>

					<p class="f4">at such time, Ānanda,<br />
					in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient)<br />
					a monk dwells ardent,<br />
					self-possessed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, I declare<br />
					that this in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					is a certain body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, a monk,<br />

					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare, Ānanda,<br />
					that the practice of intent concentration<br />
					on in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					is not a mindfulness that is relaxed<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, I say<br />

					<p class="f4">Abandoning whatever dejection arises from coveting,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore I say, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Ānanda,<br />
