					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk came to see the Exalted One<br />
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One should teach me a teaching in brief,<br />
					hearing which teaching from the Exalted One<br />
					I might dwell solitary,<br />
					remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, monk, you must purify the rudiments in good states.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monk, abandoning wrong conduct in body,<br />
					do you cultivate right conduct in body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise, abandoning wrong conduct in speech,<br />
					you should cultivate right conduct in speech.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning wrong conduct in mind,<br />
					you should cultivate right conduct in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monk, abandoning wrong conduct in body,<br />
					cultivating right conduct in body<br />
					abandoning wrong conduct in speech,<br />
					cultivating right conduct in speech<br />
					abandoning wrong conduct in mind,<br />
					cultivating right conduct in mind,<br />
					leaning on virtue,<br />
					established in virtue,<br />
					you should cultivate four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> Herein a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monk, when you,<br />
					leaning on virtue<br />
					and established in virtue,<br />
					shall have thus cultivated the four stations of mindfulness, -<br />
					then, monk, you may look for that increase in good states<br />
					which shall come to you,<br />
					whether by night or by day,<br />
					and not for decrease in good states."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk was delighted with the words of the Exalted One<br />
					and not long after,<br />
					dwelling solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br />
					to win which<br />
					the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br />
					to the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that in that very life,<br />
					of himself,<br />
					he fully understood it,<br />
					realized it<br />
					and abode therein,<br />
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter."</p>

					<p class="f4">And that monk was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
