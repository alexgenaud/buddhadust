					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever Arahants,<br />
					fully enlightened ones,<br />
					in past time<br />
					had full understanding (of things)<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					all of them had full understanding<br />
					of the four Ariyan truths<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br />
					fully enlightened ones,<br />
					shall in future time<br />
					have full understandmg of things<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					all of them will have full understanding<br />
					of the four Ariyan truths<br />
					as they reñlly are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br />
					fully enlightened ones,<br />
					do now fully understand things<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					all of them have full understanding<br />
					of the four Ariyan truths<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth about Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth about the arising of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth about about the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever Arahants,<br />
					fully enlightened ones,<br />
					in past time<br />
					had full understanding (of things)<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					all of them had full understanding<br />
					of the four Ariyan truths<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br />
					fully enlightened ones,<br />
					shall in future time<br />
					have full understandmg of things<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					all of them will have full understanding<br />
					of the four Ariyan truths<br />
					as they reñlly are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Arahants,<br />
					fully enlightened ones,<br />
					do now fully understand things<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					all of them have full understanding<br />
					of the four Ariyan truths<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
