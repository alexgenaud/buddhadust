					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.55.052.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion a certain monk<br />
					who had just spent the rainy season near Sāvatthī,<br />
					had come to Kapilavatthu<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard it said<br />
					that a certain monk<br />
					who had spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī<br />
					was come to Kapilavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					went to visit that monk,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the Sakyans said this to that monk:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, is the Exalted One well and strong?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is, friends."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, are Sāriputta and Moggallāna<br />
					well and strong?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are, friends."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, is the Order of Monks well and strong?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg347"><span class="f2 g"><b>[347]</b></span></a> "They are, friends."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, during this retreat of the rainy season,<br />
					have you beard anything<br />
					face to face with the Exalted One?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you learned anything from him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friends. I have heard<br />
					and learned this<br />
					face to face with the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks, few indeed are those monks,<br />
					who, by destroying the āsavas,<br />
					have of themselves<br />
					in this very life<br />
					by their own knowledge<br />
					realized the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight,<br />
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">More numerous are those monks<br />
					who, by destroying the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					are reborn spontaneously<br />
					(in the higher worlds),<br />
					there to pass utterly away,<br />
					destined not to return from that world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, friends, I heard this<br />
					face to face with the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks, few indeed are those monks<br />
					who, by destroying the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					are reborn spontaneously<br />
					(in the higher worlds),<br />
					there to pass utterly away,<br />
					not destined to return from that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">More numerous are those monks<br />
					who, by destroying three fetters<br />
					and wearing down lust,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and delusiön,<br />
					are Once-returners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Coming back once more to this world<br />
					they will make an end of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, friends, I learned this<br />
					face to face with the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks, few are those monks<br />
					who, by destroying three fetters<br />
					and wearing down lust,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and delusion,<br />
					are Once-returners,<br />
					who, coming back once more to this world,<br />
					shall make an end of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">More numerous are those monks<br />
					who, by destroying three fetters,<br />
					are Stream-winners,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					bound for enlightenment.'"</p>
