					<p class="f4">Now at that time the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika was sick,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> That's what it says, but in other cases of this sort it is usually: "Say to him: 'So-and-so bows with his head at the feet of and say ~'". And this would be repeated by the messinger. Sometimes the messinger is to bow at the feet as here, and then he does so. Here either the messinger or the repeater is lax. In those days, depending on the person to whom the message was being delivered, it could mean the loss of one's head (or worse, exceedingly cruel tortures) to make a mistake like this.</p>
