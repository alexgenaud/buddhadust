					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika was sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika called to a certain man, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, good fellow!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you to the venerable Sāriputta,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then he went to see the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> That's what it says, but in other cases of this sort it is usually: "Say to him: 'So-and-so bows with his head at the feet of and say ~'". And this would be repeated by the messinger. Sometimes the messinger is to bow at the feet as here, and then he does so. Here either the messinger or the repeater is lax. In those days, depending on the person to whom the message was being delivered, it could mean the loss of one's head (or worse, exceedingly cruel tortures) to make a mistake like this.</p>
