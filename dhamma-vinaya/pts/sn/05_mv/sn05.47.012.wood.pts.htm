					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nālandā,</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in Clothseller's Mango Grove.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I have such faith in the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">There never was, methinks,<br />
					nor shall be,<br />
					nor is there now existing<br />
					anyone, whether recluse or brahmin,<br />
					who is greater<br />
					or more accomplished,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is, in the higher wisdom!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Splendid,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> indeed, Sāriputta,<br />
					is your bull-like utterance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">You have laid hold of certainty.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">You have uttered a lion's roar,<br />
					in saying as you do,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord I have such faith in the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">There never was, methinks,<br />
					nor shall be,<br />
					nor is there now existing<br />
					anyone, whether recluse or brahmin,<br />
					who is greater<br />
					or more accomplished;<br />
					that is, in the higher wisdom!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who in past time were Arahants,<br />
					fully Enlightened Ones, -<br />
					pray, have you seen<br />
					mind to mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with all those Exalted Ones<br />
					(so as to say of them):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such was the virtue of those Exalted Ones,<br />
					such the teachings of those Exalted Ones,<br />
					such their wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus they dwelt<br />
					and thus those Exalted Ones were released'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> Then again, Sāriputta,<br />
					those who shall be Arahants,<br />
					fully Enlightened Ones<br />
					in future times, -<br />
					pray, have you seen<br />
					mind to mind<br />
					with all those Exalted Ones,<br />
					so as to say of them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such was the virtue of those Exalted Ones,<br />
					such the teachings of those Exalted Ones,<br />
					such their wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus they dwelt<br />
					and thus those Exalted Ones were released'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, Sāriputta,<br />
					he who is now Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One, -<br />
					pray, is he seen<br />
					mind to mind<br />
					by you (so that you can say of him):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is the virtue of the Exalted One,<br />
					such his teaching,<br />
					such his wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus and thus he dwells,<br />
					thus is that Exalted One released'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So then, Sāriputta,<br />
					in this matter<br />
					you have no power of seeing<br />
					mind to mind<br />
					with these Arahants,<br />
					these fully Enlightened Ones,<br />
					whether in past or future or present time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then, Sāriputta,<br />
					is the meaning of your splendid bulllike utterance,<br />
					your laying hold of certainty,<br />
					your uttering of the lion's roar,<br />
					in saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I have such faith in the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">There never was, methinks,<br />
					nor shall be,<br />
					nor is there now existing<br />
					anyone, whether recluse or brahmin,<br />
					who is greater<br />
					or more accomplished;<br />
					that is, in the higher wisdom'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"True it is, lord,<br />
					as to those Arahants,<br />
					those fully Enlightened Ones,<br />
					whether in time past or future or present,<br />
					I have no power of seeing<br />
					mind to mind with them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I only infer<br />
					from my knowledge<br />
					which is in accordance with the Norm.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, lord, there is a border town<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with strong foundations,<br />
					strong walls and towers,<br />
					but a single gate,<br />
					and over that is set a warden,<br />
					wise,<br />
					shrewd<br />
					and watchful,<br />
					who keeps out strangers<br />
					and welcomes friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he patrols all round that town<br />
					in order due<br />
					he might not mark a crevice in the <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> wall<br />
					or a hole just big enough for a cat to slip through,<br />
					but he would think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever creatures of any size<br />
					enter this town<br />
					or go out therefrom,<br />
					all of them must enter<br />
					or go out<br />
					by this same gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, lord, is my inference<br />
					from knowledge in accordance with the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those, lord, who in time past were Arahants,<br />
					fully Enlightened Ones, -<br />
					all of those Exalted Ones,<br />
					by abandoning the five hindrances,<br />
					those corruptions of the heart<br />
					that weaken insight,<br />
					being well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					by cultivating in very truth<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					did attain enlightenment<br />
					in the unsurpassed perfect wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">They, lord, who in future time,<br />
					will be fully Enlightened Ones, -<br />
					all of those Exalted Ones,<br />
					by abandoning the five hindrances,<br />
					those corruptions of the heart<br />
					that weaken insight,<br />
					being well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					by cultivating in very truth<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					will attain enlightenment<br />
					in the unsurpassed perfect wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One, lord,<br />
					who even now is Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					by abandoning the five hindrances,<br />
					those corruptions of the heart<br />
					which weaken insight,<br />
					he, well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					by cultivating in very truth<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					is enlightened with the unsurpassed perfect wisdom."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Sāriputta,<br />
					you should repeat this Norm-teaching<br />
					again and again<br />
					to monks and nuns,<br />
					to disciples,<br />
					both men and women;<br />
					and whatsoever silly fellows<br />
					have any doubt or perplexity about the Tathāgata,<br />
					when they hear my method of Norm-teaching,<br />
					all such doubt and perplexity<br />
					shall be abandoned.'</p>
