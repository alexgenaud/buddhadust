					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you, monks, the way concerned with penetration.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is that way?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is equinimity."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the venerable Udāyī said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, how cultivated,<br />
					how made much of, do these seven limbs of wisdom conduce to penetration??</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Udayi, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that <a id="pg74"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span></a> is mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender;<br />
					which is far-spreading,<br />
					lofty,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					free of malevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, with mind that has cultivated the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br />
