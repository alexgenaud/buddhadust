					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, that a man lays together<br />
					on the mighty earth<br />
					seven balls of clay<br />
					as big as kola-stones.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br />
					those balls of clay as big as kola-stones,<br />
					thus laid together,<br />
					or this mighty earth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, this mighty earth is the greater.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exceeding small<br />
					are the balls of clay<br />
					as big as kola-stones:<br />
					they cannot be reckoned,<br />
					they cannot be compared therewith.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not amount to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of this mighty earth, -<br />
					those balls of clay<br />
					as big as kola-stones."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br />
					for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br />
					for the person who has understanding,<br />
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up,<br />
					and infinitely small<br />
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of it<br />
					when set beside that Ill<br />
					which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up, -<br />
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br />
					for the man who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
