					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a><br />
					in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					a number of monks were busied<br />
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br />
					"for," said they,<br />
					"when the rains are over,<br />
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan heard it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A number of monks are busied<br />
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br />
					'for,' said they,<br />
					'when the rains are over,<br />
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds'"<br />
					and he went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					Mahanama the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hear it said, lord,<br />
					that a number of monks are busied<br />
					making robes for the Exalted One<br />
					with the idea that,<br />
					when the rains are over,<br />
					the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, we have never heard<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from the Exalted One's own lips<br />
					how a discreet<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lay-disciple who is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease,<br />
					should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A discreet lay-disciple, Mahānāma,<br />
					who is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease,<br />
					should be admonished by another discreet lay-disciple<br />
					with the four comfortable assurances,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Take comfort, dear sir,<br />
					in your unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir, in your unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir,<br />
					in your unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Take comfort, dear sir, in your possession of the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A discreet lay-disciple, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, supposing he has longing for his parents,<br />
