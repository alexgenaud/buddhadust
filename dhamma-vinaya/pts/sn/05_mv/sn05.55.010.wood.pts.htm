					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />

					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />

					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is that Norm-teaching<br />
