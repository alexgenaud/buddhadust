					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans,<br />

					<p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br />

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br />

					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br />
					Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>
