					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vajjians">Vajjians</a> at Koṭigāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					understand not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'This is Ill';<br />
					who understand not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill';<br />
					who understand not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill';<br />
					who understand not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill', -<br />
					such are not reckoned as recluses<br />
					among recluses<br />
					nor as brahmins<br />
					among brahmins,<br />
					nor have those worthies,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					of themselves realized<br />
					by their own knowledge<br />
					the reality of recluseship<br />
					or of brahminhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">But whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					have understood,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'This is Ill';<br />
					who have understood,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill';<br />
					who have understood,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill';<br />
					who have understood,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill', -<br />
					such are not reckoned as recluses<br />

					nor have those worthies,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					of themselves realized<br />
					by their own knowledge<br />
					the reality of recluseship<br />
					or of brahminhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having thus spoken<br />
					the Happy One added this as Teacher:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Who understand not Ill, and how Ill comes to be,<br />
							And how Ill ceases utterly without remains,<br />
							Nor know the Way that leads on to Ill's ending,<br />
							Such lack the heart's release, they lack release by insight.<br />
							Helpless to make an end, to birth and eld they go.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">But understanding Ill and how Ill comes to be,<br />
							And where Ill ceases utterly without remains,<br />
							Knowing the Way that leads on to Ill's ending,<br />
							Blessed with the heart's release, blessed with release by insight,<br />
							They, able to end all, go not to birth and eld.</p>
