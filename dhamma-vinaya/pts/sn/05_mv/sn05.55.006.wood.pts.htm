					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One<br />
					was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					a number of monks were busied<br />
					with making a robe for the Exalted One,<br />
					with this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">When the robe is finished,<br />
					in three months' time,<br />
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br />
					were staying at Sadhuka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say that a number of monks<br />
					are busied with making a robe for the Exalted One<br />
					with this idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the robe is finished,<br />
					in three months' time,<br />
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br />
					stationed a man on the high-road<br />
					(thus instructing him):</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, good fellow,<br />
					as soon as you see that Exalted one,<br />
					that Arahant,<br />
					that perfectly Enlightened One<br />
					coming along,<br />
					do you ecme and inform us."</p>

					<p class="f4">So after standing there two or three days<br />
					that man saw the Exalted One coming along,<br />
					while yet some distance off,<br />
					and he went to inform the chamberlains, Isidatta and Purāṇa,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here comes my lord the Exalted One,<br />
					that Arahant,<br />
					that perfectly Enlightened One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now's the time for you to do what you want!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br />
					went towards the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and followed behind the Exalted One<br />
					step for step.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One turned aside from the high-road<br />
					and went to the foot of a certain tree<br />
					and there sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Isidatta and Purāṇa, the chamberlains,<br />
					<a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> saluting the Exalted One,<br />

					at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />

					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
