					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four deva-paths to the Devas,<br />
					for the purification of impure beings,<br />
					for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpsassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first deva-path to the Devas,<br />
					for the purification of impure beings,<br />
					for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, he has unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second deva-path to the Devas,<br />
					for the purification of impure beings,<br />
					for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, he has unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third deva-path to the Devas,<br />
					for the purification of impure beings,<br />
					for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the Ariyan disciple blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[He thus reflects:</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"What then is this deva-path to the devas?"</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>He understands thus:</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"I have heard that non-malevolence is at present the held by devas to be most excellent,<br />
					and then abandoned by me is malevolence towards,<br />
					weak or sturdy.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Surely I live the deva-path Dhamma.</i>]<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth deva-path to the Devas,<br />
					for the purification of impure beings,<br />
					for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four deva-paths to the Devas,<br />
					for the purification of impure beings,<br />
					for the cleansing of foul beings.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward has erroneously omitted this paragraph. I have done a rough translation a hybrid Woodward/Olds/Bhk. Bodhi thing. Bhk. Bodhi has: <i>"He reflects thus: 'What now is the divine track of the devas?' He understnds thus: 'I have heard that at present the devas hold non-oppression as supreme, and I do not oppress anyone, frail or firm. Surely I dwell possessing one of the divine tracks'"</i></p>
