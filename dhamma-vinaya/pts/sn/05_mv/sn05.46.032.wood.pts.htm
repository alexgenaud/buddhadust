<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya V: Maha Vagga; Chapter 46: Bojjhanga Samyutta, Sutta 32. The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that whatever is skillful is based on tracing things back to their place of origin and tracing things back to their place of origin is considered the most skillful of skillful things. He then tells them that one who traces things back to their place of origin will develop the seven dimensions of awakening." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever conditions, monks,<br />
					are the constituent parts of good and bad,<br />
					but are on the side of goodness,<br />
					all of them have their root in systematic attention,<br />
					converge in systematic attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those conditions<br />
					systematic attention is reckoned chief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who possesses systematic attention<br />
					we may expect that he will cultivate<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					that he will make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br />
					who is possessed of systematic attention<br />
					cultivate and make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is energy,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is zest,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is tranquillity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is concentration,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is equanimity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk<br />
					who is possessed of systematic attention<br />
					cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
