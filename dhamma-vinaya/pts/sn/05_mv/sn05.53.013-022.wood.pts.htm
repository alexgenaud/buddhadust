					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />

					that one-pointedness of mind,<br />

					zestful and easeful,<br />
					which is the second trance,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br />
