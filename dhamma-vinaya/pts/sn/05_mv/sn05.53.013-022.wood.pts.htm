					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third trance,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, of all starry bodies whatsoever<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, aloof from sensuality,<br />
					aloof from evil states,<br />
					enters on the first trance<br />

					born of solitude,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					he enters on that inward calm,<br />
					that one-pointedness of mind,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					which is the second trance,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br />
					he abides indifferent,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third trance,<br />
					which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,' -<br />
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br />
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of the happiness and unhappiness that he had before,<br />
					entering on that state which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br />
					that utter purity of mindfulness reached by indifference,<br />
					which is the fourth trance,<br />
