					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					taking up a little dust<br />
					on the tip of his finger-nail,<br />
					said to the monks:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think ye, monks?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater,<br />
					this little dust I have taken up<br />
					on the tip of my finger-nail,<br />
					or this mighty earth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Greater, lord, is this mighty earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exceeding small<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is this little dust taken up<br />
					on the tip of the Exalted One's fingernail:<br />
					it cannot be reckoned,<br />
					it cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of it<br />
					when set beside the mighty earth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					this little dust taken up<br />
					on the tip of the Exalted One's finger-nail."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br />
					for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br />
					for the person who has understanding,<br />
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up,<br />
					and infinitely small<br />
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of it<br />
					when set beside that Ill<br />
					which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up, -<br />
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br />
					for the man who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
