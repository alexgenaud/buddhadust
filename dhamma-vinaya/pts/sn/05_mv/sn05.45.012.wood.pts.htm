					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I desire to dwell in solitude<br />
					for three months.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not to be visited by any<br />
					save by him alone who brings my food."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord"<br />
					replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One<br />
					save the one who brought his food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One,<br />
					leaving his solitude,<br />
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I have been dwelling partly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the same manner as I did<br />
					after I first attamed enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I came to know<br />
