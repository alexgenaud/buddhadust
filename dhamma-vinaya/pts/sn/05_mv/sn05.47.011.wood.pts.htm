					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika</a>'s Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Sāriputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"A superman, a superman,"<br />
					is the saying, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far is one a superman?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is by emancipation of mind, Sāriputta,<br />
					that I call a man<br />
					"superman."</p>

					<p class="f4">Without emancipation of mind<br />
					there is no superman, I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Sāriputta, is one's mind emancipated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, a monk abides in body contemplating body (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in body contemplating body,<br />
					his mind is purified,<br />
					emancipated,<br />
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abides in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in feelings contemplating feelings,<br />
					his mind is purified,<br />
					emancipated,<br />
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abides in mind contemplating mind (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in mind contemplating mind,<br />
					his mind is purified,<br />
					emancipated,<br />
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abides in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining that dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he so abides in mind-states contemplating mind-states,<br />
					his mind is purified,<br />
					emancipated,<br />
					by freedom from the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Sāriputta, is one's mind emancipated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta, it is by emancipation of mind<br />
					tbat I call a man<br />
					"superman."</p>

					<p class="f4">Without this emancipation of mind<br />
					there is no superman, I declare.'</p>

							<p><i>Mahāpuriso.</i> The term is found also in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.030.pali.bd.htm#mahapuriso">AN 8.30,</a> where it is being addressed to Anuruddha (who was not a Brahmin) and appears to be being used as a technical term in the Buddhist doctrine. One suspects that Woodward's effort here to distance the Doctrine from this term was because of it's current (then) association with Hitler's Nazism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> I borrow this term from <i>Dialog.</i> iii, 134, q v. <i>Cf. A.</i> 11, 35; <i>Dhp.</i> 352. <i>Comy.</i> has no remarks on this <i>sutta.</i> At <i>D. loc. cit.</i> the editors remark: 'These are the only passages in "the sixteen volumes of the <i>Four Nikāyas</i> in which the word has so far been traced. This is sufficient to show that the word (<i>mahāpuriso</i>) is not in use as a technical term in the Buddhist doctrine. It occurs only when the brahmin use of the term is referred to (Sāriputta was a brahmin), and is there used to show the startling contrast between the brahmin and the Buddhist conceptions of what a superman must be.' <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Sn.</i> 1040.</p>
