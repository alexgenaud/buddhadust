					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brahmin came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously and,<br />
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the condition, master Gotama,<br />
					what is the cause,<br />
					why, after the final passing away of the Tathāgata,<br />
					the good Norm does not last long;<br />
					and again, master Gotama,<br />
					what is the condition,<br />
					what the cause,<br />
					why, after the final passing away of the Tathāgata,<br />
					the good Norm does last long?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is owing to not cultivating, brahmin,<br />
					owing to not making much of<br />
					four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					that the good Norm does not last long<br />
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to cultivating, brahmin,<br />
					owing to making much of<br />
					four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					that the good Norm lasts long<br />
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to not cultivating, brahmin,<br />
					owing to not making much of<br />
					these four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					that the good Norm does not last long<br />
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to cultivating, brahmin,<br />
					owing to making much of<br />
					these four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					that the good Norm lasts long<br />
					after the final passing away of the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should lift up the fallen,<br />
					discover the hidden,<br />
					point out the way to the bewildered,<br />
					show a light in the gloom, saying:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now they that have eyes to see||<br />
					can see objects,' -|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">even so in divers ways<br />
					has the Exalted One expounded the truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord,<br />
					do go for refuge to the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as his follower,<br />
					as one who has taken refuge in him,<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as my life shall last."</p>
