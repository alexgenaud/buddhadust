					or kinsmen<br />
					or blood relatives<br />
					were to come to a monk<br />
					who is cultivating and making much of the Axiyan eightfold way,<br />
					and were to seek to entice him with wealth, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should these yellow robes torment you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why parade about with shaven crown and bowl?</p>

					<p class="f4">Come!</p>

					<p class="f4">Return to the lower life<br />
					and enjoy possessions<br />
					and do deeds of merit,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">for that monk<br />
					so cultivating and making much of the four stations of mindfulness<br />
					return to the lower life is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, that monk's heart<br />
					has for many a long day<br />
					been bent on detachment,<br />
					inclined to detachment,<br />
					turned towards detachment,<br />
					so that there is no possibility<br />
					for him to return to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br />
					cultivate and make much of the four stations of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body in a contemplaton of body<br />
					which plunges into the deathless,<br />
					which has the deathless for its aim,<br />
					which has the deathless for its end;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in feelings in a contemplaton of feelings<br />
					which plunges into the deathless,<br />
					which has the deathless for its aim,<br />
					which has the deathless for its end;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind in a contemplaton of mind<br />
					which plunges into the deathless,<br />
					which has the deathless for its aim,<br />
					which has the deathless for its end;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind-states in a contemplaton of mind-states<br />
					which plunges into the deathless,<br />
					which has the deathless for its aim,<br />
					which has the deathless for its end.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how monks, a monk cultivates and makes much of the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">iv. Ending in Nibbāna</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, the river Ganges,<br />
					that flows,<br />
					slides<br />
					and tends towards the east,<br />
					and there comes a great crowd of folk,<br />
					armed with pick and basket, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will make this river Ganges<br />
					flow,<br />
					slide<br />
					and tend towards the west.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that great crowd of folk<br />
					make the river Ganges<br />
					flow,<br />
					slide<br />
					and tend towards the west?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And why not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, lord, the river Ganges<br />
					flows,<br />
					slides<br />
					and tends towards the east,<br />
					it were no easy thing<br />
					to make it flow,<br />
					slide<br />
					and tend towards the west;<br />
					insomuch that fatigue and vexation<br />
					would be the lot<br />
					of that great crowd of folk."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, monks, if the rajah's royal ministers<br />
					or his friends<br />
					or boon companions<br />
					or kinsmen<br />
					or blood relatives<br />
					were to come to a monk<br />
					who is cultivating and making much of the Axiyan eightfold way,<br />
					and were to seek to entice him with wealth, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should these yellow robes torment you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why parade about with shaven crown and bowl?</p>

					<p class="f4">Come!</p>

					<p class="f4">Return to the lower life<br />
					and enjoy possessions<br />
					and do deeds of merit,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">for that monk<br />
					so cultivating and making much of the four stations of mindfulness<br />
					return to the lower life is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, that monk's heart<br />

					been bent on detachment,<br />
					inclined to detachment,<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br />
					cultivate and make much of the four stations of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in body in a contemplaton of body<br />
					which flows to Nibbāna,<br />
					which slides to Nibbāna,<br />
					which tends to Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in feelings in a contemplaton of feelings<br />
					which flows to Nibbāna,<br />
					which slides to Nibbāna,<br />
					which tends to Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind in a contemplaton of mind<br />
					which flows to Nibbāna,<br />
					which slides to Nibbāna,<br />
					which tends to Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind-states in a contemplaton of mind-states<br />
					which flows to Nibbāna,<br />
					which slides to Nibbāna,<br />
