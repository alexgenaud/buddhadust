					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Without penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />
					without penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br />

					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					without penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					I will make an utter end of Ill'<br />
					it would be an impossibility for him to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will make a leaf-basket<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of acacia leaves<br />
					or of Judas-tree leaves<br />
					or of myrobalan leaves,<br />
					and fetch water in it,<br />
					or use them for a fan,'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it would be impossible for him to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so<br />
					for him to make an utter end of Ill<br />
					without<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />

					the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					would be an impossibility.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will make an utter end of Ill by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />
					by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br />
					by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,'<br />
					I will make an utter end of Ill'<br />
					it could be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will make a leaf-basket<br />
					of lotus-leaves<br />
					or pulasa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> leaves<br />
					or creeper leaves,<br />
					or make a fan of them,'<br />
					it could be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also if one were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will make an utter end of Ill by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />
					by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br />
					by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					by penetrating,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill,'<br />
					I will make an utter end of Ill'<br />
					it could be done</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
