					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six sense-faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br />
					the sense-faculty of ear,<br />
					the sense-faculty of nose,<br />
					the sense-faculty of tongue,<br />
					the sense-faculty of body<br />
					the sense-faculty of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the six sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the arising<br />
					and the perishing of,<br />
					the satisfaction in,<br />
					the misery of,<br />
					and the escape from<br />
					these six faculties of sense,<br />
					such are not worthy to be accounted<br />
					as recluses among recluses<br />
					nor as brahmins among brahmins,<br />

					or even in this life realized,<br />
					the goal of recluseship<br />
					or of brahminhood,<br />
					nor do they dwell in the attainment of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses and brahmins who do understand,<br />
