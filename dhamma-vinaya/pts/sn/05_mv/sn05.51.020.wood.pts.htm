					as by night, so by day'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br />
					in cultivating the basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are investigation,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration and struggle,<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, with wits alert,<br />
					with wits unhampered,<br />
					does a monk cultivate his mind to brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk's consciousness of light<br />
					is well grasped,<br />
					his consciousness of daylight<br />
					is well sustained.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he cultivates his mind to brilliancy.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, monks,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power<br />
					are of great fruit,<br />
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by means of the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					thus cultivated<br />
					and thus made much of,<br />
					that a monk enjoys<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					manifold farms of magic power,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if it were through air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water.</p>

					<p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it,<br />
					as if on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br />
					like a bird upon the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br />
					though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br />
					he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br />
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					with deva-power of hearing,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br />
					he hears sounds<br />
					both of devas and of humans,<br />
					whether far or near.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					he knows the minds of other beings,<br />
					of other persons,<br />
					with his own mind grasping them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is lustful<br />
					he knows it to lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from lust<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is free from lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is full of hate<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is full of hate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from hate<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is free from hate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is deluded<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is deluded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from delusion<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is cramped<br />

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is released<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is released.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					he calls to mind his former births in divers ways thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					even ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births;<br />
					even a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind divers aeons of involution<br />
					divers aeons of evolution,<br />
					diverse aeons of involution and evolution.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such was I by name,<br />
					such was I by clan,<br />
					by caste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was I nourished,<br />
					thus did I undergo pleasure and pain,<br />
					such was my span of life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thence I deceased<br />
					and rose up so and so.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I dwelt,<br />
					of such and such a name,<br />
					of such a clan,<br />
					of such a caste,<br />
					so nourished;<br />
					such and such pleasure and pain did I undergo,<br />
					such my span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence deceased<br />
					I rose up in the present life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how<br />
					in fact and detail<br />
					he calls to mind in divers ways<br />
					his former births.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					with the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br />
					he beholds beings:<br />
					as they decease and rise up (elsewhere)<br />
					he knows them,<br />
					both mean and exalted,<br />
					of features fair and foul,<br />
					gone to weal<br />
					or gone to woe,<br />
					according to their deeds, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! these good folk,<br />
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br />
					of evil words,<br />
					of evil thoughts,<br />
					scoffing at the noble ones,<br />
					of perverted views<br />
					and reaping the fruit of their perverted views, -<br />
					these folk,<br />
					on the dissolution of body,<br />
					after death arose again in the Waste,<br />
					the Downfall<br />
					and the Constant Round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah! and these good folk,<br />
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br />
					of good words,<br />
					of good thoughts,<br />
					not scoffing at the noble ones,<br />
					of sound views<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					on the dissolution of body,<br />
					after death arose again in the Happy Way,<br />
					the Heaven World.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br />
					does he behold beings<br />
					as they decease and rise up (elsewhere):<br />
					he knows them,<br />
					both mean and exalted,<br />
					of features fair and foul,<br />
					gone to weal<br />
					or gone to woe<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, it is by cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					these four bases of psychic power<br />
					tha a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					by his own unaided powers<br />
					attains the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight,<br />
					that is free from the āsavas,<br />
					realizes it<br />
					and dwells therein."</p>
