					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the housefather Sirivaḍḍha was sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Sirivaḍḍha called to a certain man, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come bither, good man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you go to the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on coming to him,<br />
					in my name bowing down at his feet,<br />
					say this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master, the housefather Sirivaḍḍha is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He bows down at the feet of the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, master,<br />
					if the venerable Ānanda would come<br />
					to the dwelling of the housefather Sirivaḍḍha,<br />
					out of compassion for him."'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, sir," said that man,<br />
					in reply to the housefather Sirivaḍḍha,<br />
					and went to where the venerable Ānanda was staying.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming there,<br />
					he saluted the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As be thus sat<br />
					that man said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master, the housefather Sirivaḍḍha is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He bows down at the feet of the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and begs that he will visit his dwelling,<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda assented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					robing himself<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					set off for the dwelling of the housefather Sirivaddha,<br />
					and on coming there<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having sat down,<br />
					he said this to the housefather Sirivaddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you <a id="pg156"><span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span></a> are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br />
					and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br />
					and not increasing?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sir, I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, housefather,<br />
					thus must you train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will abide in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will abide in feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will abide in mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will abide in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is how you must train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, as to those four stations of mindfulness<br />
					taught by the Exalted One,<br />
					they do exist in me, -<br />
					those conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do live conformably with those conditions.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I do abide, lord, in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do abide, lord, in feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do abide, lord, in mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do abide, lord, in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, as to those five fetters of the lower sort<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					shown by the Exalted One,<br />
					I do not see a single one of them in myself<br />
					that is not abandoned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good for you, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten by you, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">You have declared the fruits of not returning, housefather!"</p>
