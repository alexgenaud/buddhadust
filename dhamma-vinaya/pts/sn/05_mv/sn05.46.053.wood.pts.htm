<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga: 53. The exact similarity in the outward form of the practices of a group of ascetics with one method of instruction used by The Buddha leads to the question of what is the difference between the two sects. The Buddha reveals an interpretation of the doctrine unique to the understanding of the awakened mind, inaccesable through any other source." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now a number of monks,<br />
					robing themselves in the forenoon,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					set off for Sāvatthī to beg for food.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it occurred to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is full early to go to Sāvatthī to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we pay a visit<br />
					to the Park of the Wanderers who hold other views."</p>

					<p class="f4">So those monks went there<br />
					and on coming to them<br />
					courteously greeted the Wanderers of other views,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and civilities,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat<br />
					the Wanderers of other views said this<br />
					to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, Gotama the recluse<br />
					teaches his disciples doctrine<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come ye, monks,<br />
					Abandoning the five hindrances,<br />
					the corruptions of the heart,<br />
					which cause weakening of insight,<br />
					do ye cultivate the seven limbs of wisdom.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, we also thus teach doctrine<br />
					to our disciples, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come ye, friends!</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the five hindrances,<br />
					the corruptions of the heart<br />
					which cause weakening of insight,<br />
					do ye cultivate the seven limbs of wisdom.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now herein, friends,<br />
					what is the distinction,<br />
					what the peculiarity of,<br />
					what is the difference between<br />
					Gotama the recluse's teaching of doctrine<br />
					and our teaching,<br />
					between his instruction<br />
					and our instruction?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon those monks made no reply,<br />
					either of approval or of disapproval<br />
					to those wanderers holding other views;<br />
					but, without expressing either approval or disapproval,<br />
					they rose up and went away,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will learn the meaning of this saying<br />
					from the Exalted One."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So those monks, after wandering through Sāvatthī for alms,<br />
					on returning from their alms-round<br />
					and eating their meal,<br />
					went to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, here in the forenoon we robed,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					we set off for Sāvatthī to gather alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, it occurred to us thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is full early to go to Sāvatthī to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we pay a visit<br />
					to the Park of the Wanderers who hold other views.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So we went there<br />
					and on coming to them<br />

					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they we sat<br />

					<p class="f4">'Friends, Gotama the recluse<br />
					teaches his disciples doctrine<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, we also thus teach doctrine<br />
					to our disciples, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come ye, friends!</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the five hindrances,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now herein, friends,<br />
					what is the distinction,<br />
					what the peculiarity of,<br />
					what is the difference between<br />
					Gotama the recluse's teaching of doctrine<br />
					and our teaching,<br />
					between his instruction<br />

					<p class="f4">So, lord, we made no reply<br />
					to those Wanderers holding other views,<br />
					either of approval or of disapproval,<br />
					but without expressing approval or disapproval,<br />
					we rose up and came away, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will learn the meaning of this saying from the Exalted One.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When the Wanderers of other views thus speak, monks,<br />
					thus should they be answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whenever, friends, the mind is sluggish,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Again, friends, when the mind is elated,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at such time<br />
					which of the limbs of wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">To cultivate which is reasonable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, monks, the Wanderers of other views<br />
					will be unable to explain themselves,<br />
					and further<br />
					will come to an ill pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, it is beyond their scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">For I behold not, monks,<br />
					anyone in the world,<br />
					with its devas and Maras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					with its host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					with its devas and mankind,<br />
