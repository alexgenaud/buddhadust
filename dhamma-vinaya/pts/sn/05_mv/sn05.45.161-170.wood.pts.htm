					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> takes this to mean 'holy life with wrong views'; but even to long for the 'holy life' is a subtle fault, according to the Master's tsaching. The word <i>brahmacariya</i> (best practice) had degenerated, by the time of Buddhaghosa (<i>cf.</i> <i>VibhA.</i> 504) to mean only 'celibacy' or 'chastity' <i>(methuna-virati);</i> but see above, I, 4, vii. At <i>Vibh.</i> 366 it is defined as holding contrary views <i>(vipariyesa-gāho)</i> such as 'the world is eternal,' etc.! Or should we translate 'longings of (incidental to) the holy life'?</p>
