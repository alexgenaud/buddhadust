					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					which are without check and hindrance,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of<br />
					with uncorrupted heart,<br />
					conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is mindfulness,<br />
					if unrestrained by check and hindrance,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of<br />
					with uncorrupted heart,<br />
					conduce to realizing the fruits of liberation by knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom which is investigation of the Norm,<br />
