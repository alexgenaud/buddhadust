					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.52.008.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> THUS have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Sāl-tree Hut.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, take the case of the river Ganges<br />
					which flows to the east,<br />
					slides to the east,<br />
					tends to the east.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there comes a great crowd of folk<br />
					with pick and basket<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will make this river Ganges<br />
					flow,<br />
					slide<br />
					and tend to the west."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, friends?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that great crowd of folk<br />
					make the river Ganges<br />
					flow,<br />
					slide<br />
					and tend to the west?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely not, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because, as the river Ganges<br />
					flows,<br />
					slides<br />
					and tends to the east,<br />
					it were no easy thing<br />
					to make it flow<br />
					slide<br />
					tend to the west:<br />
					insomuch that fatigue and vexation<br />
					would be the lot<br />
					of that great crowd of folk.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just so, friends,<br />
					in the case of a monk<br />
					who is cultivating the four arisings of mindfulness<br />
					and making much of them,<br />
					suppose the rajah's royal ministers<br />
					or his friends<br />
					or boon-companions<br />
					or kinsmen<br />
					or blood-relations<br />
					were to come to <a id="pg267"><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span></a> that monk<br />
					and tempt him<br />
					with the offer of wealth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, good man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should these yellow robes torment you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why parade about<br />
					with shaven crown and bowl?</p>

					<p class="f4">Come!<br />
					Return to the lower life,<br />
					enjoy possessions<br />
					and do deeds of merit."</p>

					<p class="f4">But, friends, for that monk,<br />
					who is cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					the four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					to reject the training<br />
					and return to the lower life<br />
					were a thing impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, friends,<br />
					as that monk's heart has<br />
					for many a long day<br />
					been flowing,<br />
					sliding,<br />
					tending to seclusion,<br />
					for him to return to the lower life<br />
					were a thing impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friends,<br />
					does a monk cultivate,<br />
					make much of,<br />
					the four arisings of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friends,<br />
					a monk dwells in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					being ardent,<br />
					self-possessed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">contemplating feelings in feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					being ardent,<br />
					self-possessed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">contemplating mind in mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					being ardent,<br />
					self-possessed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting;</p>

					<p class="f4">contemplating mind-states in mind-states (as transient),<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					being ardent,<br />
					self-possessed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, friends, is how a monk cultivates, makes much of the four arisings of mindfulness.'</p>
