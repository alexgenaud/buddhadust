					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					robing himself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī<br />
					on his begging round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda saw <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/janussoni.htm">Jānussoni,</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the brahmin, driving out of Sāvatthī in his car,<br />
					drawn by pure white mares.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">White were the steeds harnessed thereto<br />
					and white the trappings,<br />
					white the car.</p>

					<p class="f4">White were the fittings,<br />
					white the reins,<br />
					the goad,<br />
					the canopy,<br />
					his turban,<br />
					his clothes<br />
					and sandals,<br />
					and by a white fan<br />
					was he fanned.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when folk beheld it they cried out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Aha!</p>

					<p class="f4">There's the best of cars!</p>

					<p class="f4">There's the best of cars for beauty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					after going his begging round,<br />
					came back and ate his meal<br />
					and went to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					came to him,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, robing myself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					I entered Sāvatthī on my begging round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, I saw Jānussoni, the brahmin, driving out of Sāvatthī in his car,<br />
					drawn by pure white mares.</p>

					<p class="f4">White were the steeds harnessed thereto<br />
					and white the trappings,<br />
					white the car.</p>

					<p class="f4">White were the fittings,<br />
					white the reins,<br />
					the goad,<br />
					the canopy,<br />
					his turban,<br />
					his clothes<br />
					and sandals,<br />
					and by a white fan<br />
					was he fanned.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when folk beheld it they cried out:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Aha!</p>

					<p class="f4">There's the best<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> of cars!</p>

					<p class="f4">There's the best of cars for beauty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, can one point out the best of cars in this Norm and discipline?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"One can, Ānanda,"<br />
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Best of cars,' Ānanda, is a term that may be applied to this very Ariyan eightfold way -<br />
					'best of cars,'<br />
					'Norm-car,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					'unsurpassed for its conquest in the fight.'"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Right aim, Ānanda,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					ends in the restraint of lust,<br />
					ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right speech, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Right action, Ānanda,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					ends in the restraint of lust,<br />
					ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />

					<p class="f4">Right living, Ānanda,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					ends in the restraint of lust,<br />
					ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />

					<p class="f4">Right effort, Ānanda,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					ends in the restraint of lust,<br />
					ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right mindfulness, Ānanda,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />

					<p class="f4">Right concentration, Ānanda,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					ends in the restraint of lust,<br />
					ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">By this method, Ānanda,<br />
					you are to understand the words<br />
					'best of cars,'<br />
					'Norm car,'<br />
					'unsurpassed for its conquest in the fight,'<br />
					are terms that may be applied<br />
					to this same Ariyan eightfold path."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying, the Happy One added this further as Teacher:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso hath Faith and Wisdom, - these two states<br />
							For ever yoked together lead him on:<br />
							Conscience the pole, and Mind the yoke thereof,<br />
							And Heedfulness his watchful charioteer.<br />
							The car is furnished forth with Righteousness,<br />
							Rapture its axle, Energy its wheels,<br />
							And Calm, yokefellow of the balanced mind,<br />
							Desirelessness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> the drapery thereof,<br />
							Goodwill and Harmlessness his weapons are,<br />
							Together with Detachment of the mind.<br />
							Endurance is his leathern coat of mail:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And to attain the Peace this car rolls on.<br />
							'Tis built by self, by one's own self becometh<br />
							This best of cars, unconquerable (in battle).<br />
							Seated therein the sages leave the world,<br />
							And verily they win the victory.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
