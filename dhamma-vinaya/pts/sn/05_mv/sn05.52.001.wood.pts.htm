					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the venerable Anuruddha was meditating in solitude<br />
					this train of thought occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whosoever neglect the four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					by them also is neglected<br />
					the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever undertake the four arisings of mindfulness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					reading with his mind<br />
					the train of thought<br />
					in the mind of the venerable Anuruddha, -<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br />
					even so did he appear before the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and said this to him:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward's abridgment indicates that these passages should be constructed to include 'feelings, mind, and mind-states' at this point. But the Pali and his completion of the sutta indicates that what is required is a repetition of the whole sequence once for each, 'body, feelings, mind, mind-states', which is what I have done here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> Woodward has abridged these three passages and in so doing has altered the internal order which in the Pali is identical throughout the three passages and additionally he has inserted the idea 'dwells in body' which does not appear in this sutta but which does appear in both Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas. I have followed his construction but restored the order.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn3" href="#edfn3">ed3</a>]</sup> Here and for 'mind' and 'mind-states' Woodward changes his contstruction to: "Inwardly as regards ~ he dwells ...". I have retained is first construction to parallel the consistency of the Pali.</p>
