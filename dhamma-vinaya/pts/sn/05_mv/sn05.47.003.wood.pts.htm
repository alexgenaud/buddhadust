					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					that monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine in brief,<br />
					such that, on hearing it,<br />
					I might dwell remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And thus maybe some silly fellows<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> here<br />
					may inquire of me,<br />
					and when I preach them doctrine<br />
					they may think it worth their while<br />
					to follow after me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my lord the Exalted One teach me doctrine in brief!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Happy One teach me doctrine in brief!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely I could understand the meaning<br />
					of the Exalted One's words!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely I should become an heir<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to the Exalted One's words!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, monk, you must purify the rudiments in good states.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are virtue that is truly pure,<br />
					and straight view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monk, when your virtue shall be truly pure<br />
					and your view straight,<br />
					thenceforward, monk,<br />
					leaning on virtue,<br />
					established in virtue,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					you can cultivate the four stations of mindfulness<br />
					in a threefold way.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monk, as regards your own self,<br />
					in body contemplating body (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br />
					in body contemplating body (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br />
					and as regards externals,<br />
					in body contemplating body (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, <a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> as regards your own self,<br />
					in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br />
					in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br />
					and as regards externals,<br />

					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as regards your own self,<br />
					in mind contemplating mind (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br />
					in mind contemplating mind (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br />
					and as regards externals,<br />
					in mind contemplating mind (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as regards your own self,<br />
					in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, as regards externals,<br />
					in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, both as regards your own self<br />
					and as regards externals,<br />
					in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient)<br />
					do you abide ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monk, when you,<br />
					leaning on virtue,<br />
					established in virtue,<br />
					shall have cultivated<br />
					these four stations of mindfulness<br />
					in this threefold manner,<br />
					then, monk, you may look for that growth in good states<br />
					which shall come to you,<br />
					whether by night or by day,<br />
					and not for falling away in good states."</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon that monk was delighted with the words of the Exalted One,<br />
					and was glad of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he rose up,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that monk,<br />
					dwelling solitary,<br />
					remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal<br />
					for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br />
					for the homeless,<br />
					even that unrivalled goal of right living, -<br />
					attained it even in this very life,<br />
					and knowing it for himself,<br />
					realizing it for himself,<br />
					abode therein,<br />
					so that he came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for me there is no more of being here."</p>

					<p class="f4">And that monk was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
