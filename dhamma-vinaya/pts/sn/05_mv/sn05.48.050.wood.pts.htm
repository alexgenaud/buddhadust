					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_angas">Angas,</a> at Market<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> so called,<br />
					a township of the Angas.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now on that occasion the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tell me, Sāriputta, could an Ariyan disciple who is utterly devoted to,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who has perfect faith in the Tathāgata, -<br />
					could an Ariyan disciple have any doubt or wavering<br />
					as to the Tathāgata<br />
					or the Tathāgata's teaching?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'Lord, an Ariyan disciple who is utterly devoted to the <a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> Tathāgata,<br />
					who has perfect faith in the Tathāgata,<br />
					could have no doubt,<br />
					could have no wavering<br />
					as to the Tathāgata<br />
					or the Tathāgata's teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Of the Ariyan disciple who has faith, lord, this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">He will dwell resolute in energy,<br />
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities<br />
					and to acquire good qualities:</p>

					<p class="f4">He will be stout and strong to exert himself,<br />
					not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">His energy, lord, is the controlling faculty of energy.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. Of a faithful Ariyan disciple, lord,<br />
					who is resolute in energy,<br />
					this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">He will be mindful,<br />
					possessed of supreme discrimination,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					one who calls to mind and remembers<br />
					things said long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">His mindfulness, lord, is the controlling faculty of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Of a faithful Ariyan disciple, lord,<br />
					who is resolute in energy,<br />
					with mindfulness established,<br />
					this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">He will make self-surrender the object of his thought,<br />
					he will lay hold of concentration,<br />
					one-pointedness of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">His concentration, lord, is the controlling faculty of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Again, lord, of a faithful Ariyan disciple who is established in mindfulness,<br />
					whose thought is tranquillized,<br />
					this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">He will fully understand:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A world without end<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is the round of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">No beginning can be seen of beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance,<br />
					bound by craving,<br />
					who run on,<br />
					who fare on<br />
					through the round of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The utter passionless ceasing of ignorance,<br />
					of this body of darkness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is this blissful state,<br />
					this excellent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> state,<br />
					to wit: -<br />
					the calming down of all the activities,<br />
					the giving up of all bases (for rebirth),<br />
					the destruction of craving,<br />

					cessation,<br />
					Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">His insight, lord, is the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Lord, that faithful Ariyan disciple,<br />
					thus striving and striving <a id="pg202"><span class="f2 g"><b>[202]</b></span></a> again,<br />
					thus recollecting again and again,<br />
					thus again and again composing bis mind,<br />
					thus clearly discerning again and again,<br />
					gains utter confidence,<br />
					when he considers:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to tbose things<br />
					which formerly I had only heard tell of,<br />
					now I dwell having experienced them<br />
					in my own person:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">9. Well said! Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple who is utterly devoted to the Tathāgata,<br />
