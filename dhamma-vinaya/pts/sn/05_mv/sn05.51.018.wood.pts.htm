					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is by cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					four bases of psychic power<br />
					that a monk,<br />

					by his own unaided powers<br />
					the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					which is free from the <i>āsavas,</i><br />
					and having won it<br />
					dwells therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>
