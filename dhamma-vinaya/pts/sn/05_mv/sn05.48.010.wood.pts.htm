					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br />
					the controlling power of energy,<br />
					the controlling power of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling power of concentration,<br />
					the controlling power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling power of faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has faith in the wisdom of the Tathāgata, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it is, the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					supremely Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the controlling power of faith.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling power of energy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					dwells resolute in energy,<br />
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br />
					to acquire good qualities,<br />
					strenuously exerting himself,<br />
					not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">He starts desire,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					strives,<br />
					sets going energy,<br />
					lays hold of thought<br />

					<p class="f4">He starts desire<br />

					sets going energy,<br />
					lays hold of thought<br />
					and exerts effort<br />
					for the persistence of good qualities that have arisen,<br />
					for their non-confusion,<br />

					for their increase and development,<br />
					for their perfecting.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling power of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					is mindful,<br />
					possessed of supreme discrimination,<br />
					one who calls to mind and remembers<br />
					things said and done long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in body contemplating body (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in feelings contemplating feelings (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind contemplating mind (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells in mind-states contemplating mind-states (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the controlling power of mindfulness.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling power of concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple,<br />
					making self-surrender the object of his thought,<br />
					lays hold of concentration,<br />
					lays hold of one-pointedness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, aloof from sensuality,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters on the first trance,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					which is born of solitude,<br />
					easeful and zestful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br />
					he enters on<br />
					(that inward calm,<br />
					that single-minded purpose,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful<br />
					and full of ease,<br />
					which is)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the second trance,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then (by the fading out of zest<br />
					he becomes balanced<br />
					and remains mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences with the body<br />
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br />
					The balanced thoughtful man<br />
					dwells happily; and)<br />
					he enters on the third trance<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br />
					he enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth trance,<br />
					which is free of pain<br />
					and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the controlling power of concentration.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling power of insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					is possessed of insight thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He has insight<br />
					for tracing out the rise and fall of things,<br />
					insight which is Ariyan,<br />
					penetrating,<br />
					going on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is tiie arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands, as it really is,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br />
					that goes to the cessation of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'the controlling power of insight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, are the five controlling powers."</p>
