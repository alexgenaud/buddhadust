					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Ñatika,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in Brick Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Ānanda came to see the Exalted One<br />
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg312"><span class="f2 g"><b>[312]</b></span></a> "Lord, the monk named Sāḷha bas made an end.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The monk Sāḷha, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Nandā the nun, Ānanda,<br />
					who has made an end,<br />
					by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					has taken birth spontaneously<br />
					(in the Pure Abodes),<br />
					there to pass away,<br />
					destined never to return thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sudatta, the lay-disciple, Ānanda,<br />
					who has made an end,<br />
					by destroying three fetters<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and by weakening those of lust,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and delusion,<br />
					is a once-returner:<br />
					coming back to this world just once more<br />
					he will make an end of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sujātā, the lay-woman disciple, Ānanda,<br />
					who has made an end,<br />
					by destroying three fetters,<br />
					is a stream-winner,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda,<br />
					it is no wonder<br />
					that a human being should make an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, when each one dies,<br />
					you come and ask me about the matter,<br />
					it is troublesome to the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, I wi11 teach you a Norm-teaching<br />
					called 'The Mirror of the Norm,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					possessing which<br />

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br />
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br />
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br />
					the Woeful Way and the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> And of what sort, Ānanda,<br />

					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br />

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is that Norm-teaching<br />
					called 'Mirror of the Norm,' possessed of which which<br />
					the Ariyan disciple may,<br />
					if he please,<br />
					himself proclaim of himself<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br />
					cut off is rebirth in an animal womb,<br />
					cut off is the realm of ghosts,<br />
