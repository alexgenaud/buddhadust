The Buddha states that whatever seekers and brahmins there are, past, future, or present, who declare that they have been or will be awakened to things the way they are, do so by declaring that they have done so by way of deep comprehension of the Four Truths." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					in time past<br />
					have declared that they have in very truth<br />
					gained the highest wisdom,<br />
					all of them have declared<br />
					that they have penetrated<br />
					in very truth,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br />
					in future time<br />
					will declare that they have in very truth<br />
					gained the highest wisdom,<br />
					all of them will declare<br />
					that they have penetrated<br />
					in very truth,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br />
					in the present time<br />
					do declare that they have in very truth<br />
					gained the highest wisdom,<br />
					all of them do declare<br />
					that they have penetrated<br />
					in very truth,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice<br />
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					in time past<br />
					have declared that they have in very truth<br />
					gained the highest wisdom,<br />
					all of them have declared<br />
					that they have penetrated<br />
					in very truth,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br />
					in future time<br />
					will declare that they have in very truth<br />
					gained the highest wisdom,<br />
					all of them will declare<br />
					that they have penetrated<br />
					in very truth,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br />
					in the present time<br />
					do declare that they have in very truth<br />
					gained the highest wisdom,<br />
					all of them do declare<br />
					that they have penetrated<br />
					in very truth,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
