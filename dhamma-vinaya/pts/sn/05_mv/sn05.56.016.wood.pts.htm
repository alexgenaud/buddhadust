					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, do ye bear in mind<br />
					the four Ariyan truths<br />
					taught by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, lord, do bear in mind<br />
					the Ariyan truths<br />
					taught by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monk, do you bear in mind<br />
					the four Ariyan truths<br />
					taught by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br />
					Ill is the first Ariyan truth<br />
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This 'Ill'<br />
					is not the first Ariyan truth<br />
					taught by Gotama the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejecting this Ill<br />
					as the first Ariyan truth,<br />
					I will proclaim another Ill,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br />
					the arising of Ill is the second Ariyan truth<br />
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The arising of Ill<br />
					is not the second Ariyan truth<br />

					<p class="f4">Rejecting this arising of Ill<br />

					I will proclaim another arising of Ill,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br />
					the ceasing of Ill<br />
					is the third Ariyan truth<br />
					taught by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The ceasing of Ill<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I bear in mind that<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or brahmin should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill<br />

					<p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, lord, is how I bear in mind<br />
					the Ariyan truths<br />
					taught by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">You rightly bear in mind<br />
					the four Ariyan truths<br />
					taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ill<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluse or <a id="pg364"><span class="f2 g"><b>[364]</b></span></a> brahmin should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">he could not do so.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ceasing of Ill<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, monk, do you bear in mind<br />
					the four Ariyan truths<br />
					taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill."</p>
