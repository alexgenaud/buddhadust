In the first Sāriputta questions Anuruddha about what states should be abandoned by a learner. (The Four Settings-up of memory) In the second Sāriputta questions Anuruddha about what states should be abandoned by one who is no longer seeking. (Again, the Four Settings-up of Memory) In the third Sāriputta asks Anuruddha about what practice he has undertaken to achieve great magic powers.
