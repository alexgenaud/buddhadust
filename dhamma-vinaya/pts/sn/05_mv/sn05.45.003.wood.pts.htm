					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The whole of the holy life, lord,<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy with what is lovely.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well said! Well said, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">The whole,<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy with what is lovely.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend,<br />
					an associate,<br />
					an intimate<br />
					of what is lovely<br />
					we may expect this, -<br />
					that he will develop the Ariyan eightfold way,<br />
					that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Sāriputta, does such a monk<br />
					develop and make much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Sāriputta, he cultivates right view,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">likewise right speech,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Sāriputta, is how a monk who is a friend,<br />
					an associate,<br />
					an intimate of what is lovely,<br />
					cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the method, Sāriputta,<br />
					by which you are to understand<br />
					how the whole of this holy life<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy<br />
					with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Sāriputta, beings liable to rebirth<br />
					are liberated from rebirth;<br />
					beings liable to decay,<br />
					liable to death,<br />
					liable to grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					are liberated therefrom<br />
					because of my friendship with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by this method, Sāriputta,<br />
					that you are to understand how<br />
					the whole of this holy life<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy with what is lovely.</p>
