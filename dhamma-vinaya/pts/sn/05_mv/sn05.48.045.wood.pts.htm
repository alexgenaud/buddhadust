					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in East Park,<br />
					at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, by cultivating and making much<br />
					of what controlling faculties<br />
					does the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br />
					declare gnosis,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br />
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					there is no more of being here for me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br />
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br />
					of what he has just uttered."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, by cultivating and making much<br />
					of a single controlling faculty,<br />
					a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br />
					may thus declare gnosis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br />

					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what is that one controlling faculty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in the Ariyan disciple who has won insight<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					faith is established as a matter of course,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					energy is established as a matter of course,<br />

					concentration is established as a matter of course.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating and making much<br />
