					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward omits the development into four sub-sections of this group of suttas, but the pattern was established in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.45.139-148.wood.pts.htm">§139.</a> The PTS Pali indicates after this first sutta that the pattern should be followed. The BJT has each sub-division as a separate sutta. The Bhk. Bodhi translation is organized as here (suttas with 4 sub-sections), but is abridged.</p>
