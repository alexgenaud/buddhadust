					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is possessed of systematic thought, monks, it may be expected that he will cultivate the Ariyan eightfold way, that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk who is possessed of systematic thought cultivate and make much of the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates right view, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right speech, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness, which ends in the restraint of passion, which ends in the restraint of hatred, which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration, which is based on detachment, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrendeer.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who is possessed of systematic thought cultivates and makes much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>
