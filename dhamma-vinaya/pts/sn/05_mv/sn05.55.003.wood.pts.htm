					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					in Bamboo Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg299"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span></a> Now on that occasion Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br />
					was sick<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br />
					called to his father Jotika the housefather,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you go to the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him,<br />
					with your head worship at the feet of the Exalted One,<br />
					and say in my name:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br />
					is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships with his head<br />
					at the Exalted One's feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It were a good thing, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would come to the house<br />
					of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, my lad,"<br />
					said Jotika the housefather<br />
					in reply to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br />
					and went to the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Jotika the housefather<br />
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple<br />
					is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships with his head<br />
					at the feet of the Exalted One<br />
					and says thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It were a good thing, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would come to the house<br />
					of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					set off for the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br />
					and on arriving there<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having sat down<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Dīghāvu,<br />
					I hope you are bearing up,<br />
					I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br />
					and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br />
					and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Dīghāvu,<br />
					thus must you train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will be blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it <a id="pg300"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span></a> is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will be blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will be blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also I will be blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Dīghāvu,<br />
					is how you must train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these four limbs of stream-winning, lord,<br />
					which have been taught by the Exalted One,<br />
					all of those conditions<br />
					are to be found in me,<br />
					and I do live in accordance with them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, I am indeed blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />

					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />

					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />

					a thing not involving time,<br />

					<p class="f4">I am indeed blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />

					which lead to concentration of the mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Dīghāvu,<br />
					resting on these four limbs of stream-winning,<br />
					you should further practise<br />
					the six conditions<br />
					which are constituent parts of knowledge.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Dīghāvu, do you dwell<br />
					contemplating impermanence<br />
					in all the activities,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					conscious of ill<br />
					in impermanence,<br />
					conscious of there being no self<br />
					in what is ill,<br />
					conscious of abandoning,<br />
					of dispassion,<br />
					of cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Dīghāvu,<br />
					is how you must train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, as to these same six conditions,<br />
					which are constituent parts of knowledge,<br />
					all of them are to be found in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do live<br />
					contemplating impermanence<br />
					in all the activities,<br />
					conscious of ill<br />
					in impermanence,<br />
					conscious of there being no self<br />
					in what is ill,<br />
					conscious of abandoning,<br />
					of dispassion,<br />
					of cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, I have this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would not have the housefather Jotika here<br />
					fall into dejection at my death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Don't you trouble about that, Dīghāvu, my lad!<br />
					(said his father).</p>

					<p class="f4">Look you, Dīghāvu, my lad!</p>

					<p class="f4">Attend closely to what the Exalted One is saying to you."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> So the Exalted One,<br />
					having thus admonished Dīghāvu the lay-disciple,<br />
					rose from his seat and went awray.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after the Exalted One had gone<br />
					Dīghāvu the lay-disciple made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of monks<br />
					went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, that lay-disciple named Dīghāvu,<br />
					who was admonished in brief by the Exalted One,<br />
					has made an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his lot?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his destiny in the life to come?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage, monks, was Dīghāvu the lay-disciple.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lived according to the Norm.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He did not harm me<br />
					by disputings about the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dīghāvu, the lay-disciple, monks,<br />
					by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					is reborn by spontaneous birth.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">His destiny<br />
					is not to return from that world."</p>
