					<p class="f4">At these words Saṅgārava the brahmin said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should lift up the fallen,<br />
					discover the hidden,<br />
					point out the way to the bewildered,<br />
					show a light in the gloom, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now they that have eyes to see||<br />
					can see objects,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">even so in divers ways<br />
					has the Exalted One expounded the truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord,<br />
					do go for refuge to the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama accept me as a disciple,<br />
					as one who from this day forth,<br />
					so long as life shall last,<br />
					has gone to him for refuge."</p>
