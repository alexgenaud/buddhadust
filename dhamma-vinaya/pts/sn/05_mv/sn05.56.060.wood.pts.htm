					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, that Himalaya, lord of mountains,<br />
					should waste away,<br />
					come to an end,<br />
					except for seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as mustard seeds.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg390"><span class="f2 g"><b>[390]</b></span></a> Now what tbink ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br />
					that part of Himalaya, lord of mountains,<br />
					that has wasted away,<br />
					come to an end,<br />
					or those seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as mustard seeds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, lord, this is the greater,<br />
					Himalaya, lord of mountains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exceeding small<br />
					are the seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as mustard seeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">They cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith:<br />
					they do not amount to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part<br />
					when laid beside that part of Himalaya<br />
					that has wasted away,<br />
					come to an end, -<br />
					those seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as mustard seeds."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br />
					for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br />
					for the person who has understanding,<br />
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up,<br />
					and infinitely small<br />
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of it<br />
					when set beside that Ill<br />
					which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up, -<br />
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br />
					for the man who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
