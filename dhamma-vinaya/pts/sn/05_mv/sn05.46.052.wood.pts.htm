<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga: 52. The exact similarity in the outward form of the practices of a group of ascetics with one method of instruction used by The Buddha leads to the question of what is the difference between the two sects. The Buddha reveals an interpretation of the doctrine unique to the understanding of the awakened mind, inaccesable through any other source." />

					<p class="f4">Now a number<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of monks,<br />
					robing themselves in the forenoon,<br />

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon those monks made no reply,<br />
					either of approval or of disapproval<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So those monks, after wandering through Sāvatthī for alms, on returning from their alms-round and eating their meal, went to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, here in the forenoon we robed, and taking bowl and <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> outer robe we set off for Sāvatthī to gather alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, it occurred to us thus.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when the Wanderers of other views say this, they should be answered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But there is a method, friends,<br />
					following which the five hindrances are ten in number,<br />
					and the seven limbs of wisdom fourteen."</p>

					<p class="f4">When questioned as to this, monks,<br />
					the Wanderers of other views<br />
					will be unable to explain themselves,<br />
					and further will come to an ill pass.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, it is beyond their scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">For I behold not, monks,<br />
					anyone in the world,<br />
					with its devas and its Māras, its Brahmās,<br />
					with its host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					with its devas and mankind,<br />
					who could satisfy the mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />

					save only a Tathāgata<br />

					<h4 class="ctr">I. The Five are Ten</h4>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is the method of explanation<br />

					<p class="f4">Sensual lust of the external, monks, -<br />

					<p class="f4">So when we speak of the hindrance of personal lust,<br />
					that is what is meant.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					that is what is meant.</p>

					<p class="f4">By this method it is twofold.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the method of explanation<br />

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness, monks, as to one's own personal conditions -<br />

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness, monks, as to external conditions, -<br />
