					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Bhadda<br />
					were staying at Pāṭaliputra<br />
					in Cock's Pleasaunce.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhadda,<br />
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously and,<br />
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Bhadda said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, friend Ānanda, what is the condition,<br />
					what is the cause,<br />
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br />
					the good Norm decays?</p>

					<p class="f4">What again, friend Ānanda, is the condition,<br />
					what the cause,<br />
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br />
					the good Norm does not decay?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, friend Bhadda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome is your penetration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome is your ready wit.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, friend Ānanda, what is the condition,<br />
					what is the cause,<br />
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br />
					the good Norm decays?</p>

					<p class="f4">What again, friend Ānanda, is the condition,<br />
					what the cause,<br />
					why, when the Tathāgata has finally passed away,<br />
					the good Norm does not decay?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, it is owing to not cultivating,<br />
					not making much of<br />
					four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, friend, is the reason<br />
					why the good Norm decays.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, it is owing to cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					four stations of mindfulness<br />
					that the good Norm does not decay.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, a monk abides in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is owing to not cultivating,<br />
					not making much of<br />
					these four stations of mindfulness<br />
					that is the reason<br />
					why the good Norm decays.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, it is owing to cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					these four stations of mindfulness<br />
					that the good Norm does not decay.</p>
