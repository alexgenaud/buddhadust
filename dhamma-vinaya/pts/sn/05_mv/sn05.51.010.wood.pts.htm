The Buddha tells Ānanda that one who had cultivated the four paths to magic power could live out the remainder of the kalpa. He then tells him he has cultivated the paths. But Ānanda does not take the hint and ask the Buddha to live out the remainder of the kalpa. The Buddha then renounces the remainder of his lifespan and states that he will die in three months time." />

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One,<br />
					robing himself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					set out for Vesālī<br />
					to beg for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After going his alms-rounds in Vesālī,<br />
					returning and eating his meal,<br />
					he called to the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, take a mat.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I will go to Capala Shrine<br />

					<p class="f4">"Very well, lord,"<br />

					and taking a mat<br />
					he followed in the footsteps of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the Exalted One reached Capala Shrine<br />
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					saluting the Exalted One,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Delightful, Ānanda, is Vesālī!</p>

					<p class="f4">Delightful are the shrines of Udena<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

							<p>This section is displayed in smaller type and indented to emphasize that it is an editorial comment of the narrator. Since Ānanda was supposedly the original narrator and would not have used the third person to reference himself, and, in any case, denied that he was at fault in this case, this is further the work of a later editor in support of the supposed censure of Ānanda at the first council. It is forcing an interpretation on the reader.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg234"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></a> At these words the Exalted One thus spake<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One had rejected his life's aggregate<br />

					<p class="f4">And seeing the significance thereof<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
