					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu,<br />
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan<br />
					came to see Godha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Sakyan,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I know, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p>[So Godha and I<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg323"><span class="f2 g"><b>[323]</b></span></a> Now suppose, lord, some question of doctrine arises,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Again suppose, lord, some question of doctrine arises,<br />

					<p class="f4">(Then, said the Exalted One, turning to Godha):</p>
