					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near Kapilavatthu,<br />
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan came to see Godha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Sakyan,<br />
					and on coming to him said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Godha, so far as you know,<br />
					blessed with how many things<br />
					is a stream-winner (declared)<br />
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I know, Mahānāma,<br />
					that he is blessed with three things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />

					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />

					<p class="f4">Blessed with these three things, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">But as far as you know, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">"For my part, Godha, I know<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that he is blessed with four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Mahānāma, the Ariyan disciple has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">He has unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he is blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />

					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four things, Godha,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Wait a bit, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wait a bit, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">So Mahānāma and Godha the Sakyans<br />

					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side then

					<p class="f4">Let us go to see the Exalted One<br />

					<p>[So Godha and I<br />
					came to see the Exalted One.]</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg323"><span class="f2 g"><b>[323]</b></span></a> Now suppose, lord, some question of doctrine arises,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					and on the other side is the Order of monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One accept this<br />
					(as proof of) my loyalty to him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again suppose, lord, some question of doctrine arises,<br />

					<p class="f4">So again, lord, if on the one side were the Exalted one,<br />
					on the other side the Order,<br />
					both of monks and nuns,<br />

					I myself should side with the Exalted One</p>

					<p class="f4">or if again on the other side were the Order,<br />

					<p class="f4">if added to these were the whole world,<br />

					<p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One accept this<br />

					<p class="f4">(Then, said the Exalted One, turning to Godha):</p>

					who holds such a view?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, of Mahānāma,<br />
