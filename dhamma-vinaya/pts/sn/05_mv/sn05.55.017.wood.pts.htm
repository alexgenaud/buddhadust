					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, those with whom you have sympathy,<br />
					those who think you should be listened to,<br />
					whether friends<br />

					four limbs of stream-winning.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br />
					grounded in,<br />
					established in<br />
					unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They should be advised about,<br />

					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />

					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
