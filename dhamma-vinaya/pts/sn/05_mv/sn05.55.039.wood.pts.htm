					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a> in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, robing bimself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					started off to the house of Kāḷigodhā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Sakyan lady,<br />
					and on arriving<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kāḷigodhā, the Sakyan lady,<br />
					came to the Exalted One<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she thus sat<br />
					the Exalted One said this to her:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br />
					who is blessed with four things<br />
					is a Streamwinner,<br />
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					one assured,<br />
					one bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br />
					has unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br />
					has unwavering loyalty to the the Norm, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Godhā, the Ariyan woman disciple<br />
					has unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted one's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, —<br />
					a field of merit unsrupassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">She dwells at home<br />
					with heart free from the taint of stinginess.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is open-handed,<br />
					pure-handed,<br />
					delighting in self-surrender,<br />
					one to ask a favour of,<br />
					one who delights<br />
					in dispensing charitable gifts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blessed with these four things, Godhā,<br />
					the Ariyan woman disciple<br />
					is a Stream-winner."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, as to these four limbs of stream-winning<br />
					declared by the Exalted One,<br />
					all of them are to be seen in me,<br />
					and I do live according to those things.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do have unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>

					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I do have unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br />
