<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya V: Maha Vagga; Chapter 46: Bojjhanga Samyutta, Sutta 39. The Buddha likens the diversions to the seeds that produce great trees that dominate and destroy any small tree that is nearby. Then he points out that when the seven dimensions of awakening grow and reach fulfillment these diversions are eliminated and the practice culminates in arahantship." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are mighty trees, monks,<br />
					grown from tiny seeds,<br />
					of mighty bulk,<br />
					which overspread<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> (other) trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">The trees thus overspread<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					break down,<br />
					fall to the ground<br />

					<p class="f4">What mighty trees, monks,<br />
					grown from tiny seeds,<br />
					of mighty bulk,<br />
					which overspread other trees<br />
					by which being overspread,<br />
					break up,<br />
					break down,<br />
					fall to the ground<br />
					and so lie?</p>

					<p class="f4">Trees such as the bo-tree,<br />
					the banyan,<br />
					the wave-leafed fig,<br />
					the bunched fig,<br />
					the cedar,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">These are the mighty trees, monks,<br />

					by which being overspread,<br />
					break up,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br />
					here maybe is such and such a clansman, who,<br />
					whatsoever lusts he abandons<br />
					and goes forth from home to the homeless,<br />
					just by such lusts,<br />
					or by lusts still worse than these,<br />
					is broken up,<br />
					broken down:<br />
					down he falls<br />
					and so lies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these five checks,<br />
					hindrances<br />
					which overspread the heart,<br />
					which weaken insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual desire, monks, is a check,<br />
					a hindrance<br />
					which overspreads the heart<br />
					and weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Malevolence, monks, is a check,<br />
					a hindrance<br />
					which overspreads the heart<br />
					and weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sloth and torpor, monks, is a check,<br />
					a hindrance<br />
					which overspreads the heart<br />
					and weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excitement and flurry, monks, is a check,<br />
					a hindrance<br />
					which overspreads the heart<br />
					and weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doubt and wavering, monks, is a check,<br />
					a hindrance<br />
					which overspreads the heart<br />
					and weakens insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Each of these, monks, is a check,<br />
					a hindrance<br />
					which overspreads the heart<br />
