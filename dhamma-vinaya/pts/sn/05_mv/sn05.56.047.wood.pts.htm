					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should throw into the mighty ocean<br />
					a yoke with a single hole,<br />
					and there were a blind turtle<br />
					to pop up to the surface<br />
					once in every hundred years.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that blind turtle push his neck<br />
					through that yoke with one hole<br />
					whenever he popped up to the surface,<br />
					once at the end of every hundred years?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It might be so, lord,<br />
					now and again,<br />
					after the lapse of a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, sooner I declare<br />
					would that blind turtle push his neck<br />
					through that yoke with one hole,<br />
					popping up to the surface<br />
					once in a hundred years,<br />
					than would a fool<br />
					who has gone to the Downfall<br />
					become a man again.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, here prevails<br />
					no practice of the holy life,<br />
					no righteous living,<br />
					no doing of good deeds,<br />
					no working of merit,<br />
					but just cannibalism<br />
					and preying on weaker creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through not seeing<br />
					the four Ariyan truths,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					<a id="pg384"><span class="f2 g"><b>[384]</b></span></a> the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>

							<p>"Thrown down" Whoh! There is nothing in the Suttas anything like this. Beings are reborn according to their <i>kamma.</i> The life of many devas spans <i>kalpas</i> and not all devas are streamwinners. The point of this sutta is that the difficulty of emerging from the lower births is that there is no doing of good deeds there, that is, <i>kamma.</i> Further, beings may be cast into hell with good <i>kamma</i> remaining, at the expiration of their time served they are reborn in accordance with that <i>kamma.</i></p>
