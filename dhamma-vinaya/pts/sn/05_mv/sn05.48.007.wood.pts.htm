					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br />
					the controlling power of energy,<br />
					the controlling power of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling power of concentration,<br />
					the controlling power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five controlling powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					understand not the controlling power of faith,<br />
					understand not the arising of the controlling power of faith,<br />
					understand not the perishing of the controlling power of faith,<br />

					<p class="f4">such are not worthy to be accounted recluses among recluses,<br />

					or of brahminhood,<br />

					<p class="f4">But, monks, those recluses or brahmins who have understood the controlling power of faith,<br />

					<p class="f4">such are worthy to be accounted among recluses as recluses,<br />
