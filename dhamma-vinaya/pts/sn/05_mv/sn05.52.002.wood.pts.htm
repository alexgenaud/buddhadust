					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the venerable Anuruddha was meditating in solitude<br />
					this train of thought occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whosoever neglect the four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					by them also is neglected<br />
					the Ariyan way that goes on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever undertake the four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					by them also is undertaken<br />

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					reading with his mind<br />
					the train of thought<br />
					in the mind of the venerable Anuruddha, -<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br />
					even so did he appear before the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and said this to him:</p>
