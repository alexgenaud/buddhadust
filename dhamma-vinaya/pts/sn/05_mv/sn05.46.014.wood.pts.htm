					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Kassapa the Great,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One as he sat<br />
					said to the venerable Kassapa the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Kassapa, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br />

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br />

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is energy, fully expounded by myself,<br />

					<p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, Kassapa,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Verily, lord, they are limbs of wisdom!</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, O Happy One, they are limbs of wisdom!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and the venerable Kassapa the Great was delighted thereat,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Kassapa the Great<br />
