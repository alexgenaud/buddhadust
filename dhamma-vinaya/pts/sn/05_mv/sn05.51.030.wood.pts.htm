					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks came to see the Exalted One<br />
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they sat at one side<br />
					those the Exalted One said this to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, monks, is psychic power?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the basis of psychic power?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the practice<br />
					that leads to the cultivation of psychic power?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br />
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br />
					of what he has just uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, monks, a monk enjoys<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					manifold forms of psychic power such as:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if it were through air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water.</p>

					<p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it,<br />
					as if on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br />
					like a bird upon the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br />
					though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br />
					he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br />
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'psychic power.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what,	monks, is the basis of psychic power?</p>

					<p class="f4">That path, that practice which conduces to the laying hold of,<br />
					to the winning of<br />
					psychic power, -<br />
					that, monks, is called<br />
					'the basis of psychic power.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein monks a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					desire,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					energy,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					thought,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					investigation,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'the cultivation of the bases of psychic power.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the practice<br />
					that leads to the cultivation of psychic power?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view<br />
					right aim,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right living,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called:
					'the practice<br />
					that leads to the cultivation<br />
					of the bases of psychic power'."</p>
