					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in Bamboo Grove<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br />
					was staying on the hill Vulture's Peak,<br />
					and was sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One as he sat<br />
					said to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Moggallāna, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br />
					and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br />
					and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">Moggallāna, these seven limbs of wisdom<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom, Moggallāna, that is mindfulness,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is energy,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					when cultivated<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven limbs of wisdom, Moggallāna,<br />
					fully expounded by myself,<br />
					if cultivated,<br />
					and made much of,<br />
					conduce to full comprehension,<br />
					to wisdom,<br />
					to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, lord, they are limbs of wisdom!</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, O Happy One, they are limbs of wisdom!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and the venerable Moggallāna the Great was delighted thereat,<br />
					and took pleasure in what was said by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br />
					rose up from that sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There and then that sickness of the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br />
					was abandoned.</p>
