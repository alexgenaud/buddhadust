					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					robing bimself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					went to visit a certain settlement of nuns,<br />
					and on reaching them<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of nuns came to see the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on reaching him,<br />
					saluted the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					those nuns said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are here dwelling, lord Ānanda,<br /> a number of nuns<br />
					with their minds well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					and they have attained<br />
					to greater excellence of comprehension than before.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, sisters.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, sisters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever,<br />
					be it monk or nun,<br />
					dwells with mind well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					such may be expected to attain<br />
					to greater excellence of comprehension than before."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					after instructing those nuns<br />
					with a talk about doctrine,<br />
					having roused,<br />
					incited<br />
					and gladdened them,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					rose up and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					after going his begging round in Sāvatthī<br />
					and having returned and eaten his meal,<br />
					went to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, here (in Sāvatthī) robing myself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					I went to visit a certain settlement of nuns,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then a number of nuns came to see me,<br />

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />

					<p class="f4">'There are here dwelling, lord Ānanda,<br />
					a number <a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> of nuns<br />
					with their minds well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					and they have attained<br />
					to greater excellence of comprehension than before.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord, I said to those nuns:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So it is, sisters.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, sisters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever,<br />
					be it monk or nun,<br />

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever,<br />
					be it monk or nun,<br />
					dwells with mind well established<br />
					in the four stations of mindfulness<br />
					shall so attain<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to greater excellence of comprehension than before.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what four stations?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk dwells in body contemplating body (as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus abides in body contemplating body,<br />
					either some bodily object arises,<br />
					or bodily discomfort<br />
					or drowsiness of mind<br />
					scatters his thoughts abroad to externals.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Ānanda,<br />
					his attention should be directed<br />
					to some pleasurable object of thought.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus directs it<br />
					to some pleasurable object of thought,<br />
					delight springs up in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, thus delighted,<br />
					arises zest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Full of zest<br />
					his body is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">With body so calmed<br />
					he experiences ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of one at ease<br />
					is concentrated.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">The aim on which I set my mind<br />
					I have attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come,<br />
					let me withdraw my mind<br />
					(from the pleasurable object of thought).</p>

					<p class="f4">So he withdraws his mind therefrom,<br />
					and neither starts<br />
					nor carries on<br />
					thought-process.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is fully conscious:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am without thought<br />
					initial or sustained.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am inwardly mindful.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda,<br />
