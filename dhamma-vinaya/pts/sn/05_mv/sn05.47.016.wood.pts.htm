					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Uttiya came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Uttiya said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One wrould teach me<br />
					a teaching in brief,<br />
					hearing which teaching from the Exalted One<br />
					I might dwell solitary,<br />
					remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In such case, Uttiya,<br />
					you must purify the rudiments in good states.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the rudiments in good states?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is virtue<br />
					that is truly pure<br />
					and straight view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Uttiya, when your virtue shall be truly pure<br />
					and your view straight,<br />
					thenceforward,<br />
					leaning on virtue,<br />
					established in virtue,<br />
					you can cultivate the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein Uttiya, do you abide in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					that arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide in feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide in mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abide in mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraining the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Uttiya, when you,<br />
					leaning on virtue,<br />
					established in virtue,<br />
					shall have thus cultivated<br />
					the four stations of mindfulness,<br />
					thenceforward, Uttiya,<br />
					you shall pass beyond the realm of death<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Uttiya was delighted with the words of the Exalted One<br />
					and was glad of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he rose up,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Uttiya,<br />
					dwelling solitary and remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal<br />
					for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br />
					for the homeless,<br />
					even that unrivalled goal of righteous living,<br />
					attained in even this very life:<br />
					and, knowing it for himself,<br />
					realizing it for himself,<br />
					abode therein,<br />
					so that he came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived is the righteous life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Done is what I had to do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed there is no more of being here for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Uttiya was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
