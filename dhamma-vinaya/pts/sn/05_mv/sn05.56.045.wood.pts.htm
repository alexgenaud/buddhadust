					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in Great Grove,<br />
					at the Hall of the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					robing himself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					went into Vesālī to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br />
					saw a number of Licchavi youths in the gymnasium,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					making practice at archery,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					shooting even at a distance<br />
					through a very small keyhole,<br />
					and splitting an arrow,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					shot after shot,<br />
					without ever a miss.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the venerable Ānanda saw it he exclaimed to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Practised shots are these Licchavi youths!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well practised shots indeed are these Licchavi youths,<br />
					to be able to shoot like this even at a distance!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So when the venerable Ānanda<br />
					had gone his rounds in Vesālī,<br />
					had returned and eaten his meal,<br />
					he went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, robing myself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					I set out for Vesālī on my begging rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, I saw a number of Licchavi youths<br />
					in the gymnasium<br />
					making practice at archery,<br />
					shooting even from a distance<br />
					through a very small keyhole,<br />
					and splitting an arrow,<br />
					shot after shot,<br />
					with never a miss.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I said to myself, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Practised shots are these Licchavi youths!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well practised shots indeed<br />
					are these Licchavi youths,<br />
					to be able even at a distance<br />
					to splinter an arrow<br />
					through a very small keyhole,<br />
					shot after shot,<br />
					with never a miss!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the harder,<br />
					which is the harder task to compass:</p>

					<p class="f4">To shoot like that<br />
					or <a id="pg382"><span class="f2 g"><b>[382]</b></span></a> to pierce one strand of a hair,<br />
					a hundred times divided,<br />
					with another strand?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, of course<br />
					to split a hair,<br />
					a hundred times divided,<br />
					with another strand is the harder,<br />
					much the harder task."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, Ānanda,<br />
					they who penetrate the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill',<br />
					'This is the arising of Ill',<br />
					'This is the ceasing of Ill',<br />
					'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill',<br />
					pierce through something much harder to pierce.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>
