<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 5 Maha Vagga, Samyutta 54, Sutta 13. Ānanda poses a riddle: Is there one state which completes four; four that complete seven; and seven that complete two. The answer is that minding respiration completes the four arisings of mind, the four arisings of mind completes the seven dimensions of self-awakening; the seven dimensions of self-awakening completes knowledge and vision." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is there any one state<br />
					which, if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					brings four states to completion?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do four states,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete seven states?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do seven states,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete two states?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is one state<br />
					which does complete <a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> four.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four states complete seven,<br />
					and seven complete two.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they?.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, Ānanda,<br />
					is the one state<br />
					which, if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					brings the four arisings of mindfulness to completion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					bring the seven limbs of wisdom to completion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete knowledge and release.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr">I</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated,<br />
					how made much of,<br />
					does intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					complete the four arisings of mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this method, Ānanda,<br />
					a monk who has gone to the forest<br />
					or the foot of a tree<br />
					or a lonely place,<br />
					sits down cross-legged,<br />
					holding the body straight.<br />
					Setting mindfulness in front of him,<br />
					he breathes in mindfully<br />
					and mindfully breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a long breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a long breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he draws in a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A short breath I draw in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he breathes out a short breath he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I breathe out a short breath.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in,<br />
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br />

					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes up his mind (repeating):</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, at such time as a monk,<br />
					while drawing in a long breath,<br />
					knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I draw in';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, breathing out a long breath,<br />

					<p class="f4">'A long breath I breathe out';</p>

					<p class="f4">or, when drawing in a short breath,<br />

					<p class="f4">at such time, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare, Ānanda,<br />
