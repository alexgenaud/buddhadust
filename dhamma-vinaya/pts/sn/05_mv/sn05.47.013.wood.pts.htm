					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Sāriputta was staying <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> among the Magadhese<br />
					at Nālagāmaka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					being sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Cunda the novice was in attendance<br />
					on the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it was owing to this sickness<br />
					that the venerable Sāriputta passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Cunda the novice,<br />
					taking the venerable Sāriputta's bowl and outer robe,<br />
					went to Sāvatthī,<br />
					to Jeta Grove,<br />
					and so to Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br />
					where he went to visit the venerable Ānanda,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					Cunda the novice said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are his bowl and outer robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">[This water-strainer holds his relics.]"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Cunda, this piece of news<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					will be an excuse for seeing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, friend Cunda,<br />
					to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and when we get there<br />
					we will tell him about this matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, sir," said Cunda the novice<br />
					in reply to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and Cunda the novice<br />
					went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this Cunda the novice said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are his bowl and outer robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">This water-strainer holds his relics.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, lord, thereat<br />
					my body was as if drugged.</p>

					<p class="f4">My bearings were confused.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> The teachings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> were not clear to me<br />
					when I heard the words<br />
					'the venerable Sāriputta has passed away.'"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But tell me, Ānanda,<br />
					when the venerable Sāriputta passed away,<br />
					did he take with him<br />
					the constituents of virtue;<br />
					did he take with him<br />
					the constituents of concentration;<br />
					did he take with him<br />
					the constituents of wisdom;<br />
					did he take with him<br />
					the constituents of release;<br />
					did he take with him<br />
					the constituents of release by knowing and seeing?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, lord, when the venerable Sāriputta passed away<br />
					he did not take with him the constituents of virtue;<br />
					he did not take with him<br />
					the constituents of concentration;<br />
					he did not take with him<br />
					the constituents of wisdom;<br />
					he did not take with him<br />
					the constituents of release;<br />
					he did not take with him<br />
					the constituents of release by knowing and seeing."</p>

					<p class="f4">But he was to me an adviser,<br />
					one who was well grounded.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He was an instructor,<br />
					one who could arouse,<br />
					incite<br />
					and gladden.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was unwearied in teaching the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was the patron<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of those who lived the righteous life along with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">We bear in mind<br />
					that essence of the Norm,<br />
					that patronage of the Norm<br />
					possessed by the venerable Sāriputta, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have I not aforetime<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					declared to you this, Ānanda, - <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> how in all things that are dear and delightful<br />
					there is the nature of diversity,<br />
					the nature of separation,<br />
					the nature of otherness?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it possible, Ānanda,<br />
					in the case of what is born,<br />
					what is become,<br />
					what is compounded,<br />
					what is transitory, -<br />
					how is it possible<br />
					to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, from some mighty tree,<br />
					standing firm and full of vigour<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					one of the greater limbs rots off, -<br />
					even so, Ānanda, from the mighty Order of monks,<br />
					standing firm and full of vigour,<br />
					Sāriputta has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it possible, Ānanda,<br />
					I say,<br />
					in the case of what is born,<br />
					what is become,<br />
					what is compounded,<br />
					what is transitory, -<br />
					how is it possible<br />
					that one's wish can be fulfilled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br />
					do ye abide grounded on self,<br />
					self-refuged,<br />
					taking refuge in none other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye abide grounded on the Norm,<br />
					taking refuge in the Norm,<br />
					having none other refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda,<br />
					does a monk so abide?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda,<br />
					a monk abides in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk abides grounded on self,<br />
					self-refuged,<br />
					taking refuge in none other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, Ānanda,<br />
					either now<br />
					or when I have passed away,<br />
					shall abide grounded on self,<br />
					self-refuged,<br />
					taking refuge in none other;<br />
					grounded on the Norm,<br />
					with the Norm for refuge,<br />
					taking refuge in none other, -<br />
					they, Ānanda,<br />
					shall be my monks,<br />
					they shall be atop of the gloom;<br />
					that is,<br />
					they who are anxious to learn."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>
