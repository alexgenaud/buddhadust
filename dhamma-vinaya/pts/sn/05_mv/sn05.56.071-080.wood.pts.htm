					<h1>Scents and Unguents</h1>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p80.1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.071-080.pali.bd.htm#p80.1">80.1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					taking up a little dust<br />
					on the tip of his finger-nail,<br />
					said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater,<br />
					this little dust I have taken up<br />
					on the tip of my finger-nail,<br />
					or this mighty earth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Greater, lord, is this mighty earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exceeding small<br />
					is this little dust taken up<br />
					on the tip of the Exalted One's fingernail:<br />
					it cannot be reckoned,<br />
					it cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of it<br />
					when set beside the mighty earth, -<br />
					this little dust taken up<br />
					on the tip of the Exalted One's finger-nail."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, monks,<br />
					few are those beings<br />
					that abstain from the use of flowers,<br />
					scents,<br />
					unguents<br />
					as adornments and finery:<br />
					more numerous are these beings who do not so abstain.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through not seeing four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
