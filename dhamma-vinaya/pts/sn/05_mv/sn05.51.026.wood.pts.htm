					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four bases of psychic power.</p>

					<p class="f4">WTiat four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating<br />

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this very life, previously,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					he do not establish realization,<br />
					nor do so at the time of death,<br />
					then, through having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />

					<p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br />

					nor yet at the time of death,<br />
