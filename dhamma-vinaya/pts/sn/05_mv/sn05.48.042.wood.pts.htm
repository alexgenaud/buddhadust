<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 48: Indriya Samyuttam: Sutta 42. The Buddha instructs Uddabha the Brahmin that mind is the home of the five senses, and seated in mind is the bringing to life of the five senses scope and pasturage; memory is the home of mind, and seated in memory is the bringing to life of the mind's scope and pasturage; recollectedness is the home of the memory, and seated in recollectedness is the bringing to life of the memory's scope and pasturage; freedom is the home of recollectedness, and seated in freedom is the bringing to life of recollectedness' scope and pasturage; Nibbāna is the home of freedom, and seated in Nibbāna is the bringing to life of freedom's scope and pasturage; and that to ask about the home of Nibbāna is beyond the possibility of answering, and the scope and pasturage of Nibbāna is beyond encompassing." />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.48.042.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/05_mv/sn05.48.042.olds.bd.htm">olds</a>]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in East Park,<br />
					at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin Uṇṇābha came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and, after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					Uṇṇābha the brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five sense-faculties, master Gotama,<br />
					of different scope,<br />
					of different range.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not mutually <a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> enjoy<br />
					each other's scope and range.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br />
					that of ear,<br />
					that of nose,<br />
					that of tongue,<br />
					and the sense-faculty of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama, as these five sense-faculties<br />
					are of different scope,<br />
					of different range,<br />
					and do not mutually enjoy each other's scope and range,<br />
					pray, what common ground of resort<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> have they,<br />
					and who profits by their scope and range?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, brahmin, as you say,<br />
					these five sense-faculties<br />
					of different scope<br />
					and different range,<br />
					and they do not mutually<br />
					enjoy each other's scope and range.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br />
					that of ear,<br />
					that of nose,<br />
					that of tongue,<br />
					and the sense-faculty of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, mind is their common ground of resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is mind that profits by their scope and range."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, master Gotama, what is the resort of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindfulness, brahmin, is the resort of mmd."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, master Gotama, what is the resort of mindfulness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Release, brahmin, is the resort of mindfulness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, then, master Gotama, is the resort of release?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nibbāna, brahmm, is the resort of release."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, master Gotama, what is the resort of Nibbāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The question goes too far,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">That question is beyond the compass of an answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The aim of living the holy life, brahmin,<br />
					is to plunge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> into Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has Nibbāna for its goal,<br />
					Nibbāna for its ending."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Unriabha was delighted with the words of the Exalted One and received them gladly.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he rose up from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the brahmin Uṇṇābha<br />
					the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg194"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span></a> "Suppose, monks, in a house with a peaked roof<br />
					or in a pavilion with a peaked roof,<br />
					with a window facing east,<br />
					when the sun is rising<br />
					and its rays strike through the window,<br />
					on what do they rest?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"On the western wall, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, monks,<br />
					the faith of the brahmin Uṇṇābha is bent on,<br />
					rooted in,<br />
					rests on the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is strong,<br />
					not to be uprooted<br />
					by any recluse<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or deva<br />
					or Mara<br />
					or Brahma,<br />
					or by anyone else in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if at this time<br />
					the brahmin Uṇṇābha were to make an end,<br />
					there is no fetter, bound by which,<br />
					the brahmin Uṇṇābha would come back to this world."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
