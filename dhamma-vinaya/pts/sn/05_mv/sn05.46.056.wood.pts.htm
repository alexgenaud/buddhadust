<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 46: Bojjhanga Samyutta, Sutta 56. Prince Abhaya of the Lacchavi visits the Buddha on Vulture-head Mountain. There he asks what the Buddha has to say in regard to Purana Kassapa's doctrine that there is no driving force that results in not knowing and seeing things as they are nor in seeing things as they are. The Buddha replies that wanting, deviance, lazy ways and inertia, fear and anxiety, and uncertainty and vacillation (the diversions) result in not knowing and seeing things as they are, that the seven dimensions of awakening result in seeing things as they are." />
