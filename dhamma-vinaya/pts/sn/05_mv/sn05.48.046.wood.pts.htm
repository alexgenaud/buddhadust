					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in East Park,<br />
					at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, by cultivating and making much<br />
					of what controlling faculties<br />
					does the monk in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br />
					declare gnosis,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br />
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					there is no more of being here for me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br />
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br />
					of what he has just uttered."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, by cultivating and making much<br />
					of two controlling faculties,<br />
					a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br />
					may thus declare gnosis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br />
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are those two controlling faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">By Ariyan insight and Ariyan release.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which in him is the Ariyan insight<br />
					is the controlling faculty of insight,<br />
					and that which in him<br />
					is the Ariyan release<br />
					is the controlling faculty of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by cultivating and making much of these two controlling faculties,<br />
					a man in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed<br />
					may thus declare gnosis:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know full well<br />
					that destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					there is no more of being here for me.'"</p>
