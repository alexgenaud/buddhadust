					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever monk understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">suppose from the east<br />
					there comes a recluse or brahmin<br />
					looking for dogma,<br />
					searching for dogma,<br />
					in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br />
					it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br />
					to shake that monk in his belief,<br />
					standing as he does on truth:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

					<p class="f4">suppose from the west<br />
					there comes a recluse or brahmin<br />
					looking for dogma,<br />
					searching for dogma,<br />
					in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br />
					it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br />
					to shake that monk in his belief,<br />
					standing as he does on truth:<br />
					it would be impossible to make him quake or waver;</p>

					<p class="f4">suppose from the north<br />
					there comes a recluse or brahmin<br />
					looking for dogma,<br />
					searching for dogma,<br />
					in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br />
					it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br />
					to shake that monk in his belief,<br />

					<p class="f4">suppose from the south<br />
					there comes a recluse or brahmin<br />
					looking for dogma,<br />
					searching for dogma,<br />
					in hopes of refuting such dogma,<br />
					it would be impossible for such recluse or brahmin<br />
					to shake that monk in his belief,<br />
					standing as he does on truth:<br />
					it would be impossible to make him quake or waver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, a stone column<br />
					sixteen cubits long,<br />
					and eight cubits of it<br />
					are sunk in the ground<br />
					below the pedestal,<br />
					while eight cubits<br />
					are above the pedestal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then from the east<br />
					there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br />
					it could not shake it,<br />
					could not make it quake or waver;</p>

					<p class="f4">or from the west<br />
					there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br />
					it could not shake it,<br />
					could not make it quake or waver;</p>

					<p class="f4">or from the north<br />
					there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br />
					it could not shake it,<br />
					could not make it quake or waver;</p>

					<p class="f4">or from the south<br />
					there comes a blast of wind and rain, -<br />
					it could not shake it,<br />
					could not make it quake or waver.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because monks, the pedestal is deep set,<br />
					the stone column,<br />
					is deep dug.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br />
					whatsoever monk understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill;'</p>

					<p class="f4">understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					it would be impossible to make him quake or waver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he clearly sees four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
