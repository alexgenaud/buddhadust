					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">I behold not, monks, any other single condition which,<br />
					thus cultivated and made much of,<br />
					is so conducive to abandonment<br />
					of the conditions that bind<br />
					as the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is equinimity."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how cultivated, monks,<br />
					how made much of<br />
					do the seven limbs of wisdom<br />
					conduce to the abandonment<br />
					of conditions that bind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, are the conditions that bind?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br />
					that bind and cleave to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br />

					<p class="f4">The mind, monks, is a condition that binds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein spring up attachments<br />
