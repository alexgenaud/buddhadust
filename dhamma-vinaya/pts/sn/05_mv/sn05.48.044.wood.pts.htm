<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 48: Indriya Samyuttam: Sutta 44. In a lesson clearly directed at teaching the bhikkhus the distinction between faith and knowledge, the Buddha questions Sāriputta as to whether or not he believes that the five forces lead to Nibbāna. Sāriputta states that he does not go by faith in this matter but by has realized it for himself." />
