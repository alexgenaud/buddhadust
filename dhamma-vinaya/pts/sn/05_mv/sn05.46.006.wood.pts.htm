					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Sāketa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in Anjana Grove,<br />
					in Antelope Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion Kuṇḍaliya the wanderer<br />
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					he greeted him courteously and,<br />
					after the exchange of the compliments<br />
					of friendship and courtesy,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					Kuṇḍaliya the wanderer<br />
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, I live near the Park<br />
					and am a frequenter of companies.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well, Master Gotama, this is my practice<br />
					when I have had my morning meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">I roam and wander from park to park,<br />
					from garden to garden.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I behold certain recluses and brahmins<br />
					debating on the profit<br />
					of freedom from controversy<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the profit of wrangling.</p>

					<p class="f4">But what profit is there<br />
					in the worthy Gotama's way of living?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"A Tathāgata, Kuṇḍaliya,<br />
					lives enjoying the profits<br />
					of the fruit<br />
					of release by knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama,<br />
					what are the conditions which,<br />
					when cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete the release by knowledge?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are seven limbs of wisdom, Kuṇḍaliya,<br />
					which, when cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete the release by knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What conditions, Master Gotama,<br />
					are these which,<br />
					cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete the seven limbs of wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Four stations of mindfulness, Kuṇḍaliya,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					complete the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
