In this sutta the Buddha Describes the Great Burning Hell and a bhikkhu asks him if there is any worse burning. The Buddha tells him that the burning of old age and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair that results from own-making the own-made is a worse burning than that." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward has abridged the entire second half of this sutta by reference to the previous sutta without indicating how he would manage the change. I have used the PED definition for <i>pariḍahati.</i> Here <i>Pariḷāha</i> would probabl have better been translated using some term indicating 'burning' to more closely fit the parallel, as Bhk. Bodhi's "conflagration.".</p>
