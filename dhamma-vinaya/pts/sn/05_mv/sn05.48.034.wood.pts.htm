					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of ease,<br />
					the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br />
					the controlling faculty of happiness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins understand not,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the arising<br />
					and the perishing of,<br />
					the satisfaction in,<br />
					the misery of,<br />

					these five controlling faculties,<br />

					or even in this life realized,<br />
					the goal of recluseship<br />
