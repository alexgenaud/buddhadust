					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					in time past<br />
					have gained the highest wisdom in its reality,<br />
					all of them have done so<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> by penetrating,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses<br />
					in future time<br />
					will gain the highest wisdom in its reality,<br />
					all of them will do so by penetrating,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins<br />
					in the present time<br />
					do gain the highest wisdom in its reality,<br />
					all of them do so by penetrating,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice<br />
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever recluses or brahmins<br />
					in time past<br />
					have gained the highest wisdom in its reality,<br />
					all of them have done so by penetrating,<br />
					as they really are,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>
