					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should cut up all the grass,<br />
					sticks,<br />
					branches<br />
					and stalks in this Jambudīpa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and gather them together in a heap;<br />
					and thus heaped together,<br />
					were to make stakes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having made stakes of them,<br />
					suppose he spitted all the mighty creatures<br />
					in the mighty ocean<br />
					on the mighty stakes;<br />
					likewise all the creatures of middle size<br />
					on the stakes of middle size;<br />
					likewise all the creatures of minute size<br />
					on the stakes of minute size.</p>

					<p class="f4">All the bulky creatures<br />
					in the mighty ocean might thus be used up:<br />
					but, though he should use up<br />
					and consume<br />
					all the grass,<br />
					sticks,<br />
					branches<br />
					and stalks in this Jambudīpa,<br />
					yet would there stIll remain in the mighty ocean<br />
					a majority of the minute animals<br />
					which could not be impaled on stakes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the minuteness of their bodies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even thus widespread<br />
					is the ruin of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet from such widespread ruin<br />
					he is saved<br />
					who has the gift of sight to see,<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					this is Ill,<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					this is the arising of ill,<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					this is the ceasing of ill,<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward has clearly mis-translated this and I have altered it to make sense. His original is as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should cut up all the grass,<br />
					sticks,<br />
					branches<br />
					and stalks in this Jambudīpa<br />
					and gather them together in a heap;<br />
					were to bind them together<br />
					and make a stake thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having made a stake of them,<br />
					suppose he spitted all the mighty creatures<br />
					in the mighty ocean<br />
					on mighty stakes;<br />
					likewise all the creatures of middle size<br />
					on stakes of middle size;<br />
					likewise all the creatures of minute size<br />
					on stakes of minute size.</p>
