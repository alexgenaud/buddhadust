					<p class="f4">Of a monk who has insight, monks, it may be expected that he will cultivate the Ariyan eightfold way, that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way. And how, monks, does a monk who has insight cultivate and make much of the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates right view, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right speech, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness, that is based on seclusion, that is based on dispassion, on cessation, that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration, which is based on detachment, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrendeer.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who has insight cultivates and makes much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>
