							<p>The 'doctrine of the deed' is the view that kamma is a fact. The view that there is no action necessary to become free from pain is the doctrine of 'non-action'. To free one's self from pain it is necessary to act in a way which ends kamma which is the intentional action of not acting in response to <i>taṇhā.</i> It is kamma which ends kamma and thus is not 'non-action.' The Pali here says: <i>'Taṇhāya pahānā kammam pahīyati. Kammassa pahānā dukkham pahīyati.</i> 'Letting go Thirst, kamma is let go. Kamma having been let go, pain is let go.' The qualification 'rooted in craving' is unnecessary and misleading: letting go thirst, all kamma is let go.</p>
