					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br />
					even so did he vanish from Jeta Grove<br />
					and appear among the Devas of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br />
					came to see the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus stood<br />
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great said this to those Devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends,<br />
					to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of being blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br />
					some beings here,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death<br />
					have been<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> reborn in the Happy Lot,<br />

					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>
