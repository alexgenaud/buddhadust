					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#uruvela">Uruvelā,</a><br />
					on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, under the Goatherds' Banyan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> after he had just attained enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as the Exalted One meditated in solitude,<br />
					there arose in his mind<br />
					this train of thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one sole way<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br />
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br />
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br />
					to the winning of the Method,<br />
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> should dwell in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br />

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br />

					to the winning of the Method,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now Brahma Sahampati,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					reading with his mind<br />
					the mind of the Exalted One,<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> his bent arm,<br />
					or draw in his arm stretched out, -<br />
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br />
					and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then drawing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					joining his hands<br />
					he raised them to the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus it is, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br />

					<p class="f4">Having so said<br />
