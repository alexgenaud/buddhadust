					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br />
					floods of good things,<br />
					that bring happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the first flood of merit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the second flood of merit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the third flood of merit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover he is a sage,<br />
					possessed of insight into the rise and fall of things,<br />
					insight which is Ariyan,<br />
					penetrating,<br />
					going on to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the fourth flood of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four floods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is no easy thing<br />
					to reckon up the measure of merit<br />
					that accrues to the Ariyan disciple<br />
					who is blessed with these four floods of merit,<br />
					these four floods of good things,<br />
					that bring happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">One cannot say they are thus and thus in quantity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, they are only to be described in terms like<br />
					'incalculable,<br />
					boundless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Desiring merit, in the good set firm,<br />
							Who cultivates the way to reach the Deathless,<br />
							He, winning to the essence of the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Rejoicing in destruction of the taints,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Quakes not to think: The Lord of Death will come.</p>
