					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I desire to dwell in solitude<br />
					for half a month.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not to be visited by any<br />
					save by him alone who brings my food."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord"<br />
					replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One<br />
					save the one who brought his food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at the end of that half-month the Exalted One,<br />
					leaving his solitude,<br />
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I have been dwelling partly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
