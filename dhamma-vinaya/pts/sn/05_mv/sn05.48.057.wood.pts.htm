					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard: On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#uruvela">Uruvelā,</a><br />
					on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br />
					under the Goatherds' Banyan,<br />
					just after his attainment of perfect enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> Now in the Exalted One, when he had retired to his solitary communing,<br />
					there arose this mental reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are five controlling faculties which,<br />
					cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					reading with his mind<br />
					the mental reflection of the Exalted One, -<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm<br />
					or bend his outstretched arm, -<br />
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br />
					and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					throwing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					stretch out his folded palms towards the Exalted One<br />
					and thus address him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">These five controlling faculties,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					have their end in the Deathless,<br />
					have their goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of energy<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of mindfulness<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of concentration<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of insight<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					has its end in the Deathless,<br />
					has its goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					have their end and goal in the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, sir,<br />
					when Kassapa was the supremely Enlightened One,<br />
					I was practising the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Men knew me then as Sahaka the monk.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then it was, sir, that by cultivating and making much of<br />
					these five controlling faculties,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and by restraining<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> sensual lust in things of sense,<br />
					on the breaking up of body,<br />
					I was reborn in the Happy World after death,<br />
					in the Brahma-World.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter men knew me as Brahma Sahampati,<br />
					Brahma Sahampati!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I know it!</p>

					<p class="f4">I see it, - that these five controlling faculties,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					do plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					do end and have their goal in the Deathless."</p>
