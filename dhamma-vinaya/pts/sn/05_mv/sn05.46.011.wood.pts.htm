					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, whatsoever creatures adopt the four postures,<br />
					now going,<br />
					now standing still,<br />
					now sitting,<br />
					now lying,<br />
					all do so in dependence on the earth;<br />
					even so, monks,<br />
					dependent on virtue,<br />
					supported by virtue,<br />
					does a monk cultivate the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					make much of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk,<br />
					dependent on virtue,<br />
					supported by virtue,<br />
					cultivate and make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is energy,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is zest,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is tranquillity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is concentration,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is equanimity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk,<br />
					dependent on virtue,<br />
					supported by virtue,<br />
					cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
