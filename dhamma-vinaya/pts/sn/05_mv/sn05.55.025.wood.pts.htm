					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a><br />
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br />
					who had made an end,<br />
					was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					one bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans,<br />
					whenever they met together in company,<br />
					were consumed with indignation,<br />
					and spoke angrily and scornfully about him<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A strange thing indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Nowadays-anyone may become a stream-winner,<br />
					inasmuch as Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br />
					who bas died,<br />
					is proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					one bound for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br />
					and took to drink!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma the Sakyan went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br />
					Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, Sarakāni the Sakyan,<br />
					who has died,<br />
					was proclaimed by the Exalted One a stream-winner,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of Sakyans, whenever they meet together in company,<br />

					<p class="f4">Why! Sarakāni the Sakyan failed in the training<br />

					<p class="f4">"Mahānāma, a lay-disciple<br />

					<p class="f4">He who would rightly apply the words<br />
					'A lay-disciple who has gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />

					nor has he won release.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he is blessed with<br />
					the controlling factor of faith,<br />
					the controlling factor of energy,<br />
					the controlling factor of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling factor of concentration<br />
					the controlling factor of controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also the things proclaimed by the Tathāgata<br />
					are moderately approved by him by insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this man, Mahānāma <br />
					is fully released from hell,<br />
					from rebirth in an animal's womb,<br />
					from the realm of ghosts,<br />
					he is fully released from the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					from the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once again, Mahānāma,<br />
					take the case of a certain one<br />
					who has not reached absolute loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has not reached absolute loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He has not reached absolute loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is he joyous and swift in wisdom,<br />
					nor has he won release.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he has just these conditions:<br />
					the controlling factor of faith,<br />
					the controlling factor of energy,<br />
					the controlling factor of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling factor of concentration<br />
					the controlling factor of controlling faculty of insight:<br />
					moreover he has merely faith,<br />
					merely affection for the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, also, Mahānāma is fully released from hell,<br />
					from rebirth in an animal's womb,<br />
					from the realm of ghosts,<br />
					he is fully released from the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					from the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now, Mahānāma, a bad field,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a bad piece of land,<br />
					not yet stubbed,<br />
					and the seeds (to be sown) are broken,<br />
					rotten,<br />
					spoiled<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> by wind and heat;<br />
					incapable of sprouting,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					badly planted,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the sky-god supplies no suitable rain.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Would those seeds come to growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord,"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, Mahānāma,<br />
					in this connexion,<br />
					when the Norm is wrongly preached,<br />
					ill expounded,<br />
					leads to no profit,<br />
					does not conduce to tranquillity,<br />
					and is not expounded by a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					I declare it like unto a bad field.</p>

					<p class="f4">The disciple who lives according to that Norm<br />
					and walks in accordance therewith,<br />
					who walks obedient thereto,<br />
					who practises its precepts, -<br />
					such I declare to be like that bad seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">But suppose, Mahānāma,<br />
					a good field,<br />
					a good piece of land, <a id="pg329"><span class="f2 g"><b>[329]</b></span></a> well stubbed,<br />
					and the seeds sown therein are unbroken,<br />
					not rotten,<br />
					unspoiled by wind and heat,<br />
					capable of sprouting,<br />
					happily planted,<br />
					and the sky-god supplies a constant rain, -<br />
					would those seeds come to growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely they would, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, just so, Mahānāma,<br />
					here the Norm is rightly preached,<br />
					well expounded,<br />
					it leads to profit,<br />
					it conduces to tranquillity,<br />
					it is expounded by a Fully Enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I declare it to be like unto a good field.</p>

					<p class="f4">The disciple who lives according to this Norm,<br />
					who walks in accordance therewith,<br />
					who walks obedient thereto,<br />
					who practises its precepts, -<br />
					such I declare to be the good seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Much more then do I declare<br />
					that Sarakanithe Sakyan is such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mahānāma, Sarakani the Sakyan<br />
					at the time of his death<br />
					was one who fulfilled the training to perfection."</p>
