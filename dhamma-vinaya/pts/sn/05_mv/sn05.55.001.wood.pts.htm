					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, although a rājah,<br />

					attended by a troop of nymphs,<br />
					supplied and provided with,<br />

					celestial pleasures of sense;<br />
					although he is possessed of these four things,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> -<br />

					from the realm of ghosts,<br />
					he is not released<br />
					from Hell,<br />
					the Way of Woe,<br />
					the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, although an Ariyan disciple<br />
					lives on gathered scraps,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					though he be clothed in rags,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

					from Hell,<br />
					the Way of Woe,<br />
					from the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four things?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is possessed<br />
					of unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">(He has faith that)</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering faith in the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is possessed<br />
					of the virtues loved by the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the four things he is possessed of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there is the winning of four continents,<br />
					and there is the winning of the four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">But to win four continents<br />
					is not worth a sixteenth part<br />
					of the winning of the four things."</p>
