					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever monks are possessed of virtue,<br />
					possessed of concentration,<br />
					possessed of insight,<br />
					of release,<br />
					of release by knowledge and insight -<br />
					the very sight of such brings much profit, I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">The very hearing about<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> such monks brings much profit, I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">To visit such,<br />
					to sit beside<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> them,<br />
					to remember such,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to follow such in giving up the world<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					brings great profit, I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing the teaching of such monks<br />
					one dwells aloof in two forms of aloofness, to wit:<br />
					of body and of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, so dwelling aloof,<br />
					remembers that Norm-teaching<br />
					and turns it over in his mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk, so dwelling aloof,<br />
					remembers and turns over in his mind<br />
					the teaching of the Norm,<br />
					it is then that the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness is established<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> in that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he cultivates the limb of wisdom which is mindfulness,<br />
					then it is that the monk's culture of it comes to perfection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he, dwelling mindful,<br />
					with full recognition<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					investigates and applies insight<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> to that teaching of the Norm<br />
					and comes to close scrutiny of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, at such time as a monk,<br />
					dwelling thus mindful,<br />
					with full recognition<br />
					investigates and applies insight<br />
					to that <a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> teaching of the Norm,<br />
					then it is that the limb of wisdom which is Norm-investigation<br />
					is established in that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is when he cultivates the limb of wisdom which is Norm-in-vestigation that,<br />
					as he comes to close scrutiny of it,<br />
					by his culture of it,<br />
					it comes to perfection.</p>

					<p class="f4">As with full recognition<br />
					he investigates and applies insight<br />
					to that Norm-teaching,<br />
					then unshaken energy<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> is established in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, at such time as unshaken energy<br />
					is established in a monk<br />
					who with full recognition<br />
					is investigating,<br />
					applying insight<br />
					and coming to close scrutiny of that Norm-teaching,<br />
					then it is that the limb of wisdom which is energy<br />
					is established in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he cultivates this limb of wisdom,<br />
					at such time,<br />
					by culture of it,<br />
					does it come to perfection in that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who has energy established<br />
					there arises zest,<br />
					which is free from carnal taint.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, when zest free from carnal taint arises in a monk<br />
					who has energy established,<br />
					then it is that the limb of wisdom which is zest<br />
					is established in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he cultivates this limb of wisdom,<br />
					at such time,<br />
					by culture of it,<br />
					does it come to perfection in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of one who is zestful<br />
					body is tranquil<br />
					and mind is tranquil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, when a monk who is zestful<br />
					has body and mind tranquillized,<br />
					then it is that the limb of wisdom which is tranquillity<br />
					is established in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he cultivates this,<br />
					at such time,<br />
					by his culture of it,<br />
					it comes to perfection in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy is he whose body is tranquillized.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of him that is happy<br />
					the mind is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, when the mind is concentrated<br />
					in a monk whose body is tranquillized,<br />
					at such time the limb of wisdom which is concentration<br />
					is established in that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he cultivates this limb of wisdom,<br />
					by his culture of it<br />
					does it come to perfection.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is now thorough overseer<br />
					of his mind thus calmed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, when he becomes a careful looker-on<br />
					of his mind thus calmed,<br />
					then it is that the limb of wisdom which is <a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> equanimity<br />
					is established in a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he cultivates it,<br />
					at such time<br />
					by his culture of it<br />
					does it come to perfection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, when the seven limbs of wisdom are thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					seven fruits,<br />
					seven advantages<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> may be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this very life, beforehand,<br />
					he establishes realization<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>:<br />
					and if he do not so beforehand,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in this very life,<br />
					at any rate he establishes realization at the time of his death.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if in this very life, beforehand,<br />
					he do not establish realization,<br />
					nor do so at the time of death,<br />
					then, through having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					he wins release midway.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					nor yet at the time of death,<br />
					and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					win not release midway, -<br />
					then at any rate,<br />
					after having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					he wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					nor yet at the time of death,<br />
					and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					win not release midway, -<br />
					nor wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time,<br />
					at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					he wins release without much trouble.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					nor yet at the time of death,<br />
					and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					win not release midway, -<br />
					nor wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time,<br />
					nor wins release without much trouble,<br />
					at any rate, by having <a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					then he wins release with some trouble.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, if he do not establish perfect insight, beforehand,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					nor yet at the time of death,<br />
					and if he, by wearing down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					win not release midway, -<br />
					nor wins release by reduction of his (allotted) time,<br />
					nor wins release without much trouble,<br />
					nor wins release with some trouble,<br />
					at any rate, by having worn down the five fetters of the lower sort,<br />
					then he is 'one who goes upstream,'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> and he goes to the Pure Abodes.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, when the seven limbs of wisdom are thus cultivated,<br />
					these seven fruits,<br />
					these seven advantages<br />
					may be looked for.</p>
