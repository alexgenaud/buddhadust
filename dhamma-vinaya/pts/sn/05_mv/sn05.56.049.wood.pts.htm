					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, a man should lay down on Sineru, lord of mountains,<br />
					seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as beans.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Wliich is the more,<br />
					those seven grains of gravel as large as beans laid there,<br />
					or Sineru, lord of mountains?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg385"><span class="f2 g"><b>[385]</b></span></a> "Why, lord, this is greater,<br />
					this Sineru, lord of mountains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Very small are the seven grains of gravel laid down as large as beans.</p>

					<p class="f4">They cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared with it:<br />
					they do not come to the merest fraction of a part<br />
					when compared with Sineru, lord of mountains."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, monks, for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br />
					for a person of understanding,<br />
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up,<br />
					and infinitely small<br />
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction of a part of it,<br />
					when set beside that Ill<br />
					which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up, -<br />
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the man who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
