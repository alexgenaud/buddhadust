					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, Sineru, lord of mountains,<br />
					should come to<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> extinction,<br />
					should come to an end,<br />
					all save seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as beans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the more,<br />
					that part of Sineru, lord of mountains,<br />
					which has come to extinction,<br />
					come to an end,<br />
					or those seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as beans?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, that part of Sineru, lord of mountains,<br />
					is the more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Very small are seven grains of gravel<br />
					as large as beans.</p>

					<p class="f4">They cannot be reckoned,<br />
					they cannot be compared with it:<br />
					they do not come to the merest fraction of a part<br />
					when set beside all that part of Sineru<br />
					which is extinguished,<br />
					which has come to an end."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just so, monks, for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br />
					for a person of understanding,<br />
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up,<br />
					and infinitely small<br />
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction of a part of it,<br />
					when set beside that Ill<br />
					which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up, -<br />
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most,<br />
					for the man who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
