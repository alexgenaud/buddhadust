					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.55.007.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans,</a><br />
					together with a great company of monks,<br />
					and had reached Bamboo Gate,<br />
					a brahmin village of the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the folk of Bamboo Gate,<br />
					both brahmins and housefathers,<br />
					heard the report:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is rumoured that<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> master<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Gotama,<br />
					the recluse,<br />
					the Sakyan's son,<br />
					he who went forth from a Sakyan clan,<br />
					is on his rounds among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a great company of monks,<br />
					and has reached Bamboo Gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there is a goodly rumour gone abroad of Gotama<br />
					that Exalted One,<br />
					to this effect:<br />
					'He it is,<br />
					the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world,<br />
					together with the world of Devas,<br />
					Maras<br />
					and Brahmas,<br />
					with its host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					both of devas and men,<br />
					having realized it with his own full knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He proclaims the Norm,<br />
					which is goodly in its beginning,<br />
					in its middle<br />
					and its ending,<br />
					both in its spirit and its letter;<br />
					he makes clear the holy life<br />
					in all its fullness and purity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well indeed<br />
					for us to have sight of such Arahants!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So those brahmins and housefathers of Bamboo Gate<br />
					went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					some of them saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side:<br />
					some <a id="pg308"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span></a> conversed with the Exalted One, and,<br />
					after the exchange of greetings and courtesies,<br />
					they also sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some stretched out their clasped hands towards the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some announced their names and families to the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side:<br />
					while some others just sat down at one side<br />
					without saying anything.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat<br />
					the brahmins and housefathers said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, we are people of such desires,<br />
					such wishes,<br />
					such intentions<br />
					as these:</p>

					<p class="f4">'O may we live in a crowded<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> house<br />
					encumbered with children!</p>

					<p class="f4">May we enjoy the use of Benares sandalwood!</p>

					<p class="f4">May we deck ourselves with garlands and unguents!</p>

					<p class="f4">May we handle gold and silver!</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br />
					after death<br />
					may we be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br />
					the Heaven World!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray let master Gotama teach us,<br />
					who have such desires,<br />
					such wishes<br />
					and such intentions,<br />
					a doctrine by which we may live in a crowded house<br />
					encumbered with children,<br />
					may enjoy the use of Benares sandalwood<br />
					may deck ourselves with garlands and unguents<br />
					may handle gold and silver<br />
					and when body breaks up,<br />
					after death<br />
					may we be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br />
					the Heaven World."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, housefathers, I will teach you a Norm-method<br />
					which brings profit to oneself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay close attention<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, master,"<br />
					replied the brahmins and housefathers<br />
					to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefathers, of what sort is the Norm-method<br />
					which brings profit to self?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this matter, housefathers,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I,<br />
					fond of my life,<br />
					not wanting to die,<br />
					fond of pleasure<br />
					and averse from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose someone should rob me of my life<br />
					(fond of life as I am<br />
					and not wanting to die,<br />
					fond of pleasure<br />
					and averse from pain),<br />
					it would not be a thing<br />
					pleasing or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, in my turn,<br />
					should rob of his life<br />
					one fond of his life,<br />
					not wanting to die,<br />
					one fond of pleasure<br />
					and averse from pain,<br />
					it would not be a thing<br />
					pleasing or delightful to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a state that is not pleasant or delightful to me<br />
					<a id="pg309"><span class="f2 g"><b>[309]</b></span></a> must be so to him also:<br />
					and a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me, -<br />
					how could I inflict<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of such reflection<br />
					he himself abstains<br />
					from taking the life of creatures<br />
					and he encourages others so to abstain,<br />
					and speaks in praise of so abstaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards bodily conduct<br />
					he is utterly pure.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefathers,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should take<br />
					with thievish intent<br />
					what I have not given him,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasing or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, in my turn,<br />
					should take from another<br />
					with thievish intent<br />
					what he has not given me,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasing or delightful to him:<br />
					and a state that is not pleasant,<br />
					that is not delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does not please me,<br />
					what does not delight me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of this reflection,<br />
					he himself abstains from taking what is not given,<br />
					and he encourages others so to abstain,<br />
					he speaks in praise of so abstaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards bodily conduct<br />
					he is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefathers, the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should have intercourse with my wives,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasing or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, in my turn,<br />
					should so behave with another's wives,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasing or delightful to him:<br />
					and a state that is not pleasant,<br />
					that is not delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does not please me,<br />
					what does not delight me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of this reflection,<br />
					he himself abstains from wrong practice in respect of sense desires,<br />
					and he encourages others to do so,<br />
					he speaks in praise of such abstinence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards personal conduct<br />
					he is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefathers,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should spoil my fortune<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by lying speech,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, in my turn,<br />
					should spoil another's fortune<br />
					by lying speech,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to him:<br />
					and a state that <a id="pg310"><span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span></a> is not pleasant,<br />
					that is not delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does not please me,<br />
					what does not delight me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of this reflection<br />
					he himself abstains from lying speech,<br />
					he encourages another so to abstain,<br />
					speaks in praise of abstaining therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards conduct in speech<br />
					he is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefathers,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should estrange me from my friends<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> by slander,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I in my turn<br />
					should estrange him from his friends,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to him:<br />
					and a state that is not pleasant,<br />
					that is not delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does not please me,<br />
					what does not delight me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of this reflection,<br />
					he himself abstains from slander<br />
					he encourages anoher so to abstain,<br />
					speaks in praise of abstaining therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards conduct in speech<br />
					he is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefathers,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should treat me with harsh speech<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I in my turn<br />
					should treat another with harsh speech,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to him:<br />
					and a state that is not pleasant,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards conduct in speech<br />
					he is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefathers,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">If someone should treat me with pointless,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> frivolous talk,<br />
					it would not be a thing pleasant or delightful to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I in my turn should so treat him,<br />
					it would not be pleasant or delightful to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a state that is unpleasant,<br />
					not delightful to me<br />
					must be so to him also,<br />
					and a state that is not pleasant,<br />
					not delightful to me, -<br />
					how could I inflict that upon another?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a result of this reflection,<br />
					he himself abstains from pointless, frivolous talk:<br />
					he encourages another to do so,<br />
					he speaks in praise of so doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as regards conduct in speech<br />
					he is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddba, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He it <a id="pg300"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span></a> is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefathers,<br />
					since the Ariyan disciple is blessed with these seven good conditions<br />
					and these four desirable points of vantage,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					if he so desired,<br />
					he could himself<br />
					declare with surety of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Cut off for me is Purgatory,<br />
					cut off the Way of Woe<br />
					and the Downfall!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured am I,<br />
					bound for enlightenment!'"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					the brahmins and housefathers of Bamboo Gate<br />
					exclaimed to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise up what is fallen,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point the way to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in diners ways<br />
					has the Norm been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">We go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama accept us<br />
					as lay-disciples<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					so long as life may last,<br />
					who have taken refuge in him!"</p>
