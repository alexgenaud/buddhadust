<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 5. Maha Vagga, 56. Sacca Samyutta, 5. Papata Vaggo, Sutta 41. This sutta deals with the thoughts one should and should not dwell on. It should be read when the issue of what the Buddha did not discuss comes up. Here by the juxtaposition of the issues not to be considered with those which should be thought about it is clear that this is not a matter of keeping things a mystery but of what is and what is not a matter pertaining to the goal." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>,<br />
					in Bamboo Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks,<br />
					a certain man left Rājagaha<br />
					with this intention:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will speculate about the world';</p>

					<p class="f4">and be came to Sumāgavā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Lotus Pond.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching it<br />
					he sat down on the bank of the lotus pond<br />
					and fell to speculating<br />
					about the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, that man saw<br />
					an army with its four divisions<br />
					(of elephants and horses, chariots and infantry)<br />
					entering a lotus stalk.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing it he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I must be mad!</p>

					<p class="f4">I must be out of my mmd,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for I have seen<br />
					what does not exist in the world!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, monks, that man went into the town<br />
					and told a great crowd of folk:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sirs, I must be mad!</p>

					<p class="f4">I must be out of my mmd,<br />
					for I have seen<br />
					what does not exist in the world!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How's that, good fellow?</p>

					<p class="f4">How are you mad?</p>

					<p class="f4">How are you out of your mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">What have you seen that's not in the world?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, sirs, it's like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">I left Rājagaha with this intention:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will speculate about the world",</p>

					<p class="f4">and I came to Sumāgavā Lotus Pond.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I got there<br />
					I sat down on the bank of the pond<br />
					and fell to speculating<br />
					about the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, sirs, I saw an army<br />
					with its four divisions<br />
					entering a lotus stalk.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, sirs, is how I must be mad,<br />
					must be out of my mind,<br />
					for I saw what does not exist in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg378"><span class="f2 g"><b>[378]</b></span></a> "Indeed, good fellow,<br />
					you are mad,<br />
					you are out of your mind!</p>

					<p class="f4">What you saw does not exist in the world!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, what that man saw<br />
					was real,<br />
					not unreal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks,<br />
					the hosts of the Devas and the Asuras<br />
					were arrayed for battle,<br />
					and in that battle<br />
					the Devas won the day,<br />
					the Asuras were defeated;<br />
					and the Asuras,<br />
					defeated and panic-stricken,<br />
					entered Asura Town<br />
					by way of a lotus-stalk,<br />
					in terror of the Devas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br />
					reason not about the world<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Eternal is the world or<br />
					Not eternal is the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Finite is the world or<br />
					Infinite is the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Life is the same as body or<br />
					Life and body are different.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata exists after death or<br />
					The Tathāgata exists not after death; or<br />
					He both exists and exists not after death; or<br />
					The Tathāgata neither exists nor not-exists after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I say this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, such reasonings are not concerned with profit,<br />
					are not concerned with the rudiments of the holy life:<br />
					conduce not to revulsion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					to tranquillity,<br />
					to comprehension,<br />
					to perfect wisdom,<br />
					conduces not to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">When ye reason, monks, reason thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I say so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks, such reasonings are concerned with profit,<br />
					concerned with the rudiments of the holy life:<br />
					conduce to revulsion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					to tranquillity,<br />
					to comprehension,<br />
					to the perfect wisdom<br />
					conduce to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
