					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"On a certain occasion, monks,<br />
					I was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#uruvela">Uruvela,</a><br />
					on the bank of the river Nerañjarā,<br />
					under the Goatherds' Banyan,<br />
					after I had just attained enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> Then, monks, as I meditated in solitude,<br />
					this train of thought arose in my mmd:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the one sole way<br />
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br />
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br />
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br />
					to the winning of the Method,<br />
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should dwell as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					by restraing the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the one sole way<br />
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br />
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br />
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br />
					to the winning of the Method,<br />
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					reading with his mind my mind,<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or draw in his outstretched arm, -<br />
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati vanish from the Brahma World<br />
					and appear before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					drawing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					joined his hands<br />
					and raised them to me<br />
					and thus spoke:</p>

					<p class="f4">'True it is, O Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">True it is, O Happy One!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the one sole way<br />
					that leads to the purification of beings,<br />
					to the utter passing beyond sorrow and grief,<br />
					to the destruction of woe and lamentation,<br />
					to the winning of the Method,<br />
					to the realizing of Nibbāna,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk should dwell in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying he added this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Beholding this one way for ending birth,<br />
							This way the All-compassionate doth know:<br />
							By this way men ere now have crossed the flood,<br />
							Shall cross and do cross now.'"</p>
