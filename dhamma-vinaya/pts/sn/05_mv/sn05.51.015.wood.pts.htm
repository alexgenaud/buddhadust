					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a><br />
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin Uṇṇābha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the brahmin Uṇṇābha said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is it, master Ānanda,<br />
					for which the holy life is lived<br />
					under Gotama the recluse?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the sake of abandoning desire,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> brahmin,<br />
					the holy life is lived<br />
					under the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is there any way,<br />
					is there any practice, master Ānanda,<br />
					for abandoning this desire?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg244"><span class="f2 g"><b>[244]</b></span></a> "There is a way, brahmin,<br />
					there is a practice<br />
					for abandoning this desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, master Ānanda,<br />
					what is that way<br />
					and that practice?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein a monk cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					desire,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					energy,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					thought,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates that basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are<br />
					investigation,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration<br />
					and struggle.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is the way,<br />
					this is the practice<br />
					for the abandoning of this sensual desire."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"If that be so, master Ānanda,<br />
					it were a task without end,<br />
					not one with an end.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That he should get rid of one desire<br />
					by means of another desire<br />
					is an impossible thing."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brahmin, I will just question you in this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Was there not previously<br />
					desire in you (urging you) thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will go to the Park'?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you got to the Park,<br />
					was not that appropriate<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> desire abated?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, indeed it was, master."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Was there not previously<br />
					energy in you (urging you) thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will go to the Park'?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you got there,<br />
					was not that appropriate energy abated?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes indeed, master."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Was there not previously<br />
					work of thought in you (urging you) thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will go to the Park'?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you got there,<br />
					was not that appropriate work of thought abated?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes indeed, master."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, was there not previously in you<br />
					consideration (which urged you) thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will go to the Park'?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you got to the Park,<br />
					was not that appropriate consideration abated?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> "Yes indeed, master."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well then, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">That monk who is Arahant,<br />
					one in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed,<br />
					who has lived the life,<br />
					done the task,<br />
					lifted the burden,<br />
					who is a winner of his own welfare,<br />
					who has outworn the fetters of rebirth,<br />
					one who is released by perfect insight, -<br />
					that desire<br />
					which he had previously<br />
					to attain Arahantship,<br />
					now that Arahantship is won,<br />
					that appropriate desire is abated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That energy<br />
					which was in him previously<br />
					for winning Arahantship,<br />
					now that Arahantship is won,<br />
					that appropriate energy is abated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That work of thought for winning Arahantship<br />
					which he had before,<br />
					now that Arahantship is won,<br />
					that appropriate work of thought is abated.</p>

					<p class="f4">That investigation<br />
					for winning Arahantship which he had before,<br />
					that appropriate investigation is abated,<br />
					now that Arahantship is won.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to that,<br />
					what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is so,<br />
					is it a task that has an end,<br />
					or is it endless?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sure enough, master Ānanda,<br />
					since this is so,<br />
					it is a task that has an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not an endless task.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, master Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, master Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should lift up the fallen,<br />
					discover the hidden,<br />
					point out the way to the bewildered,<br />
					show a light in the gloom, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now they that have eyes to see||<br />
					can see objects,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">even so in divers ways<br />
					has the Exalted One expounded the truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord,<br />
					do go for refuge to the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Ānanda accept me as a follower,<br />
					as one who from this time forth<br />
					even to life's end<br />
					hath gone to him for refuge."</p>
