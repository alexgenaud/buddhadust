					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of ease,<br />
					the controlling faculty of discomfort,<br />
					the controlling faculty of happiness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of unhappiness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling faculty of ease?</p>

					<p class="f4">That ease which is bodily,<br />
					that agreeableness which is bodily,<br />
					that ease,<br />
					that agreeableness<br />
					which is experienced<br />
					when it arises from bodily contact, -<br />
					that, monks, is called<br />
					'the controlling faculty of ease.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling faculty of discomfort?</p>

					<p class="f4">That discomfort which is bodily,<br />
					that disagreeableness which is bodily,<br />
					that discomfort,<br />
					that disagreeableness<br />
					which is experienced<br />
					when it arises from bodily contact, -<br />
					that, monks, is called<br />
					'the controlling faculty of discomfort.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling faculty of happiness?</p>

					<p class="f4">That happiness which is mental,<br />
					that agreeableness which is mental,<br />
					that happiness,<br />
					that agreeableness<br />
					which is experienced<br />
					when it arises from mental contact, -<br />
					that, monks, is called<br />
					'the controlling faculty of happiness.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling faculty of unhappiness?</p>

					<p class="f4">That pain which is mental,<br />
					that disagreeableness which is mental,<br />
					that pain,<br />
					that disagreeableness<br />
					which is experienced<br />
					when it arises from mental contact, -<br />
					that, monks, is called<br />
					'the controlling faculty of unhappiness.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the controlling faculty of indifference?</p>

					<p class="f4">That bodily or mental feelmg experienced,<br />
					which is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, -<br />
					that, monks, is called<br />
					'the controlling faculty of indifference.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, in these cases,<br />
					the controlling faculty of ease<br />
					and the controlling faculty of happiness<br />
					should be regarded as pleasurable feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise the controlling faculty of discomfort<br />
					and that of unhappiness<br />
					must be regarded as painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise the controlling faculty of indifference<br />
					must be regarded as feeling that is neither pleasant nor painful.</p>

					<p class="f4">These indeed, monks, are the five controlling faculties."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, monks, that these five controlling faculties,<br />
					from being five, become three,<br />
					and again, from being three,<br />
					they become five in turn.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
