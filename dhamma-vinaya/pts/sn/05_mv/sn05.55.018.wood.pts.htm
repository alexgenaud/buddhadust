					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Moggallāna the Great was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or draw in his outstretched <a id="pg319"><span class="f2 g"><b>[319]</b></span></a> arm, -<br />
					even so did he vanish from Jeta Grove<br />
					and appear among the Devas of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br />
					came to see the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and stood at one side.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus stood<br />
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great said this to those Devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a good thing, friends, to be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />

					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />

							<p>"Idha" most frequently refers to "In this Dhamma," or "In this case." When "This World" is spoken of, it is the world of creation. The entire cosmos. Again, to assume a distinction in 'space' between the heavens and earth (here vs. there) is to impose a view of the construction of the universe that is particular to the human mind and moreso to that of the Judeao/Christian and even moreso to the English mind. Finally, M's 'here,' in this case, may reasonably have been speaking of the Realm of the Thirty and Three. These gods are subject to rebirth as are all living beings and need to know the way to rebirth in the heavens as much as any other.</p>
