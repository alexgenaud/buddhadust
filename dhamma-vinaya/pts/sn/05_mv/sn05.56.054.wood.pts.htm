					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.56.054.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, that where these great rivers,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					Ganges,<br />
					Yamunā,<br />
					Aciravatī,<br />
					Sarabhū<br />
					and Mahī<br />
					flow together,<br />
					meet together,<br />
					the water wastes away<br />
					and comes to an end,<br />
					except two or three drops.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater:<br />
					the water at the confluence,<br />
					which has wasted away<br />
					and come to an end,<br />
					or those two or three drops that remain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, this water at the confluence,<br />
					that has wasted away,<br />
					come to an end,<br />
					is the greater.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exceeding small<br />
					are those two or three drops that remain:<br />
					they cannot be reckoned,<br />
					they cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not amount to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of the water at the confluence, -<br />
					these two or three drops of water thus drawn up."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, just so, monks,<br />
					for the Ariyan disciple who is blessed with vision,<br />
					for the person who has understanding,<br />
					far greater is this Ill which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up,<br />
					and infinitely small<br />
					is that Ill which remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">It cannot be reckoned,<br />
					cannot be compared therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It does not come to the merest fraction<br />
					of a part of it<br />
					when set beside that Ill<br />
					which he has destroyed,<br />
					which he has used up, -<br />
					that is, it is just a period of seven lives at most<br />
					for the man who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the arising of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the ceasing of Ill'<br />
					who understands,<br />
					as it really is:<br />
					the meaning of:<br />
					'this is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monk, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of Ill.'"</p>
