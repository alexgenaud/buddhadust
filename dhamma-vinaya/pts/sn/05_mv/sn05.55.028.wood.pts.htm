					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when the fivefold guilty dread<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is allayed in the Ariyan disciple<br />
					and he is possessed of the four limbs of stream-winning,<br />
					and has well seen and well penetrated<br />
					the Ariyan Method<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> by insight,<br />
					he, if he so desire,<br />
					may himself proclaim thus of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one who has cut off the doom of Hell,<br />

					cut off is the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					the Downfall;<br />
					a Stream-winner am I,<br />
					one not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					bound for enlightenment!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, what is the fivefold guilty dread<br />
					that is allayed in him?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that guilty dread, housefather,<br />
					which he who kills begets -<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					as a result of his killing;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread <a id="pg334"><span class="f2 g"><b>[334]</b></span></a><br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That same guilty dread, housefather,<br />
					which he who speaks falsehood begets -<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					as a result of his false speech;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread<br />
					about the future life,<br />
					which be who speaks falsehood begets;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					in this very life,<br />
					as a result of his addiction to the negligence caused by liquor and intoxicants;</p>

					<p class="f4">it is that guilty dread<br />

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is the guilty dread that is allayed in him.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And with what four limbs of stream-winning is he blessed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, an Ariyan disciple is blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves<br />
					by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is blessed<br />
					with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four limbs of stream-winning with which he is blessed.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, housefather, is the Ariyan Method<br />
					which he has well seen<br />
					and well penetrated by insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					well and thoroughly attends<br />
					to the arising-by-way-of-cause,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This being,<br />
					that is.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the arising of this,<br />
					that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">This not being,<br />
					that is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the ceasing of this,<br />
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus conditioned by ignorance,<br />
					activities come to pass.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by the activities,<br />
					consciousness:<br />
					conditioned by consciousness,<br />
					name-and-shape:<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape,<br />
					sense:<br />
					conditioned by sense,<br />
					contact:<br />
					conditioned by contact,<br />
					feeling:<br />
					conditioned by feeling,<br />
					craving:<br />
					conditioned by craving,<br />
					grasping:<br />
					conditioned by grasping,<br />
					becoming:<br />
					conditioned by becoming,<br />
					birth:<br />
					conditioned by birth,<br />
					old age and death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow and despair<br />
					come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the arising of this whole mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading and ceasing of ignorance<br />
					comes the ceasing of activities:<br />
					from ceasing of activities,<br />
					ceasing of consciousness:<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness,<br />
					ceasing of name- <a id="pg335"><span class="f2 g"><b>[335]</b></span></a> and-shape:<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape,<br />
					ceasing of sense:<br />
					from ceasing of sense,<br />
					ceasing of contact:<br />
					from ceasing of contact,<br />
					ceasing of feeling:<br />
					from ceasing of feeling,<br />
					ceasing of craving:<br />
					from ceasing of craving,<br />
					ceasing of grasping:<br />
					from ceasing of grasping,<br />
					ceasing of becoming:<br />
					from ceasing of becoming,<br />
					ceasing of birth:<br />
					from ceasing of birth,<br />
					ceasing of old age and death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow and despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this whole mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Ariyan Method which he has well seen and wrell penetrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, since in the Ariyan disciple this fivefold guilty dread is allayed,<br />
					since he is blessed with these four limbs of stream-winning,<br />
					and has well seen<br />
					and well penetrated<br />
					this Ariyan Method,<br />
					he, if he so desire,<br />
					may himself proclaim of himself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one who has cut off the doom of Hell,<br />
					of rebirth in the womb of an animal,<br />
					in the Realm of Ghosts,<br />
					the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stream-winner am I,<br />
					not doomed to the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					bound for enlightenment!'"</p>
