					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As a matter concerning the outside,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> monks,<br />
					I see no other single factor<br />
					so potent for the arismg of the seven limbs of wisdom as<br />
					friendship with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend what is lovely<br />
					we may expect that he will cultivate<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					that he will make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk<br />
					who is a friend of what is lovely<br />
					cultivate and make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is energy,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is zest,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is tranquillity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is concentration,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is equanimity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk,<br />
					who is a friend of what is lovely<br />
					cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom."</p>
