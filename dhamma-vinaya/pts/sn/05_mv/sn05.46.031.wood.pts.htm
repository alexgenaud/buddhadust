The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that whatever is skillful is based on being careful and being careful is considered the most skillful of skillful things. He then tells them that one who is careful will develop the seven dimensions of awakening." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One once addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever conditions, monks,<br />
					are the constituent parts of good and bad,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but are on the side of<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> goodness,<br />
					all of them have their root in earnestness,<br />
					converge in earnestness;<br />
					earnestness is reckoned the chief of those conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the monk who is earnest<br />
					we may expect that he will cultivate<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					that he will make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does the earnest monk<br />
					cultivate and make much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is energy,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is zest,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is tranquillity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is concentration,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is equanimity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk who is earnest<br />
					cultivates the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					makes much of the seven limbs of wisdom.</p>
