					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the devas are glad to talk<br />
					to one who is blessed with four things.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is, the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Happy One,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpsassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those devas<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> who,<br />
					being likewise blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					have deceased here<br />
					and risen up there,<br />
					think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with just the same unwavering loyalty to the Buddha as ourselves,<br />
					who deceased there<br />
					and rose up here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come hither<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> into the company of the devas.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Norm<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br />
					seen in this very life,<br />
					a thing not involving time,<br />
					inviting one to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be known for themselves by the wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those devas who,<br />
					being likewise blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm,<br />
					have deceased here<br />
					and risen up there,<br />
					think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with just the same unwavering loyalty to the Norm as ourselves,<br />
					who deceased there<br />
					and rose up here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come hither into the company of the devas.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with unwavering loyalty to the Order<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order,<br />
					walking uprightly,<br />
					walking in the right way,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples:<br />
					namely,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour are they,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands, -<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those devas who,<br />
					being likewise blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order,<br />
					have deceased here<br />
					and risen up there,<br />
					think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with just the same unwavering loyalty to the Order as ourselves,<br />
					who deceased there<br />
					and rose up here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come hither into the company of the devas.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one is blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues untainted (by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those devas who,<br />
					being likewise blessed the virtues dear to the Ariyans,<br />
					have deceased here<br />
					and risen up there,<br />
					think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with just the same virtues dear to the Ariyans, as ourselves,<br />
					who deceased there<br />
					and rose up here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come hither into the company of the devas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the devas are glad to talk to one who is blessed with these four things."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Bhk. Bodhi notes: <i>Woodward understands </i>sabhāgataṃ<i> to be resolvable into </i>sabhā + gataṃ,<i> "joined the company," but it is actually the accusative singular of the abstract noun </i>sabhāgatā,<i> "similarity."</i> He also notes regarding the concluding sentences: <i>Be and Ee have </i>ehi ti,<i> presumably understood as an imperative, while Se has </i>etīti,<i> which seems hard to explain. I suggest reading the singular future</i> ehiti and he constructs this sutta thus: <i>"... When the noble disciple possesses four things, the devas are elated and speak of his similarity [to themselves]. ...'As the noble disciple possesses the same confirmed confidence in the Buddha ~ that we possessed when we passed away there and were reborn here, he will come into the presence of the devas.'</i></p>
