					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika's</a> Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In Himalaya, king of mountains, monks,<br />
					there is a tract of land<br />
					that is rough and hard to cross,<br />
					where neither monkeys nor humans do resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise there is a tract of land<br />
					where monkeys do resort,<br />
					but not humans.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are tracts, monks, in Himalaya,<br />
					tracts of level country,<br />
					delightful spots,<br />
					where both monkeys and humans do resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">In those spots, monks,<br />
					a hunter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> sets a trap of pitch<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the monkeys' tracks<br />
					to catch the monkeys.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those monkeys who are free from folly and greed,<br />
					on seeing that pitch-trap<br />
					keep far away from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a greedy, foolish monkey<br />
					comes up to the pitch<br />
					and handles it with one paw,<br />
					and his paw sticks fast in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I'll free my paw,'</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>The trap is a post covered with tar. The Monkey to free his one hand does not grab the one hand with the other, but pushes on the post hoping that with that leverage he will free his stuck hand, but that sticks too. In this way the other appendages also get stuck. Woodward's 'grabs it' and 'grabs them' referring to the limbs, not the trap, breaks down when it is the head that gets stuck. And further grabing the one hand with the other would not necessarily result in the second hand getting stuck and might even give the monkey strength enough to free the hand. And how could even a monkey grab both hands with one foot? Etc.</p>

					<p class="f4">he seizes it with the other paw:<br />
					but that too sticks fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">To free both paws<br />
					he seizes them with one foot,<br />
					and that too sticks fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">To free both paws<br />
					and the one foot,<br />
					he lays hold of them<br />
					with the other foot:<br />
					but that too sticks fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">To free both paws and both feet<br />
					he lays hold of them<br />
					with his muzzle:<br />
					but that too sticks fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that monkey<br />
					thus trapped in five ways<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					lies down and howls,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					thus fallen on misfortune,<br />
					fallen on ruin,<br />
					a prey for the hunter,<br />
					to work his will upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the hunter spits him<br />
					and prepares him (for eating) there and then<br />
					over a charcoal fire,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and goes off at his pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so it is, monks,<br />
					with one who roams in wrong pastures<br />
					that belong to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore do not ye so roam.</p>

					<p class="f4">For to <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> those, monks, who so roam<br />
					Māra gets access,<br />
					Māra gets opportunity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is not one's own range,<br />
					but belongs to others?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the five sensual elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, monks, objects cognizable by the eye,<br />
					objects desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are sounds cognizable by the ear<br />
					sounds desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are scents cognizable by the nose<br />
					scents desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are savours cognizable by the tongue<br />
					savours desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are tangibles cognizable by the body<br />
					tangibles desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is not one's own range<br />
					but belongs to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye range your own pasture-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Keep to your own native beat.</p>

					<p class="f4">To those who range their own pasture-ground,<br />
					who keep their own native beat,<br />
					Māra gets no access,<br />
					Māra gets no opportunity of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is a monk's own pasture-ground?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his own native beat?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the four stations of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells as regards body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					arising from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is a monk's own pasture-ground,<br />
					this is his native beat.</p>
