<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya V: Maha Vagga; Chapter 45: Magga Samyutta, Sutta 2. Ānanda, probably speaking of friendship with other beggars, declares that it is 'half of the Brahma life' to be associated with the lovely. Gotama corrects him saying it is the whole of the Brahma life, but he is speaking of a close association and companionship with the Dhamma." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br />
					at Sakkara,<br />
					a Sakyan township.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The half of the holy life,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lord,<br />
					it is friendship with what is lovely,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					association with what is lovely,<br />
					intimacy with what is lovely!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the whole,<br />
					not the half,<br />
					of the holy life, -<br />
					this friendship,<br />
					this association,<br />
					this intimacy with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend,<br />
					an associate,<br />
					an intimate<br />
					of what is lovely<br />
					we may expect this, -<br />
					that he will develop the Ariyan eightfold way,<br />
					that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda, does such a monk<br />
					develop and make much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> Herein,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda, he cultivates right view,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right speech,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who is a friend,<br />
					an associate,<br />
					an intimate of what is lovely,<br />
					cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the method, Ānanda,<br />
					by which you are to understand<br />
					how the whole of this holy life<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy<br />
					with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda, beings liable to rebirth<br />
					are liberated from rebirth;<br />
					beings liable to decay,<br />
					liable to death,<br />
					liable to grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					are liberated therefrom<br />
					because of my friendship with what is lovely.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is by this method, Ānanda,<br />
					that you are to understand how<br />
					the whole of this holy life<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy with what is lovely."</p>
