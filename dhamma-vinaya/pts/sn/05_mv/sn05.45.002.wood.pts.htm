					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br />
					at Sakkara,<br />
					a Sakyan township.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The half of the holy life,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lord,<br />
					it is friendship with what is lovely,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					association with what is lovely,<br />
					intimacy with what is lovely!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the whole,<br />
					not the half,<br />
					of the holy life, -<br />
					this friendship,<br />
					this association,<br />
					this intimacy with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is a friend,<br />
					an associate,<br />
					an intimate<br />
					of what is lovely<br />
					we may expect this, -<br />
					that he will develop the Ariyan eightfold way,<br />
					that he will make much of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda, does such a monk<br />
					develop and make much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> Herein,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda, he cultivates right view,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">likewise right speech,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br />
					which is based on detachment,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Ānanda, is how a monk who is a friend,<br />
					an associate,<br />
					an intimate of what is lovely,<br />
					cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the method, Ānanda,<br />
					by which you are to understand<br />
					how the whole of this holy life<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy<br />
					with what is lovely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda, beings liable to rebirth<br />
					are liberated from rebirth;<br />
					beings liable to decay,<br />
					liable to death,<br />
					liable to grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					are liberated therefrom<br />
					because of my friendship with what is lovely.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is by this method, Ānanda,<br />
					that you are to understand how<br />
					the whole of this holy life<br />
					consists in friendship,<br />
					in association,<br />
					in intimacy with what is lovely.</p>
