					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seated<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, does the Exalted One understand<br />
					how to reach,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by psychic power<br />
					the Brahma World<br />
					in his mind-made body?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"I do understand<br />
					how to reach,<br />
					by psychic power<br />
					the Brahma World<br />
					in my mind-made body, Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, does the Exalted One understand how<br />
					by psychic power<br />
					to reach the Brahma World<br />
					in this (physical) body<br />
					of the four great elements?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do understand how<br />
					by psychic power<br />
					to reach the Brahma World<br />
					in this (physical) body<br />
					of the four great elements Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That the Exalted One, lord, should know<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> how to reach by psychic power<br />
					the Brahma World<br />
					both in his mind-made body<br />
					and in this (physical) body<br />
					of the four great elements<br />
					is a wonder and a marvel."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgatas are possessed of powers that are wonderful and marvellous.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Ānanda,<br />
					as the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and concentrates mind in body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at such time as he <a id="pg253"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></a> enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy,<br />
					then it is, Ānanda, that the Tathāgata's body<br />
					is more buoyant,<br />
					softer,<br />
					more plastic<br />
					and more radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, an iron ball,<br />
					if heated all day long,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is lighter<br />
					and softer,<br />
					more plastic<br />
					and more radiant,<br />
					even so at such time as the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<br />
					and concentrates mind in body, -<br />
					at such time as the Tathāgata enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy,<br />
					then it is, Ānanda,<br />
					that the Tathāgata's body<br />
					is more buoyant,<br />
					softer,<br />
					more plastic<br />
					and more radiant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, whenever the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<br />
					and mind in body,<br />
					and enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy, -<br />
					at such time, Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata's body<br />
					with but little effort<br />
					rises up from the ground<br />
					into the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then enjoys<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					manifold forms of magic power,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if it were through air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water.</p>

					<p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it,<br />
					as if on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br />
					like a bird upon the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br />
					though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br />
					he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br />
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Ānanda, a tuft of cotton seed<br />
					or a ball of thistledown,<br />
					lightly wafted on the wind,<br />
					with but little effort<br />
					rises up from the ground<br />
					into the air,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so at such time as the Tathāgata concentrates body in mind<br />
					and mind in body<br />
					and enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the consciousness of bliss and buoyancy, -<br />
					at such time, Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata's body<br />
					with but little effort<br />
					rises up from the ground<br />
					into the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He then enjoys<br />
