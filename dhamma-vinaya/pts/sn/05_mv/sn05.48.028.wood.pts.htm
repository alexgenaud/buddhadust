<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 48: Indriya Samyuttam: Sutta 28. The Buddha tells the bhikkhus how it was by thoroughly understanding the arising, the settling down, the pleasure and the escape from the six forces and having freed himself from them without residual fuel that he came to know the world and become self-awakened with the highest awakening, heart-freed, sure of freedom, certain that this was his last life, that rebirth was ended and there would be no more existing." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six sense-faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-faculty of eye,<br />
					the sense-faculty of ear,<br />
					the sense-faculty of nose,<br />
					the sense-faculty of tongue,<br />
					the sense-faculty of body<br />
					the sense-faculty of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the six sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, so long as I did not fully comprehend,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the arising<br />
					and the perishing of,<br />
					the satisfaction in,<br />
					the misery of,<br />
					and the escape from<br />
					these six faculties of <a id="pg181"><span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span></a> sense,<br />
					just so long, monks, did I not know the meaning of<br />
					'being enlightened<br />
					with supreme enlightenment<br />
					with regard to the world<br />
					and its devas,<br />
					its Maras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					with regard to the host<br />

					<p class="f4">But, monks, when I came to know fully,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the arising<br />
					and the perishing of,<br />
					the satisfaction in,<br />
					the misery of,<br />
					and the escape from<br />

					<p class="f4">Then arose in me knowledge and insight thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sure is my heart's release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>
