<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 48: Indriya Samyuttam: Sutta 28. The Buddha tells the bhikkhus how it was by thoroughly understanding the arising, the settling down, the pleasure and the escape from the six forces and having freed himself from them without residual fuel that he came to know the world and become self-awakened with the highest awakening, heart-freed, sure of freedom, certain that this was his last life, that rebirth was ended and there would be no more existing." />
