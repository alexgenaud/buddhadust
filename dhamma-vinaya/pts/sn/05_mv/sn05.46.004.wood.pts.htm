					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Sāriputta was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brother monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," replied those monks to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, there are these seven limbs of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br />
					the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the seven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these seven limbs of wisdom, friends,<br />
					in whichsoever I desire to abide<br />
					during the early part of the day,<br />
					in that limb of wisdom<br />
					I abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whichsoever limb of wisdom<br />
					I desire to abide<br />
					in the middle of the day,<br />
					in that I abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whichsoever limb of wisdom<br />
					I desire to abide<br />
					in the evening,<br />
					in that I abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friends, it is the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br />
					in such case I fully know that it is boundless in me,<br />
					or that it is well begun in me, or,<br />
					when it is established in me,<br />
					I fully know that it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, if it fails me,<br />
					I fully know that it is owing to this or <a id="pg59"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span></a> that cause.</p>
