					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sumbha,<br />
					at Desaka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> a district of the Sumbha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> Now the venerable Udāyī came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Udāyī said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Strange it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder it is, lord!<br />
					how strongly the affection and respect for the Exalted One,<br />
					the modesty and delicacy of feeling for him,<br />
					have worked<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly, lord, when I was living the life of a householder,<br />
					I was not much concerned about the Norm,<br />
					not much concerned about<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord, when I beheld the affection,<br />
					the respect,<br />
					the modesty<br />
					and delicacy of feeling<br />
					for the Exalted One,<br />
					I went forth from home<br />
					to the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me it was<br />
					that the Exalted One taught the Norm,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is body,<br />
					thus the arising of body,<br />
					thus the perishing of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is feeling,<br />
					thus the arising of feeling,<br />
					thus the perishing of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is perception,<br />
					thus the arising of perception,<br />
					thus the perishing of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus are the activities<br />
					thus the arising of the activities,<br />
					thus the perishing of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is consciousness,<br />
					thus the arising of consciousness,<br />
					thus the perishing of consciousness.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, when I had gone into solitude,<br />
					while pondering over the rise and fall<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of these five factors of existence,<br />
					I fully realized,<br />
					as in truth it is,<br />
					the meaning of</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill:<br />
					this is the arising of ill:<br />
					this is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I fully realized,<br />
					as in truth it is,<br />
					the meaning of</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br />
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, I fully grasped the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">I laid hold of<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> the way,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, lord, I laid hold of<br />
