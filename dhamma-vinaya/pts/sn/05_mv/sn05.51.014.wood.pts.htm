					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in East Park,<br />
					at the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a number of monks<br />
					were lodging on the ground-floor<br />
					of the terraced house of Migāra's mother,<br />
					and they were frivolous,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					empty-headed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					busybodies,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />

					unsteady,<br />
					not composed,<br />
					of flighty minds,<br />
					with senses uncontrolled.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One called to the venerable Moggallāna the Great, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna,<br />
					methinks our fellows in the holy life<br />
					who are lodging on the ground-floor<br />
					of this terraced house<br />
					are frivolous,<br />
					empty-headed,<br />
					busybodies,<br />
					of harsh speech,<br />
					loose in talk,<br />
					lacking concentration,<br />
					unsteady,<br />
					not composed,<br />
					of flighty minds,<br />
					with senses uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you, Moggallāna,<br />
					and give those monks a good stirring!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, lord,"<br />
					replied the venerable Moggallāna<br />
					to the Exalted One;<br />
					and he contrived such a feat of magic powder<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that with his great toe<br />
					he shook<br />
					and rattled<br />
					and made the terraced house of Migāra's mother<br />
					to quake<br />
					and quake again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat those monks were panic-stricken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Their hair stood on end.</p>

					<p class="f4">They stood aside exclaiming:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A wonder indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A miracle indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">This place is sheltered from the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg242"><span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span></a> This terraced house of Migāra's mother<br />

					it is deep-dug,<br />
					unshakable,<br />
					unquakable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet it shook,<br />
					it rattled,<br />
					it quaked<br />
					and quaked again!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One went towards those monks,<br />
					and when he reached them<br />
					said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is it, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why are ye panic-stricken,<br />
					with hair on end?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do ye stand thus aside?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"A wonder, lord, indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">A miracle, lord, indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">This place is sheltered from the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This terraced house of Migāra's mother<br />
					stands on deep-set foundations,<br />
					it is deep-dug,<br />
					unshakable,<br />
					unquakable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet it shook,<br />
					it rattled,<br />
					it quaked<br />
					and quaked again!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">This terraced house of Migāra's mother<br />
					was shaken,<br />
					it was rattled,<br />
					it quaked and quaked again.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was done by the monk Moggallāna,<br />
					with his big toe,<br />
					because he wished to give you a good stirring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, what think ye?</p>

					<p class="f4">By cultivating<br />
					and making much<br />
					of what conditions<br />
					is the monk Moggallāna<br />
					of such mighty magic power and majesty?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have their root in the Exalted One<br />
					(they have the Exalted One for their guide and their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed if the meaning of these words<br />
					should show itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing the meaning of them from the Exalted One<br />
					the monks will bear it in mind)."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then do ye listen, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through cultivating<br />
					and making much<br />
					of four bases of psychic power<br />
					that the monk Moggallāna<br />
					is of such mighty magic power<br />
					and majesty.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein (monks) the monk Moggallāna cultivates the basis of psychic power<br />
					of which the features are desire,<br />
					together with the co-factors<br />
					of concentration and struggle,<br />
					(with this intent):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus shall not my desire<br />
					be over-sluggish<br />
					nor overstrained.</p>

					<p class="f4">It shall not be inwardly cramped<br />
					nor outwardly diffuse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he abides fully conscious<br />

					<p class="f4">As (he is conscious of what is) in front, so behind:<br />
					as behind, so in front:<br />
					as below, so above:<br />
					as above, so below:<br />
					as by day, so by night:<br />
					as by night, so by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with wits alert,<br />

					he cultivates his mind to brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monk Moggallāna cultivates the basis of psychic power<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is by cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					these four bases of psychic power<br />
					that the monk Moggallāna
					enjoys manifold forms of psychic power, thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if it were through air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water.</p>

					<p class="f4">He walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it,<br />
					as if on solid ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">He travels sitting cross-legged through the air,<br />
					like a bird upon the wing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this moon and sun,<br />
					though they be of such mighty power and majesty,<br />
					he handles and strokes them with his hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as far as the Brahma World<br />
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					with deva-power of hearing,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br />
					he hears sounds<br />
					both of devas and of humans,<br />
					whether far or near.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					he knows the minds of other beings,<br />
					of other persons,<br />
					with his own mind grasping them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is lustful<br />
					he knows it to lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from lust<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is free from lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is full of hate<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is full of hate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is free from hate<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is free from hate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is deluded<br />

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is uncontrolled<br />
					he knows it to be a mind that is uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					he calls to mind his former births in divers ways thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					even ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births;<br />
					even a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind divers aeons of involution<br />
					divers aeons of evolution,<br />
					diverse aeons of involution and evolution.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such was I by name,<br />
					such was I by clan,<br />
					by caste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was I nourished,<br />
					thus did I undergo pleasure and pain,<br />
					such was my span of life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thence I deceased<br />
					and rose up so and so.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I dwelt,<br />
					of such and such a name,<br />
					of such a clan,<br />
					of such a caste,<br />
					so nourished;<br />
					such and such pleasure and pain did I undergo,<br />
					such my span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence deceased<br />
					I rose up in the present life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how<br />
					in fact and detail<br />
					he calls to mind in divers ways<br />
					his former births.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the monk Moggallāna has thus cultivated,<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					with the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br />
					he beholds beings:<br />
					as they decease and rise up (elsewhere)<br />
					he knows them,<br />
					both mean and exalted,<br />
					of features fair and foul,<br />
					gone to weal<br />
					or gone to woe,<br />
					according to their deeds, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! these good folk,<br />
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br />
					of evil words,<br />
					of evil thoughts,<br />
					scoffing at the noble ones,<br />
					of perverted views<br />
					and reaping the fruit of their perverted views, -<br />
					these folk,<br />
					on the dissolution of body,<br />
					after death arose again in the Waste,<br />
					the Downfall<br />
					and the Constant Round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah! and these good folk,<br />
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br />
					of good words,<br />
					of good thoughts,<br />
					not scoffing at the noble ones,<br />
					of sound views<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					on the dissolution of body,<br />
					after death arose again in the Happy Way,<br />
					the Heaven World.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of man,<br />
					does he behold beings<br />
					as they decease and rise up (elsewhere):<br />
					he knows them,<br />
					both mean and exalted,<br />
					of features fair and foul,<br />
					gone to weal<br />
					or gone to woe<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, it is by cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					these four bases of psychic power<br />
					that the monk Moggallāna,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					by his own unaided powers<br />
					he attains the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight,<br />
					that is free from the āsavas,<br />
					realizes it<br />
					and dwells therein."</p>
