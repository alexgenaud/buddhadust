					even so possession of virtue<br />

					the harbinger,<br />
					of the arising of the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a monk who is possessed of virtue, monks,<br />
					it may be expected that he will cultivate<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way,<br />
					that he will make much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br />
					who is possessed of virtue<br />
					cultivate and make much of<br />
					the Ariyan eightfold way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates right view,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right aim,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right speech,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right action,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right living,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right effort,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right mindfulness,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates right concentration,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of passion,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of hatred,<br />
					which ends in the restraint of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk who is possessed of virtue<br />
					cultivates and makes much of<br />
