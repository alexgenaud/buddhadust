					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vajjians">Vajjians</a><br />
					at Ukkāvela<br />
					on the river Ganges<br />
					together with a great company <a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> of monks,<br />
					not long after the passing away of Sāriputta and Moggallāna the Great.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Exalted One was seated in the open air,<br />
					surrounded by the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					observing that the Order of monks was become silent,<br />
					thus addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, truly this company seems empty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have passed away<br />
					my company is empty of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indifferent<br />
					as to that quarter<br />
					in which Sāriputta and Moggallāna are dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in past times<br />
					have been Arahants,<br />
					fully Enlightened Ones, -<br />
					each one of those Exalted Ones<br />
					had such a noble pair of disciples<br />
					as were Sāriputta and Moggallāna to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whosoever in future times<br />
					shall be Arahants,<br />
					fully Enlightened Ones,<br />
					each of them shall have such a noble pair of disciples<br />
					as were Sāriputta and Moggallāna to me.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder of disciples it is, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">A marvel of disciples it is, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">To think how they carry out the Master's teachings,<br />
					how they give advice accordantly,<br />
					how dear to the fourfold company,<br />
					how delightful,<br />
					how revered and sought after they must be.</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder it is, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">A marvel it is, monks,<br />
					in the Tathāgata!</p>

					<p class="f4">For though such a pair of disciples has passed away,<br />
					there is in the Tathāgata<br />
					no sorrow<br />
					or lamenting.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it possible, monks,<br />
					in the case of what is born,<br />
					what is become,<br />
					what is compounded,<br />
					what is transitory, -<br />
					how is it possible to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh I may it not perish'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks, from some mighty tree,<br />
					standing firm<br />
					and full of vigour,<br />
					the greater limbs should rot away:</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so monks,<br />
					from the mighty Order of monks,<br />
					standing firm<br />
					and full of vigour,<br />
					Sāriputta and Moggallāna have passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it possible, I say,<br />
					in the case if what is born,<br />
					what is become,<br />
					what is compounded,<br />
					what is transitory, -<br />
					how is it <a id="pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> possible to have one's wish fulfilled:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oh! may it not perish!'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, such a thing cannot be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br />
					do ye abide grounded on self,<br />
					self-refuged,<br />
					taking refuge in none other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye abide grounded on the Norm,<br />
					taking refuge in the Norm,<br />
					having none other refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks,<br />
					does a monk so abide?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks,<br />
					a monk abides in body contemplating body<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards feelings contemplating feelings<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind contemplating mind<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells as regards mind-states contemplating mind-states<br />
					(as transient),<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					having restrained the dejection in the world<br />
					that arises from coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk abides grounded on self,<br />
					self-refuged,<br />
					taking refuge in none other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever, monks,<br />
					either now<br />
					or when I have passed away,<br />
					shall abide grounded on self,<br />
					self-refuged,<br />
					taking refuge in none other;<br />
					grounded on the Norm,<br />
					with the Norm for refuge,<br />
					taking refuge in none other, -<br />
					they, monks,<br />
					shall be my monks,<br />
					they shall be atop of the gloom;<br />
					that is,<br />
					they who are anxious to learn."</p>
