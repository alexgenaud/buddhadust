<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 48: Indriya Samyuttam: Sutta 16. The Buddha tells the bhikkhus that it is the degree to which they have mastered faith, energy, memory, serenity and wisdom that determines their having attained the various degrees of accomplisment in his system from Faith Follower to Arahant. Then he points out that it is in this way that there is diversity in forces, diversity in fruition, diversity in powers, and diversity in peoples." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling power of faith,<br />
					the controlling power of energy,<br />
					the controlling power of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling power of concentration,<br />
					the controlling power of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the five controlling powers.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">By the completion and fulfilment, monks,<br />
					of these five controlling powers<br />
					one is Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					one obtains release midway.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he attains release by a reduction of his time.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he attains release without much trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he attains release with some trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he is 'one who goes up stream,'<br />
					one who goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he is a once-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he is a stream-winner.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he is a Norm-follower.</p>

					<p class="f4">By having them in a less degree,<br />
					he is 'one who walks by faith.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, monks, that there is a difference of controlling powers,<br />
					a difference of fruits,<br />
					a difference of individuals."</p>
