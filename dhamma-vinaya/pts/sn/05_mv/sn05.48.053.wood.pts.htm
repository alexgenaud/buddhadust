					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a><br />
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, monks,<br />
					is there any method<br />
					by proceeding according to which<br />
					a monk who is a learner,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					standing at the level of a learner,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or a monk who is an adept,<br />
					standing at the level of an adept,<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept'?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well for us<br />
					if the Exalted One would reveal the meaning<br />
					of what he has just uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, there is such a method<br />
					by proceeding according to which<br />
					a monk who is a learner,<br />
					standing at the level of a learner,<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and a monk who is an adept,<br />
					standing at the level of an adept,<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort is that method, monks?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk who is a learner<br />
					knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is <a id="pg205"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span></a> Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows full well</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice leading to the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the method<br />
					by proceeding according to which<br />
					a monk who is a learner,<br />
					standing at the level of a learner,<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, a monk who is a learner<br />
					thus ponders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there, I wonder,<br />
					outside<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> (this Order of monks)<br />
					anyone,<br />
					whether recluse or brahmin,<br />
					who can teach a doctrine<br />
					that is natural,<br />
					true<br />
					and proper,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					such as the Exalted One teaches?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he concludes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no one<br />
					outside (this Order of monks)<br />
					whether recluse or brahmin,<br />
					who can teach a doctrine<br />
					that is natural,<br />
					true<br />
					and proper,<br />
					such as the Exalted One teaches.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the method<br />
					by proceeding according to which<br />
					a monk who is a learner,<br />
					standing at the level of a learner,<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br />
					the monk who is a learner<br />
					is fully aware of the five controlling faculties:</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to what is their destiny,<br />
					what their excellence,<br />
					what their fruits<br />
					and final goal,<br />
					he dwells not in personal experience<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> thereof,<br />
					nor does he pierce through and through by insigbt<br />
					and see them plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the method<br />
					by proceeding according to which<br />
					a monk who is a learner,<br />
					standing at the level of a learner,<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a learner,'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the method<br />
					according to which the adept monk<br />
					standing at the level of an adept<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein the adept monk<br />
					fully understands the five controlling faculties:</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise as to what is their destiny,<br />
					what their excellence,<br />
					their fruits<br />
					and final goal,<br />
					he dwells in personal experience thereof:<br />
					he pierces them through and through and sees them plain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is the method by which an adept monk<br />
					standing at the level of an adept<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg206"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span></a> Then again, a monk who is an adept<br />
					fully understands the six sense-faculties,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The sense-facuity of eye,<br />
					the sense-facuity of ear,<br />
					the sense-facuity of nose,<br />
					the sense-facuity of tongue,<br />
					the sense-facuity of body<br />
					the sense-facuity of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These six sense-faculties<br />
					must come to cease without remainder,<br />
					utterly,<br />
					altogether,<br />
					in every way<br />
					and everywhere:<br />
					nor shall other six sense-faculties arise<br />
					anywhere<br />
					or anyhow.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He knows that full well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks is the method by which an adept monk<br />
					standing at the level of an adept<br />
					can be assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an adept.'</p>
