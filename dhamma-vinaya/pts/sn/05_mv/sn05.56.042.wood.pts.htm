In this sutta a bhikkhu comes across a frightening precipice and asks the Buddha if he has ever seen the like. The Buddha tells him that the precipice of old age and death, grief and lamentation, pain and misery and despair that results from own-making the own-made is a more frightening precipice than that." />

					on the hill Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk saw the great precipice<br />
