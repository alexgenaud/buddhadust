					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever clansmen have<br />
					in time past<br />
					rightly gone forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life,<br />
					who have fully comprehended what really is<br />
					all of them have fully comprehended,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the Four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen shall<br />
					in future time<br />
					rightly go forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life,<br />
					who will fully comprehend what really is<br />
					all of them will do so<br />
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen<br />
					do now<br />
					rightly go forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life,<br />
					who fully comprehend what really is<br />
					all of them do so<br />
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Ariyan truth of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the arising of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the ceasing of ill,<br />
					the Ariyan truth of the practice<br />
					that leads to the ceasing of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatsoever clansmen have<br />
					in time past<br />
					rightly gone forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life,<br />
					who have fully comprehended what really is<br />
					all of them have fully comprehended,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the Four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen shall<br />
					in future time<br />
					rightly go forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life,<br />
					who will fully comprehend what really is<br />
					all of them will do so<br />
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths,<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatsoever clansmen<br />
					do now<br />
					rightly go forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life,<br />
					who fully comprehend what really is<br />
					all of them do so<br />
					to get full comprehension of the four Ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, an effort must be made to realize:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ceasing of ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice that leads to the ceasing of ill.'"</p>
