					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					the controlling faculty of insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five controlling faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the act of cultivating and making much<br />
					of these five controlling faculties,<br />
					seven fruits,<br />
					seven advantages<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> are to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>1.</b> In this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					one establishes realization.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>2.</b> If not in this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<br />
					at any rate one does so at the moment of death.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>3.</b> If not in this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<br />
					or at the moment of death,<br />
					at any rate, by wearing down the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower world,<br />
					he is one who wins release midway.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>4.</b> If not in this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<br />
					or at the moment of death,<br />
					or by wearing down the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower world,<br />
					winning release midway,<br />
					yet by reduction of his time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					one wins release.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>5.</b> If not in this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<br />
					or at the moment of death,<br />
					or by wearing down the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower world,<br />
					winning release midway,<br />
					or by reduction of his time<br />
					winning release,<br />
					he wins release without much trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>6.</b> If not in this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<br />
					or at the moment of death,<br />
					or by wearing down the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower world,<br />
					winning release midway,<br />
					or by reduction of his time<br />
					winning release,<br />
					or by winning release without much trouble<br />
					he wins release with some trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>7.</b> If not in this very life,<br />
					beforehand,<br />
					or at the moment of death,<br />
					or by wearing down the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower world,<br />
					winning release midway,<br />
					or by reduction of his time<br />
					winning release,<br />
					or by winning release without much trouble<br />
					or by winning release with some trouble<br />
					still by having worn down the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower world,<br />
					he is 'one who goes up stream'<br />
					and he goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is by the act of cultivating<br />
					and making much of<br />
					these five controlling faculties<br />
					that these seven fruits,<br />
					these seven advantages<br />
					are to be looked for.</p>
