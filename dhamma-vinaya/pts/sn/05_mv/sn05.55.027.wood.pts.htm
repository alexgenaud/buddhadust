					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika was sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika called to a certain man, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, good fellow!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you to the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					worship in my name<br />
					with your head at the feet of the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It were well, sir,<br />
					if the venerable Ānanda would come to the house of the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, master,"<br />
					replied that man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he went to see the venerable Ānanda<br />
					on coming to him greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sir, the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					suffering from a sore disease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It were well, sir,<br />
					if the venerable Ānanda would come to the house of the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					robing himself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					set off for the dwelling of the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having sat down<br />
					he said this to the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you bearing up?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you enduring?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate<br />
					and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there any sign of their abating<br />
					and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No. sir, I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">Housefather, terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter, -<br />
					these come upon the uneducated manyfolk<br />
					who have four qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, the uneducated manyfolk have disloyalty to the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they bethink them of their disloyalty to the Buddha,<br />
					terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter,<br />
					come upon them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefather, the uneducated manyfolk have disloyalty to the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they bethink them of their disloyalty to the Norm,<br />
					terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter,<br />
					come upon them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefather, the uneducated manyfolk have disloyalty to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they bethink them of their disloyalty to the Order,<br />
					terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter,<br />
					come upon them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefather, the uneducated manyfolk have immorality.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they bethink them of their immorality<br />
					terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter,<br />
					come upon them.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, housefather, are the four things,<br />
					possessed of which,<br />
					terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter,<br />
					come upon the uneducated manyfolk.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, housefather, the educated Ariyan disciple,<br />
					possessing four qualities,<br />
					has no such terror and trembling<br />
					and fear of death,<br />
					as to what may be hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, the educated Ariyan disciple is blessed <br />

							<p>(1) <i>pāṇa-tipātā veramaṇī,</i> abstention from injuring breathing things (burning (? exhausting) breathers);<br />
							(2) <i>adinn'ādānā veramaṇī</i> abstention from taking what is not given;<br />
							(3) <i>abrahmacariyā veramaṇī</i> abstention from carrying on in an ungodly way (forgetting ethical standards in the pursuit of pleasure; often translated abstention from adultery, but this is too narrow. Where sexual transgressions are described in detail the idea is abstention from sexual intercourse in cases where the result would be dangerous to the self or harmful to another: with another man's wife or mate, with those still living with their parents, with those protected by the state or powerful individuals;<br />
							(4) musā-vādā veramaṇī abstention from intentionally saying untrue things; the idea of <i>'musā'</i> is that which is said carelessly, not only lies;<br />
							(5) <i>surā-meraya-majjapamāda-ṭṭhānā veramaṇī</i> abstaining from careless behavior resulting from fermented or distilled drinks. This is alcohol. For us, with our pelethora of intoxicants, the general rule would be where the use of a substance causes careless behavior or neglegance. This 'rule' was a later addition to the first four, and we can see in the case of SN and other similar cases, that the emphasis is on the consequence in neglegance, not the consumption of the substance.</p>
