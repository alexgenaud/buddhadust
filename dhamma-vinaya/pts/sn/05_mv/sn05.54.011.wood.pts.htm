					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I wish to live in solitude for three months. Let no one visit me save the single one who brings my food.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, lord,' replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One save the single one who brought his food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One, leaving his solitary dwelling, came and addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if the wanderers who hold other views should thus question you:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, in what way of life does Gotama the recluse generally spend the rainy season?"</p>

					<p class="f4">thus questioned,<br />
					thus should ye make reply to those wanderers holding other views:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the Exalted One generally spends his time during the rainy season in the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, monks, in this method I mindfully breathe in and mindfully breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I draw along breath I know:<br />
					A long breath I draw in.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I breathe out a long breath I know:<br />
					A long breath I breathe out...</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(as at § 1)</i> ... "contemplating renunciation I breathe out."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ariyan way of life,<br />
					best of<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span> ways,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

					<p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br />
					the best of ways,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life."</p>

					<p class="f4">As for those monks who are learners,<br />
					who have not won their goal,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who dwell aspiring for tile unsurpassed security from bondage,<br />
					— for such the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					conduces to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, for those monks who are Arahants,<br />
					in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br />
					who have lived the life,<br />
					done the task,<br />
					lifted the burden,<br />

					worn out the fetters of becoming,<br />
					who by perfect knowledge have become free,<br />
					— for such also the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					conduces both to pleasant living<br />
					and to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> mindful composure even in this very life.</p>
