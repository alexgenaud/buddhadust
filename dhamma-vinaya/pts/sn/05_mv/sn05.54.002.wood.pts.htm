					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, concentration on in-breathing and our-breathing,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					is of great fruit,<br />
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">How cultivated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Under this rule,<br />
					a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness<br />
					accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is Norm-investigation,<br />
					accompanied by concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is equanimity,<br />
					which tends to seclusion,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					that ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">If thus cultivated and made much of, monks,<br />
					the concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					is of great fruit,<br />
					of great profit."</p>
