					<p class="f4">Now Mahānāma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span> the Sakyan came to see the venerable Lomasavangīsa,and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated Mahānāma the Sakyan said this to the venerable Lomasavangīsa:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, is a learner's way of life the same as that of a Tathāgata,<br />
					or are the two different?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No indeed, friend Mahānāma,<br />
					a learner's way of life is not that of a Tathāgata.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The two are different.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg291"><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></a> Those monks, friend Mahānāma, who are learners,<br />
					who have not won their goal,<br />
					who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage,<br />
					— such dwell having abandoned five hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The hindrances which are sensual desire,<br />
					resentment,<br />
					sloth and torpor,<br />
					excitement and worry,<br />
					doubt and wavering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those monks, friend, who are learners,<br />
					who have not won their goal,<br />
					who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from bondage,<br />
					— such have abandoned these hindrances.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, friend Mahānāma,<br />
					those monks who are Arahants,<br />
					in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br />
					who have lived the life,<br />
					done the task,<br />
					lifted the burden,<br />
					won their highest good,<br />
					worn out the fetters of becoming,<br />
					who by perfect knowledge have become free,<br />
					— in such these five hindrances are not only abandoned,<br />
					but cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made something that has ceased to be,<br />
					so as not to grow again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The hindrances which are sensual desire,<br />
					resentment,<br />
					sloth and torpor,<br />
					excitement and flurry,<br />
					doubt and wavering,<br />
					are in them abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made something that has ceased to be,<br />
					so as not to grow again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, friend Mahānāma,<br />
					you are to understand that the learner's way of life is one thing,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life another thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on a certain occasion, friend Mahānāma,<br />
					the Exalted One was staying at Icchānangala<br />
					in a jungle thicket of Icchānangala.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I wish to live in solitude for three months.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let no one visit me save the single one who brings my food.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, lord,' replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus no one visited the Exalted One save the single one who brought his food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at the end of those three months the Exalted One,<br />
					leaving his solitary dwelling,<br />
					came and addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if the wanderers who hold other views should thus question you:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, in what way of life does Gotama the recluse generally spend the rainy season?"</p>

					<p class="f4">thus questioned,<br />
					thus should ye make reply to those wanderers holding other views:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the Exalted One generally spends his time during the rainy season<br />
					in the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, monks, in this method<br />
					I mindfully breathe in<br />
					and mindfully breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I draw along breath I know:<br />
					A long breath I draw in.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I breathe out a long breath I know:<br />
					A long breath I breathe out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I shall breathe in,<br />
					feeling it go through the whole body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Feeling it go through the whole body<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Calming down the bodily aggregate<br />
					I shall breathe out."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Feeling the thrill of zest<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Feeling the thrill of zest<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Feeling the sense of ease<br />
					I shall breathe out."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Aware of all mental factors<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Aware of all mental factors<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br />
					I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Calming down the mental factors<br />
					I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Aware of mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Gladdening my mind I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gladdening my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Composing my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Detaching my mind I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I make up my mind (repeating):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Contemplating impermanence I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Contemplating dispassion I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Contemplating cessation I shall breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Contemplating renunciation I shall breathe out.</p>					

					<p class="f4">"Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ariyan way of life,<br />
					best of ways,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

					<p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br />
					the best of ways,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life."</p>

					<p class="f4">As for those monks who are learners,<br />
					who have not won their goal,<br />
					who dwell aspiring for tile unsurpassed security from bondage,<br />
					— for such the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					conduces to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, for those monks who are Arahants,<br />
					in whom the āsavas are destroyed,<br />
					who have lived the life,<br />
					done the task,<br />
					lifted the burden,<br />
					won their highest good,<br />
					worn out the fetters of becoming,<br />
					who by perfect knowledge have become free,<br />
					— for such also the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing,<br />
					if cultivated and made much of,<br />
					conduces both to pleasant living<br />
					and to mindful composure even in this very life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, he who would rightly use the words</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ariyan way,<br />
					best of ways,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life"</p>

					<p class="f4">would rightly do so in calling by this name the intent concentration on in-breathing and out-breathing, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Ariyan way of life,<br />
					the best way of life,<br />
					the Tathāgata's way of life."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So by this method, friend Mahānāma, you are to understand that the learner's way of life is one thing,<br />
					that of the Tathāgata another thing.'</p>
