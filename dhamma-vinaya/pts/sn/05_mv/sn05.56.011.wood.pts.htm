					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Benares, at Isipatana, in the Deer-Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One thus spake unto the company of five monks:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these two extremes should not be followed<br />
					by one who has gone forth as a wanderer.<br />
					What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Devotion to the pleasures of sense,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a low practice of <span class="f3"><b>[357]</b></span> villagers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a practice unworthy, unprofitable,<br />
					the way of the world<br />
					(on the one hand);<br />
					and (on the other)<br />
					devotion to self-mortification,<br />
					which is painful,<br />
					unworthy<br />
					and unprofitable.</p>

					<p class="f4">By avoiding these two extremes<br />
					the Tathāgata has gained knowledge of that middle path<br />
					which giveth vision,<br />
					which giveth knowledge,<br />
					which causeth calm,<br />
					special knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					enlightenment,<br />
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is that middle path<br />
					which giveth vision,<br />
					which giveth knowledge,<br />
					which causeth calm,<br />
					special knowledge,<br />
					enlightenment,<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily it is this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br />
					right aim,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right living,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is that middle path<br />
					which giveth vision,<br />
					which giveth knowledge,<br />
					which causeth calm,<br />
					special knowledge,<br />
					enlightenment,<br />
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the Ariyan truth about Ill:</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is Ill,<br />
					decay is Ill,<br />
					sickness is Ill,<br />
					death is Ill:<br />
					likewise sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">To be conjoined with things which we dislike:<br />
					to be separated from things which we like,<br />
					— that also is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not to get what one wants,<br />
					— that also is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a word,<br />
					this body,<br />
					this fivefold mass which is based on grasping,<br />
					— that is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks, is the Ariyan truth<br />
					about the arising of Ill:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that craving that leads back to birth,<br />
					along with the lure and the lust<br />
					that lingers longingly now here, now there: namely,<br />
					the craving for sensual pleasure,<br />
					the craving to be born again,<br />
					the craving for existence to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the Ariyan truth<br />
					about the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this, monks,<br />
					is the <span class="f3"><b>[422]</b></span> Ariyan truth<br />
					about the ceasing of Ill:</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily it is the utter passionless cessation of,<br />
					the giving up,<br />
					the forsaking,<br />
					the release from,<br />
					the absence of longing<br />
					for this craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, monks,<br />
					is the Ariyan truth<br />
					about the practice<br />
					that leads to the ceasing of Ill:</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily it is this Ariyan eightfold way, to wit:<br />
					Right view,<br />
					right aim,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right living,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, at the thought<br />
					of this Ariyan truth of Ill,<br />
					— concerning things unlearnt before,<br />
					there arose in me vision,<br />
					insight,<br />
					understanding:<br />
					there arose in me wisdom,<br />
					there arose in me light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, at the thought:<br />
					This Ariyan truth about Ill<br />
					is to be understood,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, at the thought:<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, at the thought<br />
					of this Ariyan truth<br />
					about the arising of Ill,<br />
					— concerning things unlearnt before,<br />
					there arose in me vision,<br />
					insight,<br />
					understanding:<br />

					<p class="f4">At the thought:<br />
					This arising of Ill<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is to be put away,<br />

					<p class="f4">At the thought:<br />

					<p class="f4">At the thought:<br />
					This ceasing of Ill<br />
					must be realized,<br />
					— concerning things unlearnt before,<br />

					there arose in me light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, at the thought<br />
					of this Ariyan truth<br />
					about the <b>[359]</b> practice<br />
					leading to the ceasing of Ill,<br />
					— concerning things unlearnt before,<br />
					there arose in me vision,<br />
					insight,<br />
					understanding:<br />
					there arose in me wisdom,<br />
					there arose in me light.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:<br />
					This Ariyan truth<br />
					about the practice<br />
					leading to the ceasing of Ill<br />
					must be cultivated,<br />
					— concerning things unlearnt before,<br />
					there arose in me vision,<br />
					insight,<br />
					understanding:<br />

					<p class="f4">At the thought:<br />

					insight,<br />
					understanding:<br />
					there arose in me wisdom,<br />
					there arose in me light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, so long as my knowledge and insight<br />
					of these thrice revolved twelvefold Ariyan truths,<br />
					in their essential nature,<br />
					was not quite purified,<br />
					— so long was I not sure<br />
					that in this world,<br />
					together with its Devas,<br />
					its Māras,<br />
					its Brahmās,<br />
					among the hosts of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					of Devas and mankind,<br />
					there was one enlightened<br />
					with supreme enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, so soon as my knowledge and insight<br />
					of these thrice revolved twelvefold Ariyan truths,<br />
					in their essential nature,<br />
					was quite purified,<br />
					— then, monks, was I assured<br />
					what it is to be enlightened<br />
					with supreme enlightenment<br />
					with regard to the world and its Devas,<br />
					its Māras,<br />
					its Brahmās,<br />
					and with regard to the hosts<br />
					of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					of Devas and mankind.<br />
					Now knowledge and insight<br />
					have arisen in me<br />
					so that I know:<br />
					Sure is my heart's release.<br />
					This is my last birth.<br />
					There is no more becoming for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and the company of five monks<br />
					were glad and rejoiced at the words<br />
					of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when this sermon had been spoken,<br />
					there arose in the venerable Kondañña<br />
					the pure and stainless eye<br />
					to see the Norm, to wit:<br />
					Whatsoever is of a nature to arise<br />
					is likewise of a nature to cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, when the foundation of the kingdom of the Norm<br />
					had been thus established by the Exalted One,<br />
					the Devas of the earth raised the cry:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At Benares, at Isipatana,<br />
					in the Deer-Park,<br />
					hath been established by the Exalted One<br />
					this kingdom of the Norm unsurpassed,<br />
					this kingdom not to be overset<br />
					by any recluse or brahmin,<br />
					any Deva or Māra<br />
					or Brahmā,<br />
					or by anyone whatsoever in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Devas of the Four Kings heard the cry<br />
					of the Devas of the earth,<br />
					they also raised the cry:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At Benares, at Isipatana,<br />
					in the Deer-Park,<br />
					hath been established by the Exalted One<br />
					this kingdom of the Norm unsurpassed,<br />
					this kingdom not to be overset<br />
					by any recluse or brahmin,<br />
					any Deva or Māra<br />
					or Brahmā,<br />
					or by anyone whatsoever in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br />
					the Yama Devas,<br />
					the Devas of Delight,<br />
					the Creative Devas,<br />
					the Devas who rejoice in the works of other Devas,<br />
					and the Devas of the company of Brahmā,<br />
					heard the cry of the Devas of the Four Kings,<br />
					they also raised the cry:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At Benares, at Isipatana,<br />
					in the Deer-Park,<br />
					hath been established by the Exalted One<br />
					this kingdom of the Norm <span class="f3"><b>[424]</b></span> unsurpassed,<br />
					this kingdom not to be overset<br />
					by any recluse or brahmin,<br />
					any Deva or Māra<br />
					or Brahmā,<br />
					or by anyone whatsoever in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus at that very hour,<br />
					at that very moment,<br />
					in an instant of time<br />
					the cry reached even to the Brahma World,<br />
					and this thousandfold world-system quaked<br />
					and quaked again:<br />
					it was shaken to and fro,<br />
					and an immeasurable mighty radiance shone forth,<br />
					surpassing even the magic power of the Devas.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Thereupon the Exalted One uttered this solemn saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Kondañña indeed has understood!<br />
					Kondañña indeed has understood! '</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it was that the venerable Kondañña won his name of 'Kondañña-who-hath-understood<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
