					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, monks, in a peaked house<br />
					all rafters whatsoever<br />
					go together to the peak,<br />
					slope to the peak,<br />
					join in the peak,<br />
					and of them all<br />
					the peak is reckoned chief,<br />
					even so, monks, the monk<br />
					who cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					slopes to Nibbāna,<br />
					inclines to Nibbāna,<br />
					tends to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk<br />
					who cultivates and makes much of<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom<br />
					slope to Nibbāna,<br />
					incline to Nibbāna,<br />
					tend to Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is mindfulness,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is investigation of the Norm,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is energy,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is zest,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is tranquillity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is concentration,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cultivates the limb of wisdom<br />
					that is equanimity,<br />
					which is based on seclusion,<br />
					on dispassion,<br />
					on cessation,<br />
					which ends in self-surrender.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated, Kuṇḍaliya<br />
					thus made much of,<br />
					do the seven limbs of wisdom<br />
					complete the release by knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus cultivated and made much of, monks,<br />
					the seven limbs of wisdom<br />
					slope to Nibbāna,<br />
					incline to Nibbāna,<br />
