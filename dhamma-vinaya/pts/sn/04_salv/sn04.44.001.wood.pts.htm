					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the sister Khemā,<br />
					after going her rounds among the Kosalans,<br />
					took up her quarters at Toraṇavatthu,<br />
					between Sāvatthī and Sāketa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the rājah Pasenadi of Kosala was journeying from Sāketa to Sāvatthī,<br />
					and midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthī<br />
					he put up for one night at Toraṇavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rājah Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, good fellow!<br />
					Find out some recluse or brahmin<br />
					such that I can wait upon<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> him to-day."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, your majesty,"<br />
					said that man in reply to the rājah Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					and after wandering through all Toraṇavatthu<br />
					he saw not anyone,<br />
					either recluse or brahmin,<br />
					on whom the rājah Pasenadi might wait.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that man saw the sister Khemā,<br />
					who had come <a id="pg266"><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></a> to reside at Toraṇavatthu.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on seeing her<br />
					he went back to the rājah Pasenadi of Kosala, and said: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your majesty, there is no recluse or brahmin in Toranavattthu<br />
					such that your majesty can wait upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">But your majesty,<br />
					there is a sister named Khemā,<br />
					a woman disciple of that Exalted One,<br />
					who is Arahant,<br />
					an All-enlightened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of this lady a lovely rumor has gone abroad,<br />
					that she is sage,<br />
					accomplished,<br />
					shrewd,<br />
					widely learned,<br />
					a brilliant talker,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Let your majesty wait upon her."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the rājah Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					went to visit the sister Khemā,<br />
					and on coming to her<br />
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said to her: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"How say you, lady?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does the Tathāgata exist after death?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

In this last birth she was wife of the rājah Bimbisāra, and of great beauty. Pride in this was destroyed in her by the Master, who conjured up a vision of beauty decaying. She was convinced, entered the Order, and ultimately became Arahant. She was ranked first in insight by the Master (as <i>mahāpaññā</i>) in the list of 'great ones' at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/01_ones/an01.188-295.pali.bd.htm#p236"><i>A.</i> i, 25;</a> <i>AA.</i> i. 342. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.rhyc.pts.htm#pg160"><i>K.S.</i> ii, 160.</a></p>

							Our <i>Comy.,</i> however, reads here <i>vibhāyissati</i> (with comment <i>na viruddhaṅ saddaṅ bhavissati</i>). I would read <i>viggahissati</i> (non separabitur) in both texts. The meaning in any case is "there will be found no discrepancy."</p>
