					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#koliya">Koliyans</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at Uttara,<br />
					a township of the Koliyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pāṭaliya, the headman, came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Pāṭaliya, the headman,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard it said, lord,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse knows magic.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Those who thus aver, lord,<br />
					that Gotama the recluse knows magic, -<br />
					do they speak in accordance with the Exalted One's view,<br />
					without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br />
					by stating what is wrong?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they speak in conformity with his teaching,<br />
					so that no one who is of the same view,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a follower of his view,<br />
					could give opportunity for censure?</p>

					<p class="f4">We wish not to speak falsely of the Exalted One, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"They who said thus, headman,<br />
					that I know magic,<br />
					do speak in accordance with my view.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not misrepresent me<br />
					by stating what is wrong.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do speak in conformity with my teaching,<br />
					so that no one who is of the same view as I,<br />
					who is a follower of my view,<br />
					could give opportunity for censure."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"So then it is true, my friend,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					though I did not believe those recluses and brahmins<br />
					when they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse knows magic.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So after all,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> my friend, Gotama the recluse<br />
					is a trickster."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, headman, does he who says that I know magic, -<br />
					<a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> does he in so saying<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, headman, in this matter<br />

					<p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">1.</h4>

					<p class="f4 ctr">(i)</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you know the hirelings of the Koliyans,<br />
					who have drooping crests?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, I do know them."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">For what purpose<br />
					are these hirelings of the Koliyans,<br />
					who have drooping crests?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"To check robbers, lord,<br />
					among the Koliyans<br />
					and to carry messages for the Koliyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, lord, is the reason<br />
					for those hirelings of the Koliyans,<br />
					who have drooping crests."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those hirelings of the Koliyans,<br />
					do you know them as honest<br />
					or as rogues?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know them, lord, as wicked rogues.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there be any wicked rogues<br />
					among the Koliyans,<br />
					it is they."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, headman, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pāṭaliya, the headman,<br />
					knows that the hirelings of the Koliyans,<br />
					who have drooping crests,<br />
					are wicked rogues.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore Pataliya, the headman,<br />
					is himself a wicked rogue,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">would he be speaking truth in so saying?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The hirelings of the Koliyans<br />
					are one thing,<br />
					but I am quite another thing,<br />
					of quite another nature<br />
					from that of the Koliyans' hirelings<br />
					who have drooping crests,<br />
					of quite another nature!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, headman, you will get<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> this said about you:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 mart6">
							<p>Woodward remarks in footnote <a href="#n20">#20</a> that this passage is garbled. It is definately so, but in a different sense than is intended by Woodward, as the manner of making the argument is flawed. (Not likely in the original. See how this argument is made in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.060.horn.pts.htm#fn5">MN 60</a>) The first premise, that if the first teacher's argument is true must be followed by the statement that if this teacher's argument is not true, ... then; that is: 1. in the case of the teacher of the negative argument: if the teacher's statement is true, it makes no difference in terms of kamma or the after-life, but here and now he enjoys the serenity of a good man; and if it is not true he enjoys the serenity of a good man and has secured rebirth in a heavenly state as well. 2. In the case of the teachers of the positive view if the teacher's statement is true: he gets the benefits of behaving in an ethical way and enjoys the serenity of a good man; and if it is not true it makes no difference in terms of kamma or the after-life, but he has secured the serenity of a good man in the here and now.   As made here 'accepted' premises are not adhered to which is not <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/come_beggar/cb_001.htm">'kaccha'</a>. The translation might have overcome this error by wording it: 'Whether or not this teaching is true...'</p>

							<p>Further, the abridgment confuses the organization and Woodward, aparently confused by that has omitted <i>'karuṇa'</i> (his 'compassion') in the parallel sections that follow. The organization should be (as I have re-arranged it in this version) (Woodward's terminology):<br />
							4.i. Kindliness <i>(Metta)</i> + Teacher 1, ii. Kindliness + teacher 2,  iii. Kindliness + teacher 3, iv. Kindliness + teacher 4;<br />
							5.i. Compassion <i>(Karuṇa)</i> + Teacher 1, Compassion + teacher 2,  Compassion + teacher 3, Compassion + teacher 4;<br />
							5.ii. Sympathy <i>(Mudita)</i> + Teacher 1, Sympathy + teacher 2,  Sympathy + teacher 3, Sympathy + teacher 4;<br />
							5.iii. Equanimity <i>(Upekkha)</i> + Teacher 1, Equanimity + teacher 2,  Equanimity + teacher 3, Equanimity + teacher 4.<br />
							This depends on reading the PTS Pali §5.1 as an abridgment, and results in a section-numbering change.</p>

							<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi has arranged this:<br />
							4.i. Loving-Kindness <i>(Metta)</i> + Teacher 1, ii. Loving-Kindness + teacher 2,  iii. Loving-Kindness + teacher 3, iv. Loving-Kindness + teacher 4;<br />
							5.i. Compassion + Altruistic Joy + Equanimity + teacher 1;<br />
							5.ii. Compassion + Altruistic Joy + Equanimity + teacher 2;<br />
							5.iii. Compassion + Altruistic Joy + Equanimity + teacher 3;<br />
							5.iv. Compassion + Altruistic Joy + Equanimity + teacher 4;<br />
							His reading understands §5.i to be a pattern to be followed in the following sections but is not balanced with §4.</p>

							<p>The PTS Pali text arrangement is:<br />
							4.i. <i>Metta</i> + Teacher 1, ii. <i>Metta</i> + teacher 2,  iii. <i>Metta</i> + teacher 3, iv. <i>Metta</i> + teacher 4;<br />
							5.i. <i>Karuṇa + mudita + upekkha</i> + teacher 1;<br />
							5.ii. <i>Upekkha</i> + teacher 2;<br />
							5.iii. <i>Upekkha</i> + teacher 3;<br />
							5.iv. <i>Upekkha</i> + teacher 4.</p>

							<p>I have arranged the Pali used here according to the scheme followed in my Woodward re-organization.</p>
