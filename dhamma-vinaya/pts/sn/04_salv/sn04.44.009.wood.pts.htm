This thought is called <i>cuti-citta</i> (decease thought). Hence on his death-bed a man is urged by his friends and relatives to fix his thoughts on profitable things, in order to be reborn accordantly. See the death-bed scene of Citta (supra). The <i>khīṇāsava</i> or Arahant, having no <i>upādāna</i> (fuel or grasping), has no thought attaching him to any object <i>(kiñcana),</i> so his flame flickers out for want of fuel.</p>
