<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 116. The Buddha states that the end of the world is not to be reached by finding the end of the world but also that the end of pain cannot be reached without finding the end of the world. The bhikkhus question Ānanda about this teaching in brief and Ānanda explains that the meaning is that in the Buddha's system the world is to be understood as experiencing through the senses. The Buddha confirms Ānanda's explanation." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> Woodward has 'saying', but the Buddha did not "rise up from his seat and enter his residence saying" what he said. He said what he said and then rose up...; further Woodward alters the wording of his translation slightly where the Pali is (and always is) identical. I have changed things accordingly, but have retained Woodward's vocabulary.</p>
