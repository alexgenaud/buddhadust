The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that visible objects, sounds, scents, savours, touches, and things were impermanent in the past, will be impermanent in the future and are impermanent now and that seeing that one should strive to be repelled by them, become dispassionate towards them, and look for their ending." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Objects, brethren, are impermanent,<br />
