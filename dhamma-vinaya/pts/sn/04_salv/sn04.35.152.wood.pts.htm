					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there, Brethren, any method,<br />
					by following which<br />
					a brother, apart from belief,<br />
					apart from inclination,<br />
					apart from hearsay,<br />
					apart from argument as to method,<br />
					apart from reflection on reasons,<br />
					apart from delight in speculation,<br />
					could affirm insight, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have their root in the Exalted One,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br />
					if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is indeed a method, Brethren,<br />
					by following which<br />
					a brother, apart from belief,<br />
					apart from inclination,<br />
					apart from hearsay,<br />
					apart from argument as to method,<br />
					apart from reflection on reasons,<br />
					apart from delight in speculation,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what is that method?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother,<br />
					beholding an object with the eye,<br />
					either recognizes within him the existence<br />
					of lust, malice and illusion, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have lust, malice and illusion,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or recognizes the non-existence of these qualities within him, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have not lust, malice and illusion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to that recognition<br />

					or argument as to method,<br />
					or reflection on reasons,<br />
					or delight in speculation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>
