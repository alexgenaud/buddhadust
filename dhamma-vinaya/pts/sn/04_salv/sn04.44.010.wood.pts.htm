The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks Gotama about whether or not there is a self and receives no reply. When asked by Ānanda for the reason he did not reply he explains that answering in the affirmative he would be stating the eternalists view, answering in the negative he would be stating the annihilationists view, answering in the affirmative he would be answering contrary to his knowledge of all things as changing, answering in the negative poor bewildered Vacchagotta would have been even more bewilded than before." />

					<p class="f4">Then the Wanderer, Vacchagotta, came to visit the Exalted One<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of civilities<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer, Vacchagotta,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, master Gotama, is there a self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, then, master Gotama, is there not a self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">For a second time also the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vacchagotta the Wanderer rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of Vacchagotta the Wanderer<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, lord,<br />
					that the Exalted One gave no answer<br />
					to the question of Vacchagotta the Wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> 'If, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had replied to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is a self,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then, Ānanda,<br />
					that would be siding<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the recluses and brahmins<br />
					who are eternalists.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, Ānanda, when asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there not a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I had replied that</p>

					<p class="f4">'It does not exist',</p>

					<p class="f4">that, Ānanda, would be siding<br />
					with those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who are annihilationists.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">had I replied that</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is',</p>

					<p class="f4">would my reply be in accordance with the knowledge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that</p>

					<p class="f4">'All things are not-self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, Ānanda, when asked by the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there not a self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">had I replied that</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is not',</p>

					<p class="f4">it would have been more bewilderment<br />
					for the bewildered Vacchagotta.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he would have said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Formerly indeed I had a self,<br />
					but now I have not one any more.'"</p>
