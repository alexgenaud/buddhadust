					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nalanda</a> in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					came to see <a id="pg221"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span></a> the Exalted One and,<br />
					on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does not the Exalted One, lord,<br />
					dwell in compassion for every living thing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, headman, the Tathāgata,<br />
					dwells in compassion for every living thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, does the Exalted One<br />
					teach the Norm in full<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to certain ones,<br />
					but to certain others<br />
					he does not teach the Norm in full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, headman, as to this<br />
					I shall question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you reply as you think fit.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a yeoman farmer<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> here<br />
					has three fields,<br />
					one excellent,<br />
					one moderate,<br />
					and one poor,<br />
					hard,<br />
					saltish,<br />
					of bad soil</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">When that yeoman farmer wants to sow his seed,<br />
					which field would he sow first,<br />
					the excellent field,<br />
					the moderate field,<br />
					or the one that is poor,<br />
					hard,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saltish,<br />
					of bad soil?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"That yeoman farmer, lord,<br />
					wishing to sow his seed,<br />
					would first sow the excellent field,<br />
					and having done so<br />
					he would sow the moderate one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having so done<br />
					he might and might not sow that field<br />
					that is poor,<br />
					hard,<br />
					saltish,<br />
					of bad soil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in any case<br />
					it might do for cattle-food."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, headman, just like that excellent field<br />
					are my ordained disciples,<br />
					both men and women.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br />
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br />
					lovely in its middle<br />
					and lovely in its ending,<br />
					both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known to them<br />
					the righteous life<br />
					that is wholly perfect<br />
					and utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, headman,<br />
					these people abide with me for their island,<br />
					with me for their cave of shelter,<br />
					me for their stronghold,<br />
					me for their refuge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, headman,<br />
					just like that moderate field<br />
					are my lay-disciples,<br />
					both men and women.</p>

					<p class="f4">I teach them the Norm<br />
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br />
					lovely in its middle<br />
					and lovely in its ending,<br />
					both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known <a id="pg222"><span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span></a> to them<br />
					the righteous life<br />
					that is wholly perfect<br />
					and utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, headman,<br />
					these people abide with me for their island,<br />
					with me for their cave of shelter,<br />
					me for their stronghold,<br />
					me for their refuge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, headman,<br />
					just like that field that is poor,<br />
					hard,<br />
					saltish,<br />
					of bad soil,<br />
					are my<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> wandering recluses and brahmins<br />
					that hold other views than mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">To them also I teach the Norm<br />
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br />
					lovely in its middle<br />
					and lovely in its ending,<br />
					both in spirit and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I make known to them<br />
					the righteous life<br />
					that is wholly perfect<br />
					and utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because if so be they understand<br />
					but a single sentence of it,<br />
					that would be to their profit and happiness<br />
					for many a long day.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, headman,<br />
					suppose a man has three waterpots,<br />
					one not cracked,<br />
					not leaky,<br />
					not letting (water) run to waste -<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and one waterpot not cracked,<br />
					but leaky<br />
					and letting water run to waste:<br />
					and one waterpot that is both cracked and leaky,<br />
					and letting water run to waste.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">If that man wants to store up water,<br />
					which pöt would he put it in first, -<br />
					in the one that is not cracked,<br />
					not leaky,<br />
					not letting water run to waste?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would he put it in the pot<br />
					that is not cracked,<br />
					but leaky,<br />
					letting water run to waste?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would he put it in the one<br />
					that is both cracked and leaky,<br />
					and letting water run to waste?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, that man would first store his water -<br />
					in the one that is not cracked,<br />
					not leaky,<br />
					not letting water run to waste,<br />
					then in the pot<br />
					that is not cracked,<br />
					but leaky,<br />
					letting water run to waste, and as to the one<br />
					that is both cracked and leaky,<br />
					and letting water run to waste<br />
					he might or he might not put it in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">At any rate the water<br />
					might do for washing pots."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brahmin, just like that waterpot<br />

					<p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son<br />

					<p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />

					or point out the way<br />

					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br />
