<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 87. Sāriputta and Maha Cunda visit Channa who is dying a painful death. Channa announces he will 'take the knife' (commit suicide). Sāriputta questions him as to his understanding of Dhamma and Maha Cunda recites for him a saying of the Buddha warning against the wavering that results from attachments. Later, after Channa has 'taken the knife' Sāriputta questions the Buddha as to Channa's fate. The Buddha states that his was a blameless end." />

					<p class="f4"> Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in Bamboo Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/maha_cunda.htm">Cunda, the Great</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and the venerable Channa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> were staying on Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the venerable Channa was sick, afflicted, stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta, at eventide rising from his solitude, went to visit the venerable Cunda, and on coming to him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, friend Cunda, to visit the venerable Channa and ask about his sickness."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Cunda the Great assented, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">So they two went to visit the venerable Channa, and on reaching him sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">On sitting down the venerable Sāriputta said to the venerable Channa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating, but of their increasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, friend, a strong man<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> with a sharp-pointed sword were crashing into my brain, just so, friend, does the strong rush of vital air torment my brain.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, friend, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, friend, a skilful butcher or butcher's 'prentice with a sharp butcher's knife were ripping up my belly, even <a id="pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a> so strong, friend, are the winds that rack my belly.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, friend, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, friend, two strong men should lay hold of some weaker man, seizing him each by an arm, and should scorch and burn him in a pit of glowing charcoal, even so scorching, friend, is the burning in my body.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, friend, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating, but of their increasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'll use the knife,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">I wish to live no longer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let not the venerable Channa use the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the venerable Channa bear up.</p>

					<p class="f4">We want the venerable Channa to bear up.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the venerable Channa has no proper medicine, I will search for proper medicine for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he has no fit attendants, I will wait on the venerable Channa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let not the venerable Channa use the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him bear up.</p>

					<p class="f4">We want the venerable Channa to bear up."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not without proper food.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not without proper medicine.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not without fit attendants.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, friend, waited on the Master for many a long day with service that was delightful, not tedious.</p>

							<p>This passage is rendered more clearly by Bhk. Bodhi where the meaning is that Sāriputta is questioning the outcome of Channa's suicide because he was intimate with many householders.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> remarks that Sāriputta was aware, in spite of this reply, of the fact that Channa was still unperfected, but made no remark thereon, while Cunda, with the intention of testing him, gave him this sermon.</p>

The facts could not have been known, and it seems a rather desperate effort to work up a satisfactory reason for this supposed attainment. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Comy.</i> on v. 381 of <i>Dhammapada,</i> the case of Vakkhali.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward alters his translation here to: "... things cognizable by eye-consciousness that is in the eye, -" but the Pali text is the same as above. I am altering his translation to conform to the repetition found in the Pali.</p>
