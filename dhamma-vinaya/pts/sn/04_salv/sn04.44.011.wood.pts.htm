<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 11. The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks the Venerable Sabhiya a series of questions about existence and non-existence of one who has attained the goal and is told in all cases that these are not questions on which the Buddha has made a declarative statement. When asked why this is so, the Venerable Sabhiya asks in return how one would describe someone if there were no grounds for saying that a thing existed." />

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sabhiya of the Kaccanas<br />
					was staying at Ñātika in the Brick Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Wanderer Vacchagotta went to visit the venerable Sabhiya,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him in friendly fashion,<br />
					and after the exchange of civilities,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Wanderer Vacchagotta said to the venerable Sabhiya: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"How say you, master Kaccana?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Does the Tathāgata, exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Does the Tathāgata, neither exist nor not-exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, Vaccha, is not revealed by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, master Kaccana, what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why Gotama the recluse,<br />
					when questioned thus,<br />
					does not answer that:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, exists after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, does not exist after death?'</p>

					<p class="f4">or:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata, both exists and does not exist after death'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now as to the reason,<br />
					the grounds,<br />
					for describing him as 'embodied'<br />

					as 'conscious'<br />
					or 'unconscious',<br />
					as 'neither conscious nor unconscious', -<br />
					if such reason,<br />
					such grounds,<br />
					should cease in every way,<br />

					wholly,<br />
					utterly<br />
					and without remainder,<br />
					by what definition<br />

					as 'neither conscious nor unconscious?'"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"How long have you been ordained, Kaccana?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not long, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only three years."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is indeed a great thing, friend,<br />
