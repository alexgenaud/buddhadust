					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/maha_kaccana.htm">Kaccana the Great</a> was staying among the folk of <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#avanti">Avanti,</a> at Makkarakaṭa in a forest hut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of resident pupils of the brahmin Lohicca,<br />
					mere lads who were gathering sticks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					came up to the forest hut<br />
					of the venerable Kaccana the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching it<br />
					they began to roam and wander up and down<br />
					on all sides of the hut,<br />
					uproarious and noisy,<br />
					playing all sorts of mad pranks.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These shavelings,<br />
					sham recluses,<br />
					menials,<br />
					black fellows,<br />
					the offspring of our kinsman's foot,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are honoured,<br />
					revered,<br />
					made much of,<br />
					worshipped,<br />
					and given offerings<br />
					by these sons of coolies."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Kaccana the Great<br />
					came out of his dwelling<br />
					and thus addressed those lads:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hush! my lads.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Norm."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					the young fellows were silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Kaccana the Great<br />
					addressed them with these verses: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Foremost in virtue were the men of old,<br />
							Those brahmins who remembered ancient rules.<br />
							In them well guarded were the doors of sense.<br />
							They had achieved the mastery of wrath.<br />
							In meditation and the Norm they took delight,<br />
							Those brahmins who remembered ancient rules.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">But these backsliders<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> with their 'Let us recite,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

							Vain is the penance of the uncontrolled,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Empty as treasure gotten in a dream.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> Such, ways<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> as fastings, couching on the ground,<br />
							Bathing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> at dawn, recitings of the Three,<br />
							Wearing rough hides, and matted hair and filth,<br />
							Chantings and empty rites and penances,<br />
							Hypocrisy and cheating and the rod,<br />

							These are the caste-marks<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> of the brahmin folk,<br />
							Things done and practised for some trifling gain.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A heart well tamed, made pure and undefiled,<br />
							Considerate<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> for every living thing, -<br />
							That is the Way the highest to attain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the young fellows were angered and displeased,<br />
					and went away to the brahmin Lohicca.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him they said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"May it please your reverence to know<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that the recluse, Kaccana the Great, is attacking and abusing<br />
					the sacred things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> of the brahmins."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the brahmin Lohicca was angered and displeased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahmin Lohicca:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not proper for me<br />
					to attack and abuse the recluse, Kaccana the Great,<br />
					merely on hearsay of young fellows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I visit and question him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So the brahmin Lohicca went along with those young fellows<br />
					to visit the venerable Kaccana the Great,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously<br />
					and, after the exchange <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> of greetings and compliments,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he said to the venerable Kaccana the Great: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Worthy Kaccana, is it true<br />
					that a number of our resident pupils,<br />
					mere lads, gathering sticks,<br />
					have been here?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is true, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">They did come here."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And did the worthy Kaccana<br />
					have any converse with those lads?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I did, brahmin."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray what was the topic of the converse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I spoke to them to this effect, brahmin: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Foremost in virtue were the men of old,<br />
							Those brahmins who remembered ancient rules.<br />
							In them well guarded were the doors of sense.<br />
							They had achieved the mastery of wrath.<br />
							In meditation and the Norm they took delight,<br />
							Those brahmins who remembered ancient rules.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">But these backsliders with their 'Let us recite,'<br />
							Drunk with the pride of birth, walk wrongfully.<br />
							O'ercome by wrath, exceeding violent,<br />
							They come to loss 'mongst weak and strong alike.<br />
							Vain is the penance of the uncontrolled,<br />
							Empty as treasure gotten in a dream.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Such, ways as fastings, couching on the ground,<br />
							Bathing at dawn, recitings of the Three,<br />
							Wearing rough hides, and matted hair and filth,<br />
							Chantings and empty rites and penances,<br />
							Hypocrisy and cheating and the rod,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, brahmin, was the talk Ihad with the young fellows."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You said 'unguarded in the doors of sense,' worthy Kaccana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now how far is one unguarded in the doors of sense?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to the words<br />
