					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother went to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					that brother said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, as I was meditating alone<br />
					this reflection arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Three feelings have been spoken of by the Exalted One:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling<br />
					and neutral feeling:<br />
					these three.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One has said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br />
					that is joined with ill."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, concerning what was this saying uttered:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever is experienced,<br />
					that is joined with ill'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">These three feelings were named by me,<br />
					and I said also,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br />
					that is joined with ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brother, this saying of mine<br />
					was uttered concerning<br />
					the impermanence of compounded things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

					<p class="f4">This saying of mine,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever is experienced,<br />

					of compounded things.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brother, I have seen,<br />
					that the ceasing of the activities is gradual.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br />
					speech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br />
					thought initial and sustained has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br />
					zest has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br />
					inbreathing and outbreathing have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br />
					perception of objects has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br />
					perception of the realm of infinite space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br />

					<p class="f4">There are these six calmings, brother.</p>
					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br />

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br />
