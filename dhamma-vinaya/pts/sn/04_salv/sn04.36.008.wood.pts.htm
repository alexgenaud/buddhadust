					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī,</a><br />
					in Great Grove,<br />
					at the Hall of the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br />
					at eventide<br />
					rising from his solitude<br />
					went to visit the sick-ward,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One addressed the Brethren, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, a brother should meet his end<br />
					collected and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is one collected?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother dwells,<br />
					as regards body,<br />
					contemplating body as transient,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					composed<br />
					and thoughtful,<br />
					by having put away<br />
					in this world<br />
					the dejection arising from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother composed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, in his going forth<br />
					and in his returning<br />
					a brother acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In looking in front<br />
					and looking behind,<br />
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In bending or relaxing (his limbs)<br />
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In wearing his robe<br />
					and bearing outer robe and bowl,<br />
					in eating,<br />
					drinking,<br />
					chewing,<br />
					and tasting<br />
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In easing himself,<br />
					in going,<br />
					standing,<br />
					sitting,<br />
					sleeping,<br />
					waking,<br />
					in speaking<br />
					and keeping silence<br />
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, is a brother composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brethren, a brother should meet his end collected and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, as that brother dwells collected,<br />
					composed,<br />
					earnest,<br />

					strenuous,<br />
					there arises in him<br />
					feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					and he thus understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is arisen in me<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, as that brother dwells collected,<br />
					composed,<br />

					this painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that is owing to something,<br />
					not without cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to what?</p>

					arisen owing to something.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is owing to this impermanent contact,<br />
					which has so arisen,<br />
					this painful feeling has arisen,<br />
					and how can that be permanent?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he dwells contemplating impermanence<br />
					in contact and painful feeling,<br />
					he dwells contemplating their transience,<br />
					their waning,<br />
					their ceasing,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, as that brother dwells collected,<br />
					composed,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					there arises in him<br />
					feeling that is neutral,<br />
					and he thus understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is arisen in me<br />
					this neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that is owing to something,<br />
					not without cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to this same contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this contact is impermanent,<br />
					compounded,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is owing to this impermanent contact,<br />

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My bodily endurance has reached its limit.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling that life has reached its limit.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Life has reached its limit'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When body breaks up,<br />
					after life is used up,<br />
					all my experiences in this world<br />
					will lose their lure<br />
					and grow cold.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Brethren, because of oil<br />
					and because of a wick<br />
					a lamp keeps burning,<br />
					but, when oil and wick are used up,<br />
					the lamp would go out<br />
					because it is not fed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, a brother,<br />
					when he feels a feeling<br />

					<p class="f4">He understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My bodily endurance has reached its limit.</p>
