					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then Tālaputa, the stage-manager,<br />
					came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were actors,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Speaking of stage-players they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A player who on the stage<br />

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time didTālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One in this matter?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time did the Exalted One respond:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time didTālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br />
					say to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were actors,<br />

					<p class="f4">Speaking of stage-players they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One in this matter?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"True it is<br />
					I did not permit your question,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, manager!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will expound this thing to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of those beings, manager,<br />
					who aforetime were not free from lusts,<br />
					but were bound with the bond of lust -<br />
					in such cases,<br />
					a player<br />
					who on the stage<br />
					or in the arena<br />
					brings about lustful states of mind,<br />
					so that such beings become still more lustful;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of those beings, manager,<br />
					who aforetime were not free from resentment,<br />
					but were bound with the bond of resentment -<br />
					in such cases,<br />
					a player<br />
					who on the stage<br />
					or in the arena<br />
					brings about resentful states of mind,<br />
					so that such beings become still more resentful;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of those beings, manager,<br />
					who aforetime were not free from illusion,<br />
					but were bound with the bond of illusion -<br />
					in such cases,<br />
					a player<br />
					who on the stage<br />
					or in the arena<br />
					brings about illusory states of mind,<br />
					so that such beings become still more deluded;</p>

					<p class="f4">being himself drugged and slothful,<br />
					he drugs and makes others slothful, -<br />
					such an one,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death is reborn in the Purgatory of Laughter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now if his view of the matter is as you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever player on the stage<br />
					or in the arena<br />
					makes people laugh<br />
					and delights them<br />
					by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death is reborn in the company of the Laughing Devas,'</p>

					<p class="f4">then I declare his view is perverted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, manager, I declare<br />
					that for one who is guilty of perverted view<br />
					there are two paths open,<br />
					one is Purgatory<br />
					and the other is rebirth as an animal."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br />
					cried aloud<br />
					and burst into tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One: -]</p>

					<p class="f4">"That was why I disallowed your question, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, manager!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> "But, lord, I am not lamenting for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">I lament at the thought<br />
					that for many a long day<br />
					I have been cheated,<br />
					deceived<br />
					and led astray<br />
					by teacher after teacher,<br />
					actors,<br />
					in the belief that a player on the stage<br />
					or in the arena<br />
					makes people laugh<br />
					and delights them<br />
					by his counterfeiting of the truth,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death is reborn in the company of the Laughing Devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the Exalted One I go for refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">O that I might gain ordination from the Exalted One,<br />
					that I might gain full ordination."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Tālapuṭa, the stage-manager,<br />
					got ordination from the Exalted One,<br />
					got full ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after doing so<br />
					the venerable Tālapuṭa,<br />
					dwelling solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br />
					to win which<br />
					the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br />
					to the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that in that very life,<br />
					of himself,<br />
					he fully understood it,<br />
					realized it<br />
					and abode therein,<br />
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Tālapuṭa, was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
