					<p class="f4">Then a number of brethren came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> sat at one side, the Exalted One said to them: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, brethren, is feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the arising of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the ceasing of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What the way leading to the ceasing of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the misery?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the refuge from feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br />
					if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds closely and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord," replied the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, brethren:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling,<br />
					neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are called feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the arising of contact<br />
					comes the arising of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the ceasing of contact<br />
					comes the ceasing of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Ariyan Eightfold Path<br />
					is the way leading to the ceasing of feelings,<br />
					namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right belief,<br />
					right intention,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right living,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right contemplation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That pleasure, that mental ease which arises owing to feeling, - that is called</p>

					<p class="f4">'the satisfaction of feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As to the feelings which are impermanent, painful, changeable by nature, - these are called</p>

					<p class="f4">'the misery of feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust for feeling,<br />
					that abandoning of desire and lust for feeling, -<br />
					that is the refuge from feeling.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, brethren, I have seen,<br />
					the ceasing of the activities to be gradual.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br />
					speech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br />
					thought initial and sustained has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br />
					zest has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br />
					inbreathing and outbreathing have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br />
					perception of objects has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br />
					perception of the realm of infinite space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br />
					the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					the perception of the realm of nothingness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both perception and feeling have ceased<br />
					when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					lust is extinguished,<br />
					hatred is extinguished,<br />
					illusion is extinguished.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brethren, I have seen<br />
					that the mastery of the activities is gradual.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br />
					speech is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br />
					thought initial and sustained is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br />
					zest is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br />
					inbreathing and outbreathing is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite space,<br />
					perception of objects is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of infinite consciousness,<br />
					perception of the realm of infinite space is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of nothingness,<br />
					the perception of the realm of infinite consciousness is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					the perception of the realm of nothingness is mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both perception and feeling are mastered<br />
					when one has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					lust is mastered,<br />
					hatred is mastered,<br />
					illusion is mastered.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six calmings, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the first trance,<br />
					speech is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the second trance,<br />
					thought initial and sustained is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the third trance,<br />
					zest is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one has attained the fourth trance,<br />
					inbreathing and outbreathing is calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the trance where perception and feeling have ceased,<br />
					perception and feeling are calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					lust is calmed down,<br />
					hatred is calmed down,<br />
					illusion is calmed down."</p>
