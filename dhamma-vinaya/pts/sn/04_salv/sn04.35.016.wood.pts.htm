					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, I practised the search after<br />

					<p class="f4">So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br />

					the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br />
					the misery of it as such,<br />
					the way of escape from it as such, -<br />

					unsurpassed in the world<br />
					with its devas,<br />
					its <i>Māras,</i><br />
					its Brahmas,<br />

					<p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I did thoroughly understand,<br />

					the way of escape from it as such, -<br />

					<p class="f4">Then indeed the knowledge arose in me<br />
					and insight arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'</p>
