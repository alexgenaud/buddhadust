					<p class="f4">O<span class="f2">NCE</span> the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna</a> the Great was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br />
					addressed the brethren, saving:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, brother," replied those brethren<br />
					to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, when I was meditating alone here,<br />
					this consideration arose in me:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'They say "the second trance,<br />
					the second trance!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the second trance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, friends, this occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein when a brother,<br />
					by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					attains the inward calm,<br />
					that one-pointedness of will,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					zestful and full of ease,<br />
					which is the second trance,<br />
					and abides therein,<br />
					this is called the second trance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, friends, by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					attaining the inward calm,<br />
					that one-pointedness of will,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					zestful and full of ease,<br />
					entered on the second trance<br />
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I had so done<br />
					(and had emerged from trance),<br />
					perception and work of mind<br />
					connected with directed thought<br />
					still continued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, friends, the Exalted One<br />
					by magic power<br />
					came to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna,<br />
					Moggallāna,<br />
					be not remiss in the second trance, brahmin!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make steadfast thy mind in the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the second trance make the mind one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the second trance compose the mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">So after that, friends, by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					attaining the inward calm,<br />
					that one-pointedness of will,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					zestful and full of ease,<br />
					I entered upon<br />
					and abode in the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, if anyone would say rightly:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br />
					the disciple won great super-knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he would say of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Helped by the Master<br />
					did the disciple win great super-knowledge.'"</p>
