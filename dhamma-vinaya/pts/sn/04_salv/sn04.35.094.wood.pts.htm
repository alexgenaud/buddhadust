					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There then he addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these six spheres of contact, Brethren,<br />

					which is untamed,<br />
					unguarded,<br />
					unwatched,<br />
					unrestrained,<br />
					a bringer of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Well-Farer having thus spoken,<br />
					the Master added this further: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He meets with ill, Brethren, who hath not tamed<br />
							The sixfold impact of the sphere of sense.<br />
							They who have learned the mastery of these,<br />
							With faith for comrade, - they dwell free from lust.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Beholding with the eye delightful things<br />
							Or things unlovely, let him restrain his bent<br />
							To lust for loveliness; - and let him not<br />
							Corrupt his heart with thoughts of 'O 'tis dear.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> And when, again, sounds sweet or harsh he hears,<br />
							Not led astray by sweetness, let him check<br />
							The error of his senses. Let him not<br />
							Corrupt his heart with thoughts of '0 'tis sweet.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If some delightful fragrance meet the nose,<br />
							And then again some foul malodorous stench,<br />
							Let him restrain repugnance for that stench,<br />
							Nor yet be led by lust for what is sweet.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Should he taste savours that are sweet and choice,<br />
							And then again what's bitter to the tongue,<br />
							He should not greedily devour the sweet,<br />
							Nor yet show loathing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> for the bitter taste.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">By pleasures' impact not inebriate,<br />
							Nor yet distracted by the touch of pain,<br />
							To pain and pleasure both indifferent<br />
							Let him be free from likings and dislikes.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Obsessed (by lusts) are others:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> so obsessed<br />
							They know and so they fare. But he dispels<br />
							All the world's vulgar fashionings of mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And treads the path renunciation-bound.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">By contact of these six, if mind be trained,<br />
							The heart is never shaken any more.<br />
							O'ercome these two, O Brethren, - lust and hate.<br />
							Pass ye beyond the bounds of birth and death.</p>
