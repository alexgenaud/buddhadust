					<p class="f4">2. "Before I was enlightened, brethren,<br />
					with higher enlightenment,<br />
					when I was yet a Bodhisat,<br />
					I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those worldly sensual elements,<br />
					formerly experienced by my thought,<br />
					are past,<br />
					perished<br />
					and altered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein my thought might run riot<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					when they are present,<br />
					or shrink away<br />
					when they are not yet arisen.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'As to those worldly sensual elements,<br />
					therein I ought,<br />
					for my own sake,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to practise watchfulness<br />
					and concentration of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br />
					as to those worldly sensual elements<br />
					experienced by thought,<br />
					which are passed,<br />
					perished<br />
					and altered,<br />
					therein your thoughts may run riot<br />
					when they are present,<br />
					or shrink away<br />
					when they are not yet arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br />
					in your case also,<br />
					as to these worldly sensual elements,<br />
					ye ought,<br />
					for your own sakes,<br />
					to practise watchfulness<br />
					and concentration of mind.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>Bhk. Bodhi has translated:<br />
							'...that base should be understood where the eye ceases and perception of forms fades away.<br />
							That base should be understood ... ear and sounds ... mind and mental phenomena fades away.<br />
							That base should be understood.'<br />
							The problem is an 'extra' <i>ye āyatane veditabbe.</i><br />
							Woodward's: 'what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere', or Bhk. Bodhi's: 'that base should be understood'.<br />
							In the Pali the 'extra' phrase comes at the beginning which sounds strange to us and has been placed at the end by Bhk. Bodhi as a sort of summary. In fact, what it looks like is that the summary coming at the beginning, was the teaching in brief and that the individual sense spheres were mistakenly added in there, and where the Buddha is being quoted, by the editors rendering the whole idea of why this statement was not obvious to the bhikkhus a mystery<br />
							as Ānanda's explanation is nothing more than this expansion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though you had the Master face to face<br />
					you passed over that Exalted One,<br />
					and think that I am the one to be questioned on this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friends, that Exalted One is one who,<br />
					knowing, knoweth:<br />
					who, seeing, seeth:<br />
					who hath become the seer,<br />
					who hath become the knower,<br />
					who hath become the Norm,<br />
					who hath become the highest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Proclaimer and expounder is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispenser of good,<br />
					giver of the immortal,<br />
					Lord of the Norm,<br />
					Tathāgata is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely that was the time<br />
					for you to ask the Exalted One this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the Exalted One should reply to you,<br />
					that should ye bear in mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'True it is, friend Ānanda,<br />
					that the Exalted One is one who,<br />
					knowing, knoweth:<br />
					who, seeing, seeth:<br />
					who hath become the seer,<br />
					who hath become the knower,<br />
					who hath become the Norm,<br />
					who hath become the highest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Proclaimer and expounder is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispenser of good,<br />
					giver of the immortal,<br />
					Lord of the Norm,<br />
					Tathāgata is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely that was the time<br />
					for us to ask the Exalted One this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the Exalted One should reply,<br />
					that we should bear in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still we thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here is this venerable Ānanda,<br />
					one praised by the Master<br />
					and honoured by intelligent co-mates of the righteous life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda is capable of expounding in detail<br />
					the meaning of this pronouncement made in brief<br />
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we go to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					suppose we come before the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and question him as to the meaning of this thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the venerable Ānanda expound the meaning,<br />
					and not put us to further trouble.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, listen, friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, friend,' we replied to the venerable Ānanda, who said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to that pronouncement uttered in brief by the Exalted One,<br />
					but without expounding its meaning in detail:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, as to those worldly sensual elements<br />
					experienced by thought,<br />
					which are passed,<br />
					perished<br />
					and altered,<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein eye and perception of objects fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein ear and perception of sounds fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein nose and perception of scents fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein tongue and perception of savours fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein mind and perception of mind-states fade away-</p>

					<p class="f4">in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere,<br />
					ye ought,<br />
					for your own sakes,<br />
					to practise watchfulness<br />
					and concentration of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">thus do I understand it, friends:</p>

					<p class="f4">It was uttered, friends,<br />
					by the Exalted One concerning the sixfold sphere of sense,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, brethren, as to those worldly sensual elements<br />
					experienced by thought,<br />
					which are passed,<br />
					perished<br />
					and altered,<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein eye and perception of objects fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein ear and perception of sounds fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein nose and perception of scents fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein tongue and perception of savours fade away, -<br />
					in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere: -<br />
					wherein mind and perception of mind-states fade away-</p>

					<p class="f4">in what is to be regarded as a sense-sphere,<br />
					ye ought,<br />
					for your own sakes,<br />
					to practise watchfulness<br />
					and concentration of mind"<br />
					- so do I understand the meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if ye wish it,<br />
					ye venerable ones should approach the Exalted One<br />
					and question him about the matter, and,<br />
					according as the Exalted One explains it,<br />
					so do ye bear it in mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, friend,' we replied to the venerable Ānanda and then rising up we came to the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One replied: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage, brethren, is Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of great wisdom, brethren, is Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">If ye were to put me this question, I should explain it even as Ānanda explained it to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning of that thing, and so do ye bear it in mind."</p>
