The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind were not self in the past, will be not self in the future and are not self now and that seeing that one should strive to be repelled by them, become dispassionate towards them, and look for their ending." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, brethren, is void of the self,<br />

					seeks dispassion for it,<br />
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>
