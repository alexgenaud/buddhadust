					<p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/citto_gahapati.htm">Citta, the housefather,</a> went to visit those elder  <a id="pg197"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span></a> Brethren,<br />
					and on coming to them<br />
					saluted them<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Citta, the housefather, said to those elder brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the housefather,<br />
					understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br />
					rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the elder brethren by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br />
					robed themselves at early dawn,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					went to the dwelling of Citta, the housefather,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on seats prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather,<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served the elder brethren<br />
					with choice butter and milk-rice<br />
					till they had eaten enough.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the elder brethren had eaten their fill<br />
					and withdrawn hand from bowl<br />
					they rose from their seats<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Citta, the housefather,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gather up the remains,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">followed in the steps of the elder brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					there was a sweltering<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> heat,<br />
					and the elder brethren walked<br />
					with bodies melting away,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> methinks,<br />
					since they had eaten well of the meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time<br />
					the venerable Mahaka was the junior<br />
					of that company of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the venerable Mahaka<br />
					to the venerable Chief Elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"It were well, my lord Chief,<br />
					if a cool wind should blow<br />
					and there were a thunderstorm<br />
					and the sky should rain down drop by drop."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"It were indeed well, friend Mahaka,<br />
					if a cool wind should blow<br />
					and there were a thunderstorm<br />
					and the sky should rain down drop by drop."|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Mahaka so wrought by magic <a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> power that a cool wind blew<br />
					and there was a thunderstorm<br />
					and the sky rained down drop by drop.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Citta, the housefather, had this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, even the junior of this company of brethren<br />
					has such magic power!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the venerable Mahaka reached the Pleasance<br />
					he said to the venerable chief elder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough of this, lord!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend Mahaka,<br />
					enough of this!|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">You have done enough.</p>

					<p class="f4">Service enough<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> has heen done, friend Mahaka."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the elder brethren went to the residence,<br />
					but the venerable Mahaka went to his own lodging.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather, came to see the venerable Mahaka,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the housefather,<br />
					said to the venerable Mahaka: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, sir,<br />
					if the worthy Mahaka would show me something superhuman,<br />
					some miracle of magic."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, housefather,<br />
					do you put a cloak on the verandah<br />
					and scatter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> a bundle of grass."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, sir,"<br />
					said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					and did as he was bidden.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahaka went into his lodging<br />
					and shot the bolt of the door,<br />
					and so wrought by magic power<br />
					that a flame came through the keyhole<br />
					and the parts about the door-bar<br />
					and set the grass on fire<br />
					but not the cloak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather,<br />
					in alarm,<br />
					with hair on end,<br />
					beat out the cloak<br />
					and stood aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahaka came out of his lodging<br />
					and said to Citta, the housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough of this, housefather!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, my lord Mahaka,<br />
					enough of this!</p>

					<p class="f4">Enough has been done, my lord Mahaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enough service has been done, my lord Mahaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my lord, the worthy Mahaka,<br />
					take his pleasure in Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delightful is Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will do my best to supply the worthy Mahaka<br />
					with the requisites of robes<br />
					and alms,<br />
					and lodging,<br />
					comforts<br />
					and medicines in time of sickness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is kindly said, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahaka,<br />
					having set his lodging in order, <a id="pg199"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span></a><br />
					took bowl and outer robe<br />
					and left Macchikasaṇḍa, and in thus departing from Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					he was gone for good<br />
					and came not back again.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
