<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 8. The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks Gotama a series of questions about existence and non-existence and is told in all cases that these are not questions on which the Buddha has made a declarative statement. When asked why this is so, Gotama explains that it is only because of holding views about the self with regard to form, sense-expeience, own-making, and consciousness that these questions arise and that not holding such views the questions do not arise. Vaccha then goes to Maha Moggallāna and puts the same questions and receives the same answers." />
