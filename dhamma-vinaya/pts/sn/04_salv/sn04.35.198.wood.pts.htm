					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Proficient in three ways, Brethren,<br />
					a brother dwells to the full<br />
					with ease and pleasure in this very life,<br />
					and he has strong grounds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what three things?</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps guard on the door of the faculties,<br />
					he is moderate in eating,<br />
					he is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother<br />
					keep guard on the door of the faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a brother,<br />
					seeing an object with the eye,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the nose he smells a scent,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of nose uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of nose,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the tongue he tastes a savour,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of tongue uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with body he contacts tangibles,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of body uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of body,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with mind he cognizes a mind-state,<br />
					<a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of ear uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, on level ground<br />
					at the crossing of the four highways<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a car be drawn by thoroughbreds,<br />
					with a goad set in rest therein,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and a clever trainer,<br />
					a driver who tames steeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He mounts thereon,<br />
					with his left hand holding the reins,<br />
					and in his right he takes the goad,<br />
					and drives the car forward and backward,<br />
					whither and how he wills.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, a brother practises the guard over the six faculties,<br />
					he practises for their restraint,<br />
					for their taming,<br />
					for their calming.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how a brother keeps a guard over the faculties.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother takes his food<br />
					thoughtfully and prudently,<br />
					not for sport,<br />
					not for indulgence,<br />
					not for personal charm and adornment,<br />
					but sufficient for the support<br />
					and upkeep of body,<br />
					to allay its pains,<br />
					to help the practice of the righteous life,<br />
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br />
					and set on foot<br />
					no new feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br />
					be blameless<br />
					and live at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man, Brethren, anoints a wound<br />
					just for the healing of it,<br />
					or just as he oils an axle<br />
					enough for carrying the load,<br />
					even so<br />
					thoughtfully and prudently<br />
					does a brother take his food,<br />
					not for sport,<br />
					not for indulgence,<br />
					not for personal charm and adornment,<br />
					but sufficient for the support<br />
					and upkeep of body,<br />
					to allay its pains,<br />
					to help the practice of the righteous life,<br />
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br />
					and set on foot<br />
					no new feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br />
					be blameless<br />
					and live at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how a brother is moderate in eating.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother given to watchfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, by day<br />
					a brother walks up and down and sits,<br />
					and so cleanses his heart<br />
					from states that may hinder.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">By night, for the first watch,<br />
					a brother walks up and down and sits,<br />
					and so cleanses his heart<br />
					from states that may hinder.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br />
					lying on his right side,<br />
					he takes up the posture of a lion,<br />
					resting one foot on the other,<br />
					and thus collected and composed<br />
					fixes his thought on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br />
					at early dawn,<br />
					he walks up and <a id="pg112"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></a> down and sits,<br />
					and so cleanses his heart<br />
					from states that may hinder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, is a brother given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Brethren, possessed of these three things,<br />
					a brother dwells to the full<br />
					with ease and pleasure in this very life,<br />
					and so has strong grounds<br />
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>
