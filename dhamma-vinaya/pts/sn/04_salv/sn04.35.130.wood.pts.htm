					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br />
					and after the exchange of courtesies and greetings<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"It has been said by the Exalted One, sir,|| ||</p>
