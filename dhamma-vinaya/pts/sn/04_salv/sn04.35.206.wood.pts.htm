					<p class="f4">Its grasses and thorns<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, a man catches six animals,<br />
					of diverse range<br />

					and tethers them with a stout rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">He catches a snake<br />
					and tethers it with a stout rope:<br />
					he catches a crocodile,<br />
					and tethers it with a stout rope:<br />
					he catches a bird,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having done so, Brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, those six animals<br />
					of diverse range<br />
					and diverse pasturage<br />
					would struggle<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> to be off,<br />
					each one to his own range and pasture.</p>

					<p class="f4">The snake would struggle, thinking:<br />
					'I'll enter the anthill'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The crocodile would struggle, thinking:<br />
					'I'll enter the water'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The bird would struggle, thinking:<br />
					'I'll mount<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> into the air'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dog would struggle, thinking:<br />

					<p class="f4">The jackal would struggle, thinking:<br />

					<p class="f4">The monkey would struggle, thinking:<br />
					'I'll be off to the forest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, when those six hungry<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> animals grew weary,<br />
					they would follow after<br />
					the one of them that was stronger,<br />
					they would conform to that one,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they would become subject to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, in whatsoever brother<br />

					the eye struggles to pull him<br />

					<p class="f4">Repulsive to him<br />

					<p class="f4">Repulsive to him<br />
					are sounds that displease.</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose struggles to pull him<br />
					with scents that charm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Repulsive to him<br />
					are scents that displease.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue struggles to pull him<br />
					with savours that charm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Repulsive to him<br />
