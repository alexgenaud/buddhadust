					is it fitting to regard that as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the eye,<br />
					is repelled by objects,<br />
					is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by eye-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to eye-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the ear,<br />
					is repelled by sounds,<br />
					is repelled by ear-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by ear-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to ear-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the nose,<br />
					is repelled by scents,<br />
					is repelled by nose-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by nose-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to nose-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the tongue,<br />
					is repelled by savours,<br />
					is repelled by tongue-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by tongue-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to tongue-contact.</p>

					is repelled by the body,<br />
					is repelled by things tactile,<br />
					is repelled by body-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by body-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />

					is repelled by mind-states,<br />
					is repelled by mind-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by mind-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br />
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br />
					comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Brethren, is the way tuat is helpful for Nibbāna.</p>
