The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus that the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are painful and not self and that seeing that brings freedom and recognizing that freedom as freedom rebirth is left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing has been done and there is no more being any sort of an it at any place of atness left for one." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, brethren,<br />
					is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine:<br />
					I am not it:<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					with perfect insight<br />
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine:<br />
					I am not it:<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					with perfect insight<br />
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine:<br />
					I am not it:<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					with perfect insight<br />
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine:<br />
					I am not it:<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					with perfect insight<br />
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine:<br />
					I am not it:<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					with perfect insight<br />
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ill,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine:<br />
					I am not it:<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					with perfect insight<br />
					of what it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by eye,<br />
					ear,<br />
					nose,<br />
					tongue,<br />
					body,<br />
					and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by them,<br />
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting,<br />
					he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br />
					comes insight of being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
