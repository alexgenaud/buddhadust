					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side he said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, in such and such a lodging<br />
					there is a brother,<br />
					a novice,<br />
					of no reputation.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One should visit that brother,<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					on hearing the words 'novice'<br />
					and 'sick,'<br />
					and finding that he was of no reputation,<br />
					went to where that brother was.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that brother saw the Exalted One coming,<br />
					while yet he was far off,<br />
					and seeing him he stirred upon his bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One (on coming to him)	said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these seats made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit there."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One sat down<br />
					and said to that brother: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not	increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating<br />
					and not increasing?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg24"><span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></a> Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, brother, you have no doubt,<br />
					no remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, lord, I have no little doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have no little remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I hope that as to morals<br />
					you yourself make no reproach."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brother, if that is so,<br />
					you must have some doubt,<br />
					you must have some regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I do not understand<br />
					the meaning of the purity of life<br />
					in the Norm taught by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brother, if you do not understand the meaning<br />
					of the purity of life<br />
					in the Norm taught by me,<br />
					in what sense do you understand it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Passion and the destruction of passion, lord, -<br />
					that is what I understand<br />
					to be the Norm taught by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed do you understand<br />
					the meaning of the Norm taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it means passion<br />
					and the destruction of passion.</p>

							<p><i>ipsissima verba</i> his own words. OED: the precise words. I believe this idea is mistaken and that in fact the practice was, throughout the culture and throughout the (more or less civilized world) at the time, to use formula expressions in numerous circumstances. The idea that these formulas aid memory is correct, but it is unreasonable to think that what was useful to the memory would not be used and quickly be understood as the correct way to respond to questions from the master. Further as a review of the expressions used even today [Tuesday, April 07, 2015 6:38 AM] in the forums would show, the tendency is to express one's self in the terms used in the translations which reflects at least the tendency of the convert to imitate the master in every way. The fact is that when the Buddha spoke he expressed himself in the most clear and precise way possible. Those who had heard him speak would tend to express the master's ideas <i>ipsissima verba</i>. Why would one want to use less clear language?</p>
