					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Mallas<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup><br />
					</span> at Uruvelakappa, a township of the Mallas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhadragaka, the headman, came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Bhadragaka, the headman, said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me<br />
					the arising and the coming to an end of Ill."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"If I were to teach you, headman,<br />
					the arising and the coming to an end of Ill,<br />
					beginning with past time, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus it was in the past,'</p>

					<p class="f4">you would have doubt and perplexity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And if, headman, I were to teach you<br />
					the arising and the coming to an end of Ill,<br />
					beginning with future time, sayhing,</p>

					<p class="f4">'So will it be in the future,'</p>

					<p class="f4">you would likewise have doubt and perplexity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But sitting here and now, headman,<br />
					with you sitting here also,<br />
					I will teach you the arising and the coming to an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you listen attentively.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord," replied Bhadragaka to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg233"><span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span></a> The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there any men in Uruvelakappa<br />
					owing to whose death<br />
					or imprisonment<br />
					or loss<br />
					or blame<br />
					there would come upon you sorrow and suffering,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are such men in Uruvelakappa, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, headman, are there any men in Uruvelakappa<br />
					owing to whose death<br />
					or imprisonment<br />
					or loss<br />
					or blame,<br />
					no sorrow and suffering,<br />
					no woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair would come upon you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are such men in Uruvelakappa, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, headman, what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why sorrow and suffering,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					would come upon you<br />
					in respect of some,<br />
					but not of the others?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the case of those, lord,<br />
					owing to whose death<br />
					or imprisonment<br />
					or loss<br />
					or blame<br />
					I should suffer sorrow and suffering,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					it is because I have desire and longing for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in the case of the others, lord,<br />
					owing to whose death<br />
					or imprisonment<br />
					or loss<br />
					or blame,<br />
					I should suffer no sorrow and suffering,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					it is because I have not such desire and longing."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"You say,<br />
					'I have not such desire and longing for them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, headman, do you shape your course<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> by this Norm,<br />
					when you have seen and known it,<br />
					when you have reached it without loss of time,<br />
					— plunged into it both in respect of the past<br />
					and of the future, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Ill arising<br />
					has come upon me in the past,<br />
					— all that is rooted in desire,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is joined to desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever Ill arising<br />
					may come upon me in future time,<br />
					— all that is rooted in desire,<br />
					is joined to desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire is the root of Ill."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wonderful, lord!<br />
					Strange it is, lord,<br />
					how well said is this saying of the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever Ill arising comes upon me,<br />
					— all that is rooted in desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire is indeed the root of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, there is my boy,<br />
					— Ciravāsi is his name.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lodges away from here.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At the time of rising up, lord,<br />
					I send off a man, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, my man, inquire of Ciravāsi."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg234"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></a> Then, lord, till that man comes back again,<br />
					I am in an anxious state,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					fearing lest some sickness may have befallen Ciravāsi."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair come upon you<br />
					if your boy Ciravāsi were slain<br />
					or imprisoned<br />
					or had loss<br />
					or blame?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, if such were to befall my boy Ciravāsi,<br />
					how should I not have sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, headman, you must regard it in this manner:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever Ill arising comes upon me,<br />
					— all that is rooted in desire,<br />
					is joined to desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire is indeed the root of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you did not see,<br />
					did not hear Ciravāsi's mother,<br />
					did you feel desire<br />
					or longing<br />
					or affection for her?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, headman, when you got sight of her,<br />
					got hearing of her,<br />
					did you then have desire<br />
					or longing<br />
					or affection for her?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair come upon you<br />
					if Ciravāsi's mother were slain<br />
					or imprisoned<br />
					or had any loss or blame?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why surely, lord, sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					would come upon me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So in this manner, headman,<br />
					must you look upon it:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever Ill arising may come upon me,<br />
					— all that is rooted in desire,<br />
					is joined to desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire is indeed the root of Ill.'"</p>
