					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta and the venerable Koṭṭhika the Great were staying near Benares,<br />
					at Isipatana in the Antelope Park.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[2]</span> Then the venerable Koṭṭhika the Great,<br />
					rising from his solitude at eventide,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3]</span> So seated<br />
					he said to the venerable Sāriputta: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"How now, friend?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the eye the bond of objects,<br />
					or are objects the bond of the eye?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the ear the bond of sounds,<br />
					or are sounds the bond of the ear?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the nose the bond of scents,<br />
					or are scents the bond of the nose?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the tongue the bond of savours,<br />
					or are savours the bond of the tongue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the body the bond of tangibles,<br />
					or are tangibles the bond of the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is mind the bond of mind-states,<br />
					or are mind-states the bond of the mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[4]</span> "Not so, friend Koṭṭhika.</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye is not the bond of objects,<br />
					nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br />
					but that desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to these two,<br />
					that is the bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear is not the bond of sounds,<br />
					nor are sounds the bond of the ear,<br />
					but that desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to these two,<br />

					<p class="f4">The nose is not the bond of scents,<br />
					nor are scents the bond of the nose,<br />
					but that desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to these two,<br />
					that is the bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue is not the bond of savours,<br />
					nor are savours the bond of the tongue,<br />

					owing to these two,<br />

					<p class="f4">The mind is not the bond of mind-states,<br />
					nor are mind-states the bond of the mind,<br />
					but that desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to these two,<br />
					that is the bond.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[5]</span> Suppose, friend,<br />
					two oxen,<br />
					one white and one black,<br />
					tied by one rope<br />
					or one yoke-tie.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would one be right in saying<br />
					that the black ox is the bond for the white one,<br />
					or that the white ox is the bond for the black one?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the rope<br />

					that is the bond that unites them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is that the eye is not the bond of objects,<br />
					nor are objects the bond of the eye,<br />
					but that desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to these two,<br />
					that is the bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear is not the bond of sounds,<br />

					<p class="f4">The tongue is not the bond of savours,<br />
					nor are savours the bond of the tongue,<br />
					but that desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to these two,<br />
					that is the bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is not the bond of tangibles,<br />
