					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nalanda</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the headman,<br />
					came to see the Exalted One and,<br />
					on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the brahmins of the west,<br />
					who are carriers of waterpots,<br />
					wearers of lily-garlands,<br />
					purifiers by water,<br />
					fire-worshippers,<br />
					when a man has died<br />
					and made an end, -<br />
					they lift him up<br />
					and carry him out,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					call on him by name<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and speed him heavenwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One,<br />
					who is Arahant,<br />
					an All-enlightened One,<br />
					is able to bring it about<br />
					that the whole world,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death<br />
					can be reborn in the Happy Lot,<br />
					in the Heaven World."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to that, headman, I will question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may reply as you think fit.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a case<br />
					where a man is a taker of life,<br />
					a taker of what is not <a id="pg219"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> given,<br />
					a wrong-doer in respect of sensual passion,<br />

					of malevolent heart,<br />
					of perverted view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great multitude gathers<br />
					and throngs together,<br />
					aspires and praises him<br />
					and goes about with uplifted palms,<br />

					<p class="f4">'May this man,<br />

					after death be reborn<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> in the Happy Lot,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray would that man,<br />
					owing to the aspirations and praises<br />
					of that great multitude,<br />
					owing to their going about<br />
					with uplifted palms, -<br />
					would that man,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />

					in the Heaven World?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, headman, suppose a man hurls<br />
					a huge, great rock<br />
					into a deep,<br />
					deep pool of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great multitude gathers<br />
					and throngs together<br />
					and aspires<br />
					and praises it<br />
					and goes about with uplifted palms,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rise up, good rock!</p>

					<p class="f4">Float up, good rock!</p>

					<p class="f4">Float ashore, good rock!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that huge, great rock,<br />
					because of the aspirations,<br />
					because of the praises,<br />
					because of the going about with uplifted palms<br />
					of that great multitude, -<br />
					would it rise up or float up or float ashore?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, headman,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that in this case<br />

					aspire<br />

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose again, headman,<br />
					a man plunges a jar of butter<br />

					<p class="f4">Then suppose a great multitude,<br />

					<p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point out the way<br />

					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br />
