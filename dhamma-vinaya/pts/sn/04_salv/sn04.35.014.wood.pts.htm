					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, brethren,<br />
					while I was yet unenlightened and a Bodhisat,<br />
					I had this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the misery of objects?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way of escape from objects?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the misery of the sounds?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way of escape from sounds?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the misery of scents?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way of escape from scents?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the misery of savours?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way of escape from savours?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the misery of things tactile?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way of escape from things tactile?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the misery of mind-states?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the way of escape from mind-states?'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That ease,<br />
					that pleasure<br />
					that arises owing to objects, -<br />
					that is the satisfaction of objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">That impermanence,<br />

					that instability<br />
					which is objects, -<br />
					that is the misery of objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">That restraint of desire and lust,<br />
					that renouncing of desire and lust<br />
					which are in objects, -<br />
					that is the way of escape from objects.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now so long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br />
					the misery of it as such,<br />
					the way of escape from it as such, -<br />
					so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br />
					whether I was enlightened<br />
					with that supreme enlightenment,<br />
					unsurpassed in the world<br />
					with its devas,<br />
					its <i>Māras,</i><br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					among the host of recluses and brahmins<br />
					and of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I did thoroughly understand,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the satisfaction of this sixfold external sphere of sense as such,<br />
					the misery of it as such,<br />
					the way of escape from it as such, -<br />
					no longer, brethren, was I doubtful<br />
					whether I was enlightened<br />
					with that supreme enlightenment,<br />
					unsurpassed in the world<br />
					with its devas,<br />
					its <i>Māras,</i><br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					among the host of recluses and brahmins<br />
					and of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then indeed the knowledge arose in me<br />
					and insight arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'"</p>
