					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from objects,<br />
					beings would not lust after objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in objects,<br />
					therefore beings lust after objects.</p>
