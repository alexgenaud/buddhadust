					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as the Exalted One was meditating in solitude this <a id="pg65"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></a> thought occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ripe now in Rāhula<br />
					are those states<br />
					that bring release to perfection.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I give Rāhula<br />
					the last teachings<br />
					for the destruction of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/asavas.htm"><i>āsavas.</i></a></p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One,<br />
					robing himself at early dawn,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					set out for Sāvatthī on his begging-round,<br />
					and after completing his round<br />
					and eating his meal,<br />
					said to the venerable Rahula: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rāhula, take a mat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go to Dark Wood<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> for the noonday rest."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, lord,"<br />
					replied the venerable Rāhula to the Exalted One,<br />
					and taking a mat<br />
					followed behind<br />
					in the footsteps of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					countless thousands of devas<br />
					were following the Exalted One, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"To-day the Exalted One will give the venerable Rāhula<br />
					the last teachings<br />
					for the destruction of the <i>āsavas.</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One plunged into the depths of Dark Wood<br />
					and sat down at the foot of a certain tree<br />
					on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br />
					saluting the Exalted One,<br />
					sat down also at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br />
					the Exalted One said to the venerable Rāhula: -</p>
