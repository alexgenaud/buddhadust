						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 mart6">
							<p>This sutta seems out of place in that in the previous two suttas Asibandhaka's Son, the headman has taken refuge with the Buddha and thus is not a follower of the Nigaṇṭhas. Perhaps this should have been "...once a follower of ..."; or perhaps things were as confused in those days as they are now and he was a follower of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />

					came to see the Exalted One and,<br />
					on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br />
					the Exalted One said to him: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Headman, in what way does the Unclothed, Nata's Son,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Thus, lord, does the Unclothed, Nata's Son,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whosoever taketh what is not given, -<br />

					<p class="f4">Whosoever acts wrongly in respect of sensual <a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> passion, -<br />

					<p class="f4">According as a man habitually<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> lives,<br />

					<p class="f4">That, lord, is how the Unclothed, Nata's Son,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But you say, headman:</p>
