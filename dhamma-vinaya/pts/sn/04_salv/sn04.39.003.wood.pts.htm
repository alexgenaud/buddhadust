					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vajjians">Vajjī,</a><br />
					at Ukkāvelā<br />
					on the banks of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sāmaṇḍaka, the Wanderer, came to visit the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Wanderer Sāmaṇḍaka said this to the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who, pray, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					are Norm-preachers in the world,<br />
					who are well-practised in the world,<br />
					who are happy ones in the world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They, friend, who teach a Norm<br />
					for abandoning lust in the world,<br />
					for abandoning hatred in the world,<br />
					for abandoning illusion in the world,<br />
					they are Norm-preachers in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">They, friend, who are practised<br />
					in the abandoning of lust,<br />
					in the abandoning of hatred<br />
					in the abandoning of illusion,<br />
					they are well practised in the world.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">They, friend, whose lust is abandoned,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made unable to grow again in the future,<br />
					of a nature not to arise again;<br />
					they whose hatred is abandoned,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made unable to grow again in the future,<br />
					of a nature not to arise again;<br />
					they whose illusion is abandoned,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made unable to grow again in the future,<br />
					of a nature not to arise again -<br />
					they, friend, are happy ones in the world."|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, friend, is there any way,<br />
					any approach<br />
					to the abandoning of this lust,<br />
					this hatred,<br />
					this illusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is such a path, friend,<br />
					there is such an approach."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is that path, friend,<br />
					what is that approach<br />
					to the abandoning of this lust,<br />
					this hatred,<br />
					this illusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this Ariyan Eightfold Path, friend,<br />
					for the abandoning of this lust,<br />
					this hatred,<br />
					this illusion<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view,<br />
					right aim,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right living,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, friend, is this path,<br />
					this approach<br />
					to the abandoning of this lust,<br />
					this hatred,<br />
					this illusion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A goodly path, friend,<br />
					a goodly approach<br />
					to the abandoning of this lust,<br />
					this hatred,<br />
					this illusion<br />
					and a proper occasion for earnestness too, friend!"</p>
