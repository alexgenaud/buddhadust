					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, if there were not this satisfaction which comes from the eye,<br />

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is satisfaction in the eye,<br />

					<p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as beings have not understood,<br />
