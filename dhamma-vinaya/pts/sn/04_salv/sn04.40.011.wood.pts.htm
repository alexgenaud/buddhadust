					<p class="f4">Indeed, my good sir, Moggallāna,<br />
					such going to win possession unwavering<br />
					of the virtues loved by the Ariyans,<br />
					virtues unbroken,<br />
					whole,<br />
					unspotted,<br />
					untarnished,<br />
					giving freedom,<br />
					praised by the wise:<br />
					virtues which are untainted<br />
					(by craving or delusion),<br />
					which lead to concentration of mind,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death,<br />
					some bemgs are born here<br />
					in the Happy Lot,<br />
					in the Heaven World.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these, some devas win excellence in ten things,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					in the heavenly life,<br />
					the heavenly colour,<br />
					the heavenly bliss,<br />
					the heavenly fame,<br />
					the heavenly supremacy,<br />
					in heavenly objects,<br />
					the heavenly sounds,<br />
					the heavenly scents,<br />
					the heavenly savours<br />
					the heavenly things tangible."</p>
