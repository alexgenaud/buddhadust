					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time in the royal palace<br />
					among those of the royal retinue<br />
					who sat together in conclave<br />
					there arose this topic in casual talk:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					are permitted to take gold and silver,<br />
					they let gold and silver be offered,<br />
					the recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					accept gold and silver."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					there sat in that company<br />
					Jewel-crested,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the headman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the headman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"My good sirs, say not that!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not permitted to the recluses<br />
					who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					to take gold and silver,<br />
					to let gold and silver be offered,<br />
					to accept gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejected by them<br />
					are gems<br />
					and gold,<br />
					they have done with gold and silver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Howbeit, Jewel-crested, the headman,<br />
					could not convince that company.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Jewel-crested, the headman,<br />
					went to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					Jewel-crested, the headman, said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, in the royal palace here,<br />
					when those of the royal retinue<br />
					had gathered and were sitting in conclave,<br />
					this topic of casual talk arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					are permitted to take gold and silver,<br />
					they let gold and silver be offered,<br />
					the recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					accept gold and silver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br />
					I said to that company:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 my good sirs,<br />
					say not that!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not so.</p>

					<p class="f4">The recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					do not take gold and silver,<br />
					do not permit the offering of gold and silver,<br />
					do not accept gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejected by them are gems and gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have done with gold and silver.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord, I could not convince that company.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, in so explaining<br />
					did I speak in accordance with the Exalted One's view,<br />
					without misrepresenting the Exalted One<br />
					by stating what is wrong?</p>

					<p class="f4">Did I answer in conformity<br />
					with his teaching,<br />
					so that no one who is of the same view,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a follower of the Exalted One's view,<br />
					could give opportunity for censure?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, headman, in so explaining<br />
					you did speak in accordance with my view.</p>

					<p class="f4">You did not misrepresent me<br />
					by stating what is wrong.</p>

					<p class="f4">You did answer in conformity with my teaching,<br />
					so that no one who is of my view,<br />
					a follower of my view,<br />
					could give opportunity for censure.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, indeed, headman!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not permitted<br />
					to the recluses who are the sons of the Sakyan<br />
					to take gold and silver,<br />
					to let it be offered,<br />
					to accept gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not take gold and silver,<br />
					let gold and silver be offered,<br />
					accept gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejected by them are gems and gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have done with <a id="pg232"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span></a> gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, headman, who is permitted to take gold and silver,<br />
					the five sensual delights are also permitted.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may downright aver, headman,<br />
					of him to whom the taking of gold and silver is permitted<br />
					that he is not a recluse by nature,<br />
					not of the nature of the Sakyan's sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, headman, this do I declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">Grass<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> is to be sought for<br />
					by those in need of grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Firewood is to be sought for<br />
					by those in need of firewood.</p>

					<p class="f4">A cart is to be sought for<br />
					by those in need of a cart.</p>

					<p class="f4">A servant is to be sought for<br />
					by him who is in need of a servant.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, headman, in no manner whatsoever<br />
					do I declare that gold and silver should be accepted<br />
					or sought for."</p>
