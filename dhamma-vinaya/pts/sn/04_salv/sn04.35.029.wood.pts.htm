					<p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br />
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br />
					comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />

					done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>

							<p><i>Aḍḍha-Bhūtaŋ</i> <i>vs</i> <i>andhabhūtam.</i> Bhk. Bodhi agrees with the reading used by Woodward, but translates 'weighed down'. I see no reason to object to <i>andhabhūtam:</i> which would be 'being blinded by'. The difference is orientation towards the being. <i>Aḍḍhabhūtam</i> suggests the affliction by these things of the being; <i>andhabhūtam</i> suggest the being blinded by these things of the mind. The latter would more closely adhere to the aims of the Dhamma.</p>
