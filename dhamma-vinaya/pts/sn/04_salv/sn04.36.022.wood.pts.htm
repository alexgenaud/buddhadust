					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you an exposition of the Norm, brethren,<br />
					according to the method of the one hundred and eight.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, is that exposition of the Norm?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two feelings, brethren,<br />
					in my way of expounding.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also three,<br />
					five,<br />
					six,<br />
					eighteen,<br />
					thirty-six,<br />
					and one hundred and eight feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the two feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are bodily and mental feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the two feelings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the three feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are pleasant, painful and neutral feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the three feelings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the five feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are the controlling powers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of pleasure,<br />
					pain,<br />
					joy,<br />
					grief<br />
					and indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are 'the five feelings'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the six feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are the feeling<br />
					born of eye-contact,<br />
					ear-contact,<br />
					nose-contact,<br />
					tongue-contact,<br />
					body-contact<br />
					and mind-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are 'the six feelings'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the eighteen feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are the six ways of giving attention<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to joy,<br />
					grief<br />
					and indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are 'the eighteen feelings'.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the thirty-six feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are the six forms of joy concerned with the worldly life,<br />
					the six forms of joy concerned with giving up:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they are the six forms of grief concerned with the worldly life<br />
					and six forms of grief concerned with giving up:<br />
					there are six forms of indifference concerned with the worldly life<br />
					and six forms of indifference concerned with giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the thirty-six feelings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the one hundred and eight feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are thirty-six feelings of the past,<br />
					thirty-six of the future,<br />
					and thirty-six feelings of the present time.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are the one hundred and eight feelings,<br />
					and this is the method of expounding the Norm according to the one hundred and eight.</p>
