					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's, Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, brethren, while I was yet unenlightened and a Bodhisat, I had this thought:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now so long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br />
