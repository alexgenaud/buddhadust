					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.41.008.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Nāṭa's Son, had come to Macchikasaṇḍa together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Citta, the housefather, heard it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, has come to Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Citta, the housefather, with a number of followers,<br />
					went to visit the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭa's Son,<br />
					and on coming to him greeted him in friendly wise,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, said to Citta, the housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hast thou faith, housefather,<br />
					in the teaching of Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					that there is a mental balance<br />
					without thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that there is a ceasing<br />
					of thought directed and sustained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, sir, I do not walk with faith<br />
					in the teaching<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					that there is a mental balance<br />
					without thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that there is a ceasing<br />
					of thought directed and sustained."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br />
					looking round<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> on his own company, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have you look, sirs,<br />
					how straight is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how guileless<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how ingenuous is this housefather Citta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, he who should think there can be any ceasing<br />
					of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					might think the mind could be caught in a net,<br />
					or that Gangā's stream<br />
					could be held back with his own fist!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you sir?<br />
					Which is the more excellent,<br />
					knowledge or faith?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, housefather,<br />
					knowledge is more excellent than faith."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					aloof from lusts,<br />
					aloof from states that are evil,<br />
					can enter upon the first trance,<br />
					which is joined with thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of solitude,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and can abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by entering on the inward calm,<br />
					that single-mindedness of will,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sained,<br />
					born of mental blance,<br />
					zestful and full of ease,<br />
					can enter on the second trance and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					by the fading ut of zest<br />
					become balanced<br />
					and remain mindful and composed,<br />
					and experience with the body<br />
					the happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br />
					'The balanced thoughtful man dwells happily'<br />
					can enter on the third trance and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					by abandoning ease and pain,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br />
					can enter on the fourth trance<br />
					which is free of pain and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity of balance and equanimity,<br />
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus knowing, sir,<br />
					thus seeing,<br />
					believing what other recluse or brahmin,<br />
					should I hold<br />
					that there is a mental balance<br />
					without thought directed and sustained,<br />
					or that there is a ceasing of thought directed and sustained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br />
					looking around on his company, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have you look, sirs,<br />
					how crooked is this housefather,<br />
					how crafty,<br />
					how counterfeiting is this housefather Citta!"</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, indeed, sir, we understand your saying:<br />
					'I would have ye look, sirs,<br />
					how straight is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how guileless,<br />
					how honest is this housefather Citta.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And now indeed we understand your saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would have ye look, sirs,<br />
					how crooked is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how crafty,<br />
					how dishonest is this housefather Citta.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, your first assertion was true,<br />
					your last was false.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your last was true,<br />
					your first was false.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now here, sir,<br />
					these ten reasonable questions<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you know the way to <a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> reply to them,<br />
					you should give me a counter-blow<br />
					along with your company.</p>

					<p class="f4">One question,<br />
					one explanation,<br />
					one answer.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Two questions,<br />
					two explanations,<br />
					two answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Three questions,<br />
					three explanations,<br />
					three answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four questions,<br />
					four explanations,<br />
					four answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five questions,<br />
					five explanations,<br />
					five answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Six questions,<br />
					six explanations,<br />
					six answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seven questions,<br />
					seven explanations,<br />
					seven answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight questions,<br />
					eight explanations,<br />
					eight answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nine questions,<br />
					nine explanations,<br />
					nine answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ten questions,<br />
					ten explanations,<br />
					ten answers."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather,<br />
					getting no reply to these ten reasonable questions,<br />
					rose up from his seat and went away.</p>
