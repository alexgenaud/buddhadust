					<p class="f4">Now Citta, the housefather, heard it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, has come to Macchikasaṇḍa together with a great company of the Nigaṇṭhas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So Citta, the housefather, with a number of followers, went to visit the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭa's Son,<br />
					and on coming to him greeted him in friendly wise,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son, said to Citta, the housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Hast thou faith, housefather,<br />
					in the teaching of Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					that there is a mental balance<br />
					without thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that there is a ceasing<br />
					of thought directed and sustained?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, sir, I do not walk with faith in the teaching<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					that there is a mental balance<br />
					without thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that there is a ceasing<br />
					of thought directed and sustained.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br />
					looking round<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> on his own company, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would have you look, sirs,<br />
					how straight is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how guileless<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how ingenuous is this housefather Citta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, he who should think there can be any ceasing of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					might think the mind could be caught in a net,<br />
					or that Gangā's stream<br />
					could be held back with his own fist!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what think you sir?<br />
					Which is the more excellent,<br />
					knowledge or faith?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, housefather,<br />
					knowledge is more excellent than faith.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Now I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					aloof from lusts,<br />
					aloof from states that are evil,<br />
					can enter upon the first trance,<br />
					which is joined with thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of solitude,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and can abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained<br />
					... can enter on the second trance and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, if I so desire,<br />
					by abandoning ease<br />
					... can enter on the fourth trance and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus knowing, sir,<br />
					thus seeing,<br />
					believing what other recluse or brahmin,<br />
					should I hold<br />
					that there is a mental balance<br />
					without thought directed and sustained,<br />
					or that there is a ceasing of thought directed and sustained?'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha, Nāta's Son,<br />
					looking around on his company, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would have you look, sirs,<br />
					how crooked is this housefather,<br />
					how crafty,<br />
					how counterfeiting is this housefather Citta!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, indeed, sir, we understand your saying:<br />
					"I would have ye look, sirs,<br />
					how straight is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how guileless,<br />
					how honest is this housefather Citta."</p>

					<p class="f4">And now indeed we understand your saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have ye look, sirs,<br />
					how crooked is this housefather Citta,<br />
					how crafty,<br />
					how dishonest is this housefather Citta."</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, your first assertion was true,<br />
					your last was false.<br />
					And if your last was true,<br />
					your first was false.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now here, sir,<br />
					these ten reasonable questions<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you know the way to <a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> reply to them,<br />
					you should give me a counter-blow<br />
					along with your company.</p>

					<p class="f4">One question,<br />
					one explanation,<br />
					one answer.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Two questions,<br />
					two explanations,<br />
					two answers.<br />
					Three<br />
					Four<br />
					Five<br />
					Six<br />
					Seven<br />
					Eight<br />
					Nine<br />
					Ten questions,<br />
					ten explanations,<br />
					ten answers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather,<br />
					getting no reply to these ten reasonable questions,<br />
					rose up from his seat and went away.</p>
