					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Jockey,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the head trainer, came to see the Exalted One<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side, Jockey, the head trainer,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were cavelry-men:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'A cavelry-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, head trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time Jockey, the head trainer,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were cavelry-men:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A cavelry-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, head trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time Jockey, the head trainer,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were cavelry-men:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A cavelry-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"True it is, head trainer, that I do not admit your question, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, head trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will expound it to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of a cavelry-man<br />
					who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					he must previously have had this low,<br />
					mean,<br />
					perverse idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let those beings be tortured,<br />
					be bound,<br />
					be destroyed,<br />
					be exterminated,<br />
					so that they may be thought never to have existed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, so exerting himself,<br />
					so putting forth effort,<br />
					other men torture him<br />
					and make an end of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the Purgatory of Quarrels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now if his view was this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A cavelry-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight,'</p>

					<p class="f4">- then I say that view of his is perverted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, head trainer, I declare<br />
					that for one who is guilty of perverted view<br />
					one of two paths is open,<br />
					either purgatory<br />
					or rebirth as an animal."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Jockey, the head trainer,<br />
					cried aloud<br />
					and burst into tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One: -]</p>

					<p class="f4">"That was why I disallowed your question,<br />
					head trainer,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, head trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, I am not lamenting for that,<br />
					but at the thought that<br />
					for many a long day<br />
					I have been cheated,<br />
					deceived<br />
					and led astray<br />
					in the past by teacher after teacher,<br />
					cavelry-men,<br />
					in the belief that any cavelry-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br />
					as a lay disciple,<br />
					as one who hath gone to him for refuge,<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life doth last."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward abridges this entire sutta. I have followed the example of <a href="sn04.42.003.wood.pts.htm">§3 above,</a> but have used 'cavalry-man' in place of what, following Woodward's pattern, would have been 'jockey'. It looks like Woodward did not pick up on the idea that this and the previous sutta were all about warriors.</p>
