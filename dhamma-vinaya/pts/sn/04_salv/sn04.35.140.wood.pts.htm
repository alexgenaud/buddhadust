					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas at Devadaha,<br />
					a township of the Sakkas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye, Brethren, is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever condition,<br />
					whatever cause there be<br />
					for the appearance of the eye,<br />

					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
