					as they really are,<br />
					both the arising<br />

					<p class="f4">He knows</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is body,<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, are sensual pleasures<br />
					seen by a brother,<br />
					in such a way that,<br />
					so seeing sensual pleasures,<br />
					that love of sensual pleasures<br />
					that is therein<br />
					does not fasten on him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, there were a pit of charcoal,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					deeper than a man's height,<br />
					full of charcoal,<br />
					without flame<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and smokeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose a man should come,<br />
					fond of life,<br />
					not loving death,<br />
					but loathing pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then two strong men lay hold of him,<br />
					one by each arm,<br />
					and drag him to the pit of charcoal.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would writhe his body to and fro.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, a brother sees sensual pleasures<br />

					and, so seeing,<br />
					that love of sensual pleasures,<br />

					<p class="f4">Above him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever he advances or retreats,<br />
					he has the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May no thorns pierce me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, whatsoever object in the world<br />
					is dear and delightful, -<br />
