					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, when a brother knows,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					the arising<br />
					and the destruction<br />
					of all states of ill,<br />
					then indeed sensual pleasures are seen by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he sees sensual pleasures,<br />

					for sensual pleasures,<br />
					which is therein,<br />
					does not fasten on him.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">His path abroad<br />
					and his lodging at home<br />
					are so practised<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> that,<br />
					in such a way of life,<br />
					coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil,<br />
					unprofitable states,<br />
					do not fasten on him.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother know,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					both the arising<br />
					and the destruction<br />
					of all states of ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is body,<br />
					such the arising of body,<br />
					such is the destruction of body;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling,<br />
					such the arising of feeling,<br />
					such is the destruction of feeling;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is perception,<br />
					such the arising of perception,<br />
					such is the destruction of perception;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the activities,<br />
					such the arising of the activities,<br />
					such is the destruction of the activities;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness,<br />
					such the arising of the consciousness,<br />
					such is the destruction of the consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Brethren, is how he knows,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					both the arising<br />
					and the destruction<br />
					of all states of ill.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, are sensual pleasures<br />
					seen by a brother,<br />
					in such a way that,<br />
					so seeing sensual pleasures,<br />
					that love of sensual pleasures<br />
					that is therein<br />
					does not fasten on him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, there were a pit of charcoal,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					deeper than a man's height,<br />
					full of charcoal,<br />
					without flame<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and smokeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose a man should come,<br />
					fond of life,<br />
					not loving death,<br />
					but loathing pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then two strong men lay hold of him,<br />
					one by each arm,<br />
					and drag him to the pit of charcoal.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would writhe his body to and fro.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> That man, Brethren, would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall fall into this pit of charcoal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that I shall come by death or mortal pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, a brother sees sensual pleasures<br />
					in the likeness of a pit of charcoal,<br />
					and, so seeing,<br />
					that love of sensual pleasures,<br />
					that infatuation,<br />
					that feverish longing<br />
					for sensual pleasures<br />
					that is therein<br />
					does not fasten on him.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, does a brother<br />
					so practise his path abroad<br />
					and his lodging at home<br />
					that, so practising,<br />
					so dwelling,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					do not fasten on him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, a man should enter<br />
					a forest full of thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the east of him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the west of him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the north of him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the south of him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Below him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Above him are thorns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever he advances or retreats,<br />
					he has the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May no thorns pierce me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, Brethren, whatsoever object in the world<br />
					is dear and delightful, -<br />
					that in the Ariyan discipline<br />
					is called 'the thorn.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By so understanding,<br />
					restraint and non-restraint<br />
					are to be understood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, comes non-restraint?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother,<br />
					seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					is attached to objects that are dear,<br />
					is averse from objects that displease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with attention to body distracted,<br />
					and his thought is mean.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows not that emancipation of heart,<br />
					that emancipation of wisdom,<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					whereby those evil,<br />
					unprofitable states<br />
					that have arisen<br />
					come to cease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, comes restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that brother, Brethren, so practising,<br />

					but quickly he abandons (such a state),<br />
					puts it away,<br />
					wipes it out,<br />
					makes it go to utter destruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, Brethren,<br />
					a man should let fall two<br />

					that mere trickle of water-drops<br />
					is soon wiped out,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so in that brother,<br />
					so dwelling,<br />

					<p class="f4">The arising of mindfulness in him is weak,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus if a brother practise his path abroad<br />

					in such a way of life,<br />
					that coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					do not overwhelm him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose the rajah's royal ministers<br />
					or friends<br />
					or boon companions<br />
					or kinsmen<br />
					or blood-relations<br />
					should bring and offer<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> wealth<br />
					to a brother so practising and living,<br />
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good man!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should these yellow robes torment you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Come! Return to the lower life,<br />
					enjoy possessions<br />
					and do deeds of merit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Brethren, for that brother so practising,<br />
					so living,<br />
					to reject the training<br />
					and return to the lower life<br />
					is an impossible thing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg124"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span></a> Suppose, Brethren, the river Ganges,<br />

					inclines<br />
					and leads towards the east,<br />

					armed with pick and basket saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will make this river Ganges<br />

					<p class="f4">what think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that great crowd of folk<br />
					make the river Ganges<br />
					so slope,<br />
					incline<br />
					and lead towards the west?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And why not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, lord, as the river Ganges<br />

					it were no easy thing to make it<br />

					<p class="f4">"Just so, Brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">for that brother to return to the lower life<br />
					is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Brethren, as that brother's heart<br />
					has for many a long day<br />
					been bent on detachment,<br />
					inclined to detachment,<br />
					turned towards detachment,<br />
					there is no possibility<br />
