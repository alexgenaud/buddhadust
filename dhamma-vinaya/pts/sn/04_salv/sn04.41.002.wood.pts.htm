					<p class="f4">Once a number of elder<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/citto_gahapati.htm">Citta, the housefather,</a> went to visit those elder Brethren,<br />
					and on coming to them<br />
					saluted them<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Citta, the housefather, said to those elder brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the housefather,<br />
					understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br />
					rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the elder brethren by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br />
					robed themselves at early dawn,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					went to the dwelling of Citta, the housefather,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on seats prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather, came to those elder Brethren,<br />
					and saluting them<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the housefather,<br />
					said to the venerable (chief) elder: -<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"They say, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br />
					diversity of elements.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far was diversity of elements<br />
					spoken of by the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time did Citta, the housefather,<br />
					say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br />
					diversity of elements.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far was diversity of elements<br />
					spoken of by the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time,<br />
					at these words<br />
					the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time did Citta, the housefather,<br />
					say to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br />
					diversity of elements.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, how far was diversity of elements<br />

					<p class="f4">And a third time,<br />
					at these words<br />
					the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Isidatta<br />
					was the junior of all<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> that order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta<br />
					said to the venerable chief elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> "My lord, may I reply<br />
					to this question of Citta, the housefather?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you reply, Isidatta,<br />
					to the question of Citta, the housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Then said the venerable Isidatta]:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"You question thus, do you not, housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Diversity of elements,<br />
					diversity of elements'<br />
					is the saying';</p>

					<p class="f4">and you ask:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How far was diversity of elements<br />
					spoken of by the Exalted One?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, housefather, this was said<br />
					of diversity of elements<br />
					by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The element of eye,<br />
					the element of body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the element of eye-consciousness,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The element of ear,<br />
					the element of sounds,<br />
					the element of ear-consciousness,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of nose,<br />
					the element of scents,<br />
					the element of nose-consciousness,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of tongue,<br />
					the element of savours,<br />
					the element of tongue-consciousness,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of body,<br />
					the element of tangibles,<br />
					the element of body-consciousness,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of mind,<br />
					the element of mind-states,<br />
					the element of mind-consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far, housefather,<br />
					did the Exalted One speak<br />
					of the diversity of elements."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the housefather, was glad<br />
					of what was said by the venerable Isidatta<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with his own hand<br />
					he served and satisfied those elder brethren<br />
					with food both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder Brethren,<br />
					having eaten their fill,<br />
					withdrew their hands from their bowls,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					rose up<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable chief elder<br />
					said to the venerable Isidatta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for you, friend,<br />
					that this question arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">This question did not occur to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, friend Isidatta,<br />
					if on another occasion such a question arises,<br />
					do you reply in like manner."</p>
