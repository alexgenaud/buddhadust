<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 6. The Venerable Sāriputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika other reasons that the Buddhas has not made asertions concerning the existence of one who has attained the goal is that these questions do not arise for one who has abandoned delight in body, sense-experience, own-making and consciousness; or for one who has abandoned delight in becoming; or for one who has abandoned delight in thirst. He then aserts that there is no reason more encompassing for not making such asertions than that such do not occur for one who has abandoned thirst." />
