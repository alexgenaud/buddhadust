					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> The Pali begins "There then ..." which would indicate by reference to the previous sutta which in the text has a similar nidana, that this sutta was delevered in Rājagaha, the location of the sutta prior to that one. But the previous sutta was, according to <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p145">MN 145</a> actually delivered in Sāvatthi, so I take it that this "There..." indicates Sāvatthi, not Rājagaha.</p>
