					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One addressed the Brethren, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, a brother should meet his end<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					collected and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is one collected?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, a brother dwells,<br />
					as regards body,<br />
					contemplating body as transient,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					composed<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Brethren, is a brother composed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Brethren, in his going forth<br />
					and in his returning<br />
					a brother acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In looking in front<br />
					and looking behind,<br />
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In bending or relaxing (his limbs)<br />
					he acts composedly.</p>

					<p class="f4">In wearing his robe<br />
					and bearing outer robe and bowl,<br />
					in eating,<br />
					drinking,<br />
					chewing,<br />
					and tasting<br />

					<p class="f4">In easing himself,<br />
					in going,<br />
					standing,<br />
					sitting,<br />
					sleeping,<br />
					waking,<br />
					in speaking<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, Brethren, is a brother composed.</p>
					<p class="f4">Brethren, a brother should meet his end collected and composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, as that brother dwells collected,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus he dwells contemplating impermanence<br />

					feeling that is painful,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now that is owing to something,<br />

					<p class="f4">Owing to what?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, as that brother dwells collected,<br />
					composed,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					there arises in him<br />
					feeling that is neutral,<br />
					and he thus understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is arisen in me<br />
					this neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that is owing to something,<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a pleasant feeling he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Brethren, because of oil<br />
