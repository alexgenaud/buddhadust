					<p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/citto_gahapati.htm">Citta, the housefather,</a> went to visit those elder Brethren,<br />
					and on coming to them<br />
					saluted them<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Citta, the housefather, said to those elder brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my lords the elders accept of me tomorrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder brethren accepted by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg194"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span></a> Thereupon Citta, the housefather,<br />
					understanding the acceptance of those elder Brethren,<br />
					rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the elder brethren by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the elder Brethren, when the night was gone,<br />
					robed themselves at early dawn,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					went to the dwelling of Citta, the housefather,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on seats prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta, the housefather, came to those elder Brethren,<br />
					and saluting them<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the housefather,<br />
					said to the venerable (chief) elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br />

					<p class="f4">Owing to the nonexistence of what<br />
					do these views not prevail?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					the venerable chief elder was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time did Citta, the housefather,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time did Citta, the housefather,<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Isidatta<br />
					was the junior of all that order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta<br />
					said to the venerable chief elder: -</p>

					<p class="f4">My lord, may I reply<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do you reply, Isidatta,<br />
					to the question of Citta, the housefather."

					[Then said the venerable Isidatta]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefather, your question was this, was it not?</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these divers views<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefather,<br />
					as to those divers views<br />

					<p class="f4">it is owing to the person-pack view<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> that <a id="pg195"><span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span></a> they arise,<br />

					they do not exist."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, how comes the person-pack view to be?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, housefather, the untaught manyfolk,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who discern not those who are Ariyans,<br />

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is how the person-pack view arises."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, how is there no person-pack view?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, housefather, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br />
					who discerns those who are Ariyans,<br />
					who is skilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br />
					who is trained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br />
					who discerns those who are worthy ones,<br />
					who is skilled in the worthy doctrine,<br />
					well trained in the worthy doctrine, -</p>

					<p class="f4">such regards not body as the self,<br />
					regards not the self as having body,<br />
					nor body as being in the self,<br />
					nor the self as being in body.</p>
					<p class="f4">He regards not feeling as the self -<br />

					he regards not consciousness as having body,<br />

					nor the self as being in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how, housefather, there is no person-pack view."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whence comes the worthy Isidatta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> my lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I come from Avanti,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there is at Avanti<br />
					a clansman named Isidatta,<br />
					an <a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> unseen friend of ours,<br />
					who has gone forth (from the household life).</p>

					<p class="f4">Has your reverence seen him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray where, lord, does that venerable one now dwell?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the venerable Isidatta was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is youx reverence the worthy<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> Isidatta?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then may the worthy Isidatta take his pleasure at Macchikasaṇḍa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lovely is Wild Mango Grove!</p>

					<p class="f4">I will do my best to supply the worthy Isidatta<br />
					with the requisites of robes<br />
					and alms<br />
					and lodging,<br />
					of comforts<br />
					and medicines in time of sickness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is kindly said, housefather."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Citta, the housefather, was glad<br />
					of what was said by the venerable Isidatta<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with his own hand<br />
					he served and satisfied those elder brethren<br />
					with food both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those elder Brethren,<br />
					having eaten their fill,<br />
					withdrew their hands from their bowls,<br />
					rose up<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable chief elder<br />
					said to the venerable Isidatta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for you, friend,<br />
					that this question arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">This question did not occur to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, friend Isidatta,<br />
					if on another occasion such a question arises,<br />
					do vriu reply in like manner."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Isidatta,<br />
					having set his lodging in order,<br />
					took bowl and outer robe<br />
					and departed from Macchikasaṇḍa,<br />
					and in thus departing from Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					he was gone for good<br />
					and came not back any more.</p>
