<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §36: Vedana-samyutta, Sutta 20. The Buddha explains that he has taught an understanding of sense experience in multiple ways each of which is complimentary, not contradictory with the others. He then teaches his understanding of pleasure by describing a progression from gross sensual pleasures to the sublime pleasure of the ending of perception and sense experience." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are two feelings, brethren,<br />
					in mv way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also three feelings, brethren,<br />
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also five feelings, brethren,<br />
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also six feelings, brethren,<br />
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also eighteen feelings, brethren,<br />
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also thirty-six feelings, brethren,<br />
					in my way of explaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are also one hundred and eight feelings in mv way of explaining, brethren.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the exposition of the Norm taught by me, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though I have thus expounded my method of teaching the Norm, brethren,<br />
					of those who will not approve of,<br />
					will not agree with,<br />
					each other's exposition of it,<br />
					however well said and spoken, -<br />
					of such you may expect this:</p>

					<p class="f4">They will dwell quarrelsome,<br />
					wrangling,<br />
					disputatious,<br />
					wounding each other with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now such is the method of the Norm,<br />
					as expounded by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I have so expounded it,<br />
					those who approve of,<br />
					agree with,<br />
					each other's exposition of it,<br />
					being well said andspoken, -<br />
					of such you may expect this:</p>

					<p class="f4">They will dwell in harmony,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					without quarrelling,<br />
					like milk and water mixed,<br />
					looking on one another<br />
					with the eye of affection.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these five sensual elements, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Objects cognizable by the eve,<br />
					desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognizable by the ear,<br />
					desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Scents cognizable by the nose,<br />
					desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Savours cognizable by the tongue,<br />
					desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tangibles cognizable by the body,<br />
					desirable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and dear,<br />
					passion-fraught,<br />
					inciting to lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are the five sensual elements.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That pleasure,<br />
					that happiness<br />
					that arises owing to the five sensual elements, -<br />
					that, brethren,<br />
					is called "sensual pleasure."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brethren, there may be some who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br />
					that beings experience.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br />
					I do not allow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br />
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br />
					aloof from sensua1ity,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters on the first trance,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					which is born of solitude,<br />
					easeful and zestful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is another pleasure<br />
					still more excellent<br />
					still more exquisite<br />
					than that one.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br />
					that beings can experience.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br />
					I do not allow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br />
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br />
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					enters on the inward calm,<br />
					that single-mindedness of will,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and full of ease,<br />
					which is the second trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br />
					still more excellent,<br />
					still more exquisite<br />
					than that other.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the supreme pleasure and happiness<br />
					that beings can experience.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But of that view of theirs<br />
					I do not allow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br />
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br />
					by the fading out of zest<br />
					becomes balanced<br />
					and remains mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences with the body<br />
					the happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced thoughtful man<br />
					dwells happily.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he enters on the third trance<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br />
					still more excellent,<br />
					still more exquisite<br />
					than that other.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br />
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br />
					rejecting pleasure and pain,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow<br />
					which he had before,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth trance,<br />
					which is free of pain<br />
					and free of pleasure,<br />
					but is a state of perfect purity<br />
					of balance<br />
					and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br />

					still more exquisite<br />

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, brethren, another pleasure,<br />
					still more excellent and exquisite than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, a brother,<br />
					passing utterly beyond the perception of objects,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of perception of resistance,<br />
					by not attending to perception of diversity,<br />
					with the idea of<br />
					'infinite is space,'<br />
					attains<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the realm of the infinity of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is a pleasure<br />

					<p class="f4">There may be some, brethren, who aver:</p>

					(a state which is)<br />
					the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren,<br />
					is a pleasure<br />
					still more excellent,<br />
					still more exquisite<br />
					(than that other).</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren,<br />
					there is a possibility<br />

					<p class="f4">The Wanderers who hold other views, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Friends, the Exalted One did not proclaim that<br />
					as pleasure in connection with just pleasant feeling:<br />
					but wheresoever, friends, pleasure is obtained,<br />
					the Exalted One proclaims just that pleasure,<br />
					howsoever<br />
					and of whatsoever nature,<br />
					as pleasure.'"</p>
