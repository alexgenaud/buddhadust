					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Ghosita came to see the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him in friendly wise,<br />

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side he said this to the venerable Ānanda:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Diversity in elements! Diversity in elements!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is the saying, my lord Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward abridges indicating he would use 'objects' for each of the objects of sense, but this is likely just an oversight (resulting, I would say, from the use of 'objects' for the object of the eye sense where 'shape' is the better and usual translation for <i>'rūpa'</i>). The Pali and all his previous translations have named the objects of sense in accordance with the sense organ. The usual manner of abridgment is to give the first (and sometimes the second) in a series complete, abridge the middle with the briefest possible indication of what belongs there and give the final item completely. Here, in concluding, Woodward has used 'objects' for his usual 'mind-states'. The Pali has 'dhamma'. I have followed his usual translation.</p>
