					<p class="f4">Once a number of elder brethren were staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion, as this number of elder Brethren,<br />
					after going their rounds<br />
					and eating their meal,<br />
					were sitting together in conclave at the pavilion,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the following chance talk arose: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Fetters and things that tend to fetter, friend, -<br />
					are these two things different in spirit<br />
					and in letter,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or are-they one and the same spirit,<br />
					but different in letter?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the matter was expounded<br />
					by divers brethren<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br />
					both of them are different in spirit<br />
					and different in letter."</p>

					<p class="f4">While others expounded the matter thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br />
					both of these are one and the same in spirit,<br />
					but different in letter." -</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Citta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the housefather,<br />
					had arrived at Migapathaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Citta, the <a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> housefather, heard it said<br />
					that a number of elder Brethren,<br />
					after going their rounds<br />
					and eating their meal,<br />
					were sitting together in conclave at the pavilion,<br />
					and that the following chance talk had arisen: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Fetters and things that tend to fetter, friend, -<br />
					are these two things different in spirit<br />
					and in letter,<br />
					or are-they one and the same spirit,<br />
					but different in letter?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And that thereupon the matter was expounded<br />
					by divers brethren<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br />
					both of them are different in spirit<br />
					and different in letter."</p>

					<p class="f4">While others expounded the matter thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br />
					both of these are one and the same in spirit,<br />
					but different in letter." -</p>

					<p class="f4">So Citta, the housefather, went to visit those elder Brethren,<br />
					and on coming to them<br />
					he saluted them<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta the housefather said to those elder brethren: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I heard, my lords, the rumour<br />
					that a number of elder brethren,<br />
					after going their rounds<br />
					and eating their meal,<br />
					were sitting together in conclave at the pavilion,<br />
					and that the following chance talk had arisen: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetters and things that tend to fetter, friend, -<br />
					are these two things different in spirit<br />
					and in letter,<br />
					or are-they one and the same spirit,<br />
					but different in letter?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And that thereupon the matter was expounded<br />
					by divers brethren<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br />
					both of them are different in spirit<br />
					and different in letter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">While others expounded the matter thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, a fetter and things that tend to fetter, -<br />
					both of these are one and the same in spirit,<br />
					but different in letter.' -</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is so, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, my lords, these two things,<br />
					the fetter<br />
					and the things that tend to fetter,<br />
					are different both in spirit<br />
					and in letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, my lords, I will make you a comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe some wise ones here will know the meaning of what I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, my lords, a black steer<br />
					and a white steer<br />
					are yoked together<br />
					by one rope<br />
					or one yoke.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now he who should say<br />
					that the black steer is the fetter to the white one,<br />
					or the white one to the black one, -<br />
					would he in so saying<br />
					be saying rightly?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, housefather.</p>

					<p class="f4">The black steer is not a fetter to the white one,<br />
					nor is the white one a fetter to the black one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the fact of their being yoked<br />
					by one rope<br />
					or yoke, -<br />
					that is a fetter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, my lords, just so<br />
					the eye is not a fetter of objects,<br />
					nor objects a fetter to the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to the pair of them, -<br />
					that is the fetter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear is not a fetter to sounds,<br />
					nor sounds a fetter to the ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to the pair of them, -<br />
					that is the fetter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose is not a fetter to scents,<br />
					nor scents a fetter to the nose.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to the pair of them, -<br />
					that is the fetter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue is not a fetter to savours,<br />
					nor savours a fetter to the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to the pair of them, -<br />
					that is the fetter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is not a fetter to tangibles,<br />
					nor tangibles a fetter to the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to the pair of them, -<br />
					that is the fetter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind is not a fetter to mind-states,<br />
					nor mind-states a fetter to the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the desire and lust that arise<br />
					owing to the pair of them, -<br />
					that is the fetter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good for you, housefather.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten for you, housefather,<br />
					that in you the eye of wisdom<br />
					is conversant with<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the profound teaching of the Enlightened One."</p>
