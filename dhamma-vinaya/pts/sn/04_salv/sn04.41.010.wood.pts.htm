					<p class="f4">Now at that time Citta, the housefather, was sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of devas that dwell in gardens,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					forest<br />
					and trees,<br />
					devas that dwell in healing herbs<br />
					and forest trees,<br />
					gathered and came together<br />
					and said to Citta, the housefather: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Aspire thus, housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In future time may I be a rajah,<br />
					a world-ruler.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Citta, the housefather, replied to those devas that dwell in gardens,<br />
					forest<br />
					and trees,<br />
					devas that dwell in healing herbs<br />
					and forest trees:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is a thing impermanent,<br />
					that is a thing unstable,<br />
					that must pass<br />
					and be left behind."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					the comrades and blood-relations of Citta, the housefather,<br />
					said to him: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Set up mindfulness, good master!</p>

					<p class="f4">Talk not at random."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> "What have I said<br />
					that makes you tell me<br />
					to set up mindfulness<br />
					and talk not at random?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, good master, you said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is a thing impermanent,<br />
					that is a thing unstable,<br />
					that must pass<br />
					and be left behind.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, but I said that<br />
					to the devas that dwell in gardens,<br />
					forest<br />
					and trees,<br />
					devas that dwell in healing herbs<br />
					and forest trees, who said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aspire thus, housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In future time may I be a rajah,<br />
					a world-ruler."'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What significance, housefather,<br />
					did the devas that dwell in gardens,<br />
					forest<br />
					and trees,<br />
					devas that dwell in healing herbs<br />
					and forest trees see,<br />
					so as to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aspire thus, housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In future time may I be a rajah,<br />
					a world-ruler."'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those devas that dwell in gardens,<br />
					forest<br />
					and trees,<br />
					devas that dwell in healing herbs<br />
					and forest trees<br />
					thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Citta, the housefather,<br />
					is a virtuous man,<br />
					of a lovely nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he aspire to be in future time a rajah,<br />
					a world-ruler,<br />
					the righteous aspiration of the heart,<br />
					righteous in its very purity,<br />
					will prove a blessing to the virtuous man,<br />
					will bring forth righteous fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing such significance<br />
					did those  that dwell in gardens,<br />
					forest<br />
					and trees,<br />
					devas that dwell in healing herbs<br />
					and forest trees say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Aspire thus, housefather:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In future time may I be a rajah,<br />
					a world-ruler."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is a thing impermanent,<br />
					that is a thing unstable,<br />
					that must pass<br />
					and be left behind.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, good master, do you instruct us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Possessed of faith unfaltering in the Buddha will we be,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Tis he,<br />
					that Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					world knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of faith unfaltering in the Norm<br />
					will we be,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br />
					a thing to be seen in this very life,<br />
					not a thing of time,<br />
					inviting to come and see,<br />
					leading onward,<br />
					to be realized by them that are wise,<br />
					each for himself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed will we be of faith unfaltering in the Order,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Walking righteously<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br />
					walking in the right way<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br />
					walking dutifully<br />
					is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br />
					to wit,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight sorts of men, <a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a><br />
					that is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br />
					worthy of honour,<br />
					worthy of respect,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy to be saluted with uplifted palms,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever worthy offering there be in our clan,<br />
					all that shall be imparted without favour<br />
					to righteous ones<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that are of lovely nature."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus must ye train yourselves."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, when he had inclined the hearts<br />
					of his comrades and blood-relations<br />
					towards the Buddha,<br />
					the Norm<br />
					and the Order,<br />
					when he had established them<br />
					in giving up, Citta,<br />
					the housefather, made an end.</p>
