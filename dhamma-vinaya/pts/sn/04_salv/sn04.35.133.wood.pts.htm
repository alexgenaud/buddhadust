					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was staying at Kāmaṇḍāya,<br />
					in the mango grove of the brahmin Todeyya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a young fellow,<br />
					a resident pupil of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br />
					came to visit the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the venerable Udāyin taught,<br />
					established,<br />
					roused,<br />
					and made that lad happy with a pious talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he, being thus taught,<br />
					established,<br />
					roused<br />
					and made happy<br />
					by the pious talk of the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					went to the <a id="pg78"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span></a> brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br />
					and on coming to her said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have my lady know<br />
					that Udāyin, the recluse, is teaching a doctrine<br />
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br />
					lovely in its middle,<br />
					and lovely in its ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sets forth the righteous life,<br />
					fully perfected and purified,<br />
					both in its spirit and in its form."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, my lad,<br />
					in my name do you invite Udāyin, the recluse,<br />
					for to-morrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lady," replied the lad,<br />
					and in obedience to the lady's bidding<br />
					went back to the venerable Udāyin and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the worthy Udāyin accept a teacher's fee from us,<br />
					to-morrow's food from the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Udāyin accepted by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					when that night was past,<br />
					robed himself at early dawn,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					went to the dwelling<br />
					of the brahmin lady of the Vetahaccani clan,<br />
					and sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady served the venerable Udāyin<br />
					with choice food,<br />
					both hard and soft,<br />
					with her own hands,<br />
					until he had eaten his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when she saw<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> that the venerable Udāyin had finished<br />
					and withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br />
					she put on her sandals,<br />
					sat down on a high seat,<br />
					veiling her head,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and thus addressed the venerable Udāyin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Preach me doctrine, O recluse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A time will come for that, sister," said he,<br />
					rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br />
					that young fellow visited the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and compliments<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the venerable Udāyin taught,<br />
					established,<br />
					roused,<br />
					and made that lad happy with a pious talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time he, being thus taught,<br />
					established,<br />
					roused<br />
					and made happy<br />
					by the pious talk of the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br />
					<a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> and on coming to her said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would have my lady know<br />
					that Udāyin, the recluse, is teaching a doctrine<br />
					that is lovely in its beginning,<br />
					lovely in its middle,<br />
					and lovely in its ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sets forth the righteous life,<br />
					fully perfected and purified,<br />
					both in its spirit and in its form."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You are speaking thus, my lad,<br />
					in praise of the recluse Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">But (on the former occasion) when I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Preach me doctrine, O recluse,' he replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A time will come for that, sister,'<br />
					rose from his seat and went to his lodging."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, my lady,<br />
					you put on your sandals,<br />
					sat down on a high seat,<br />
					veiled your head<br />
					and spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Preach me doctrine, O recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now they honour the doctrine,<br />
					those worthy ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">They respect the doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well then, my lad.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you invite Udāyin, the recluse,<br />
					in my name<br />
					for to-morrow's meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, my lady," replied the lad<br />
					and in obedience to the lady's bidding<br />
					went back to the venerable Udāyin and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the worthy Udāyin accept a teacher's fee from us,<br />
					to-morrow's food from the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Udāyin accepted by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					when that night was past,<br />
					robed himself at early dawn,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					went to the dwelling<br />
					of the brahmin lady of the Vetahaccani clan,<br />
					and sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady served the venerable Udāyin<br />
					with choice food,<br />
					both hard and soft,<br />
					with her own hands,<br />
					until he had eaten his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan,<br />
					when she saw that the venerable Udāyin had finished<br />
					and removed his hand from the bowl,<br />
					put off her sandals,<br />
					sat down on a low seat,<br />
					unveiled her head<br />
					and thus addressed the venerable Udāyin: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir,<br />
					owing to the existence of what<br />
					do the Arahants point out weal and woe?</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the existence of what<br />
					do they not do so?</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is eye, sister,<br />
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When eye exists not, sister,<br />
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is ear, sister,<br />
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When ear exists not, sister,<br />
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is tongue, sister,<br />
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When tongue exists not, sister,<br />
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is body, sister,<br />
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body exists not, sister,<br />
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"When there is mind, sister,<br />
					the Arahants point out weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">When mind exists not, sister,<br />
					the Arahants do not point out weal and woe."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan<br />
					said to the venerable Udāyin: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br />
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br />
					or points out the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or holds up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that he who has eyes may see objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					has the Norm been set forth by the worthy Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Udāyin,<br />
					do go for refuge to that Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Udāyin<br />
					regard me as a lay-disciple who,<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life shall last,<br />
					has so taken refuge."</p>
