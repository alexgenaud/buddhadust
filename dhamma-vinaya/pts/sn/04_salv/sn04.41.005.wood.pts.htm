					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Kāmabhū was staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/citto_gahapati.htm">Citta, the housefather,</a> came to visit the venerable Kāmabhū,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the venerable Kāmabhū said to Citta, the housefather: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Pure-limbed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> white-canopied, one-wheeled, the car rolls on.<br />
							Lo! he that eometh: faultless, stream-cutter, bond-less he."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of this that is said in brief, housefather,<br />
					how say you the Full meaning should be regarded?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Was this said by the Exalted One, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It was, housefather."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, sir, do you wait a moment<br />
					while I look into the meaning of it."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Citta, the housefather, was silent a moment,<br />
					and then said to the venerable Kamabhū: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Pure-limbed,' sir,<br />
					is a term for the virtues.</p>

					<p class="f4">'White-canopied,' sir,<br />
					is a term for release.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'One-wheeled,' sir,<br />
					is a term for mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rolls on,' sir,<br />
					is a term for coming and going.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Car,' sir,<br />
					is a term for body,<br />
					of the four great essentials compounded,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of parents sprung,<br />
					on rice- <a id="pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a> gruel fed,<br />
					impermanent,<br />
					of a nature to be worn away,<br />
					pounded away,<br />
					broken<br />
					and scattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lust, sir, is a fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred is a fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">Illusion is a fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					these are abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br />
					made things that have ceased to be,<br />
					so that they cannot sprout again in time to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br />
					is 'faultless.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'That cometli,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> sir,<br />
					is a term for the Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Stream,' sir,<br />
					is a term for craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					this is abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br />
					made something that has ceased to be,<br />
					so that it cannot sprout again in time to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, sir, a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br />
					is called 'stream-cutter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Lust, sir, is a bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred is a bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Illusion is a bond.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br />
					these are abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like the stump of a palm-tree,<br />
					made something that has ceased to be,<br />
					so that it cannot sprout again in time to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, sir, a brother who has destroyed the āsavas<br />
					is called 'boundless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, sir, as regards what was said by the Exalted One:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Pure-limbed, white-canopied, one-wheeled, the car rolls on.<br />
							Lo! he that eometh: faultless, stream-cutter, bond-less he."</p>

					<p class="f4">thus, sir, should be understood in full<br />
					the meaning of this saying in brief."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good for you, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten for you, housefather,<br />
					that in you<br />
					the eye of wisdom is conversant<br />
					with the profound teaching of the Enlightened One!"</p>
