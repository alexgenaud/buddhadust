					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, Brethren, a tortoise,<br />
					a shell-back,<br />
					was questing for its prey<br />
					at eventide<br />
					along a river bank.</p>

					<p class="f4">A jackal also, Brethren,<br />
					was questing for its prey<br />
					at eventide<br />
					along that river bank.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, that tortoise,<br />
					that shell-back<br />
					saw from afar<br />
					that jackal<br />
					questing for its prey.</p>

					<p class="f4">So drawing its neck and four limbs<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					into its shell<br />
					it crouched down at leisure<br />
					and kept still.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the jackal,<br />
					seeing that tortoise,<br />
					the shell-back,<br />
					from afar,<br />
					came up to it,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					kept watching it<br />
					with the thought:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'As soon as the tortoise,<br />
					the shell-back,<br />
					puts out one or other of its five limbs,<br />
					I'll seize it,<br />
					crack and eat it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Brethren, as the tortoise,<br />
					the shell-back,<br />
					did not put out one or other of its five limbs,<br />
					the jackal was disgusted with the tortoise<br />
					and went away,<br />
					not having got a chance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, <i>Māra</i>,<br />
					the Evil One,<br />
					is for ever on the watch<br />
					unceasingly,<br />
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Maybe I shall get a chance<br />
					to catch one of these,<br />
					by way of eye<br />
					by way of the ear,<br />
					by way of the nose,<br />
					by way of the tongue,<br />
					by way of the body,<br />
					by way of the mind.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Brethren, do ye abide keeping watch over the doors of the faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					be not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of eye uncontrolled,<br />
					do ye apply yourselves to such control,<br />
					set a guard over the faculty of eye,<br />
					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br />
					be not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />

					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the nose smelling a scent,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with body contacting tangibles,<br />
					be is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					those evil, unprofitable states,<br />

					attain control thereof.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When with mind he cognizing a mind-state,<br />

					<p class="f4">So long, Brethren, as ye abide<br />
					keeping watch over the doors of the faculties,<br />
					<i>Māra,</i> the Evil One, will go away in disgust,<br />
					not getting a chance,<br />
					as the jackal did not get a chance<br />
					from the tortoise."</p>
