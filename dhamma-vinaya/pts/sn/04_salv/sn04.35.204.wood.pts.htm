					<p class="f4">At these words, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again I was dissatisfied<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brother, a man who had never seen a Judas tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he went to a certain man<br />
					who had seen one,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas <a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> tree is blackish,<br />
					something like a charred stump.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being,<br />
					the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, the man is not satisfied<br />
					with the answer to his question,<br />
					so he goes away to another man who had seen one<br />
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas tree is reddish,<br />
					something like a lump of flesh.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being<br />
					the Judas tree is to him as that other man sees it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Still dissatisfied<br />
					with the reply to his question,<br />
					he goes away to another man who had seen one<br />
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, my man, a Judas tree is stripped of its bark.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It has its pods burst,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					something like an acacia tree.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, the man is not satisfied<br />
					with the reply to his question,<br />
					so he goes away to see yet another man who had seen a Judas tree,<br />
					and on coming to him asked him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What sort of thing is a Judas tree, master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my man, the Judas tree is very thick-leaved.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It gives a close shade,<br />
					just like a banyan tree.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, brother, for the time being a Judas tree is to him as that other sees it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, brother, according as the insight<br />
					of those good folk<br />
					is fully purified,<br />
					in accordance with that<br />
					they give their explanation of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, brother,<br />
					the insight of these worthies<br />
					is fully purified<br />
					according to their several bents,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and they give their explanation accordingly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is even as some rajah's border-town,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> brother,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yonder he sits in the midst where the four ways meet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those twin messengers<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brother, have I made you a parable,<br />
					and for your understanding of it<br />
					this is the explanation: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'The town,' brother,<br />
					is a name for the body,<br />

					broken and scattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having six gates,' brother, -<br />
					this is a name for the personal sixfold sense-sphere.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Warden of the gates,' brother, -<br />
					this is a name for mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pair of swift messengers,' brother, -<br />

					<p class="f4">'Lord of the town,' brother,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					this is a name for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the midst,<br />

					this is a name for the four great essentials,<br />
					the elements of earth, water, fire and air.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Message of the Truth,'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> brother, -<br />
