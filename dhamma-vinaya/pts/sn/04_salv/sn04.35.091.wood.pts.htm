					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Passion, Brethren, is a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passion is an imposthume.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passion is a dart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Brethren, the Tathāgata abides passionless and unwounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Brethren, if one should so desire,<br />
					he also might abide passionless and unwounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should have no conceit<br />
					of being the eye,<br />
					in the eye,<br />
					or by way of the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should not imagine:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have eye-contact.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever weal or woe or neutral state arises, experienced through eye-contact, -<br />
