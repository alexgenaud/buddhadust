					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, Brethren, a discourse (illustrated) by fire,<br />
					a Norm-discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Brethren, is that discourse?</p>

					<p class="f4">It were a good thing, Brethren,<br />

					by the satisfaction<br />
					either of the marks<br />
					or the details (of the objects).</p>

					<p class="f4">Should one die at such a time,<br />
					there is the possibility<br />
					of his winning one of two destinies,<br />
					either Purgatory<br />
					or rebirth in the womb of an animal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing this danger, Brethren,<br />
					do I so declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">It were a good thing, Brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">For sleep, I declare,<br />
					is barren for living things.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is fruitless for living things,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is dull<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> for living things,<br />
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">For (if asleep)<br />
					one would not be applying his mind<br />

					<p class="f4">Seeing this<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> danger (of being awake), Brethren,<br />
					do I so declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that, Brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple thus reflects: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let alone searing the organ of sight<br />
					with an iron pin,<br />
					on fire,<br />
					all ablaze,<br />
					a glowing mass of flame,<br />
					what if I thus ponder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent is the eye,<br />
					impermanent are objects,<br />
					impermanent is eye-consciousness,<br />
					impermanent is eye-contact,<br />
					the weal or woe or neutral state experienced<br />
					which arises owing to eye-contact,<br />
					- that also is impermanent."'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Let alone splitting the organ of hearing<br />
					with an iron spike,<br />
					on fire,<br />
					all ablaze,<br />
					a glowing mass of flame,<br />
					what if I thus ponder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent is the ear,<br />
					impermanent are sounds,<br />
					impermanent is ear-consciousness,<br />
					impermanent is ear-contact,<br />
					the weal or woe or neutral state experienced<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Let alone piercing the organ of smell<br />
					with a sharp claw,<br />

					a glowing mass of flame,<br />
					what if I thus ponder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent is the nose,<br />

					impermanent is nose-consciousness,<br />
					impermanent is nose-contact,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Let alone splitting the organ of taste<br />

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent is the tongue,<br />

					impermanent is tongue-consciousness,<br />
					impermanent is tongue-contact,<br />
					the weal or woe or neutral state experienced<br />

					- that also is impermanent."'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Let alone searing the organ of touch<br />
					with a sword,<br />
					on fire,<br />
					all ablaze,<br />
					a glowing mass of flame,<br />
					what if I thus ponder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent is the body,<br />
					impermanent are tangibles,<br />
					impermanent is body-consciousness,<br />
					impermanent is body-contact,<br />
					the weal or woe or neutral state experienced<br />

					- that also is impermanent."'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Let alone sleeping,<br />
					let me thus ponder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent is the mind,<br />
					impermanent are mind-states,<br />
					impermanent is mind-consciousness,<br />
					impermanent is mind-contact,<br />

					which arises owing to mind-contact,<br />
					- that also is impermanent."'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the eye,<br />
					is repelled by objects,<br />
					is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by eye-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to eye-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the ear,<br />
					is repelled by sounds,<br />
					is repelled by ear-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by ear-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to ear-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the nose,<br />
					is repelled by scents,<br />
					is repelled by nose-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by nose-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to nose-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the tongue,<br />
					is repelled by savours,<br />
					is repelled by tongue-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by tongue-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to tongue-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the body,<br />
					is repelled by things tactile,<br />
					is repelled by body-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by body-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to body-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the mind,<br />
					is repelled by mind-states,<br />
					is repelled by mind-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by mind-contact,<br />
					is repelled by that weal or woe or neutral state experienced,<br />
					which arises owing to mind-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br />
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br />
					comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Brethren, is the Norm discourse (illustrated) by fire.</p>
