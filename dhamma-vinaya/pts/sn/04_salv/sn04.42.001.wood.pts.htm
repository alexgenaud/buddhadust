					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Wrathful, the headman, came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him,<br />
					he saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Wrathful, the headman, said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause,<br />
					why such and such an one<br />
					is styled 'wrathful,'<br />
					and what the reason,<br />
					what the cause<br />
					why such and such an one<br />
					is styled 'kindly'?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, headman, a certain man's<br />
					passion is not abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that<br />
					others harass him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Harassed by others<br />
					he shows vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'wrathful.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Resentment is not abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that<br />

					<p class="f4">Harassed by others<br />
					he shows vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'wrathful.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Illusion is not abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that<br />
					others harass him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Harassed by others<br />
					he shows vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'wrathful.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That, headman, is the reason,<br />
					that is the cause<br />
					why such and such an one<br />
					is styled 'wrathful.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now herein, headman, if a certain man's<br />
					passion is abandoned,<br />
					owing to that<br />
					others do not harass him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unharassed by others<br />
					he shows no vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'kindly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Resentment is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that others do not <a id="pg214"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></a> harass him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unharassed by others<br />
					he shows no vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is styled 'kindly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If illusion be abandoned,<br />
					others do not harass him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unharassed by others<br />
					he shows no vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he styled 'kindly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the reason,<br />
					that is the cause, headman,<br />
					why a certain one is styled 'kindly.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Wrathful, the headman,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point the way to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					that they who have eyes<br />
					may behold objects, -<br />
					even as in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the Exalted One, lord,<br />
					I go for refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br />
					as a lay disciple,<br />
					as one who hath gone to him for refuge,<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life doth last."</p>
