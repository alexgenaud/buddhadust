<meta name="description" content="The F. L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Salayatana Vagga, Moggallāna-Samyuttam, Sutta 10. Moggallāna visits  the Tavatimsa Realm and delivers an hypnotic spell in praise of the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha to Sakka and five hundred other devas. Sakka replies repeating the spell back to Moggallāna. Sakka then returns four more times with incresing numbers of devas. The same events are repeated with a variation on the spell." />
