Nataputta tries to disgrace the Buddha by suggesting he is doing the families disservice going on begging rounds during a time of famine. The Buddha responds by saying that charity, honesty and being perceptive is the basis for prosperity. He then points out the eight real reasons for the destruction of families." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a great company of brethren<br />
					and reached Nalanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One stayed at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nalanda</a> in Pāvārika Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Nalanda was stricken with famine,<br />
					hard to get one's living in,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					white with men's bones,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					its crops grown to mere stubs.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Nāṭa's Son, the Unclothed,<br />
					was lodging at Nalanda,<br />
					together with a great following of the Unclothed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					a follower of the Unclothed,<br />
					came to visit Nāṭa's Son, the Unclothed,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said Nāṭa's Son, the Unclothed,<br />
					to Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					as he thus sat: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, headman!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go and join issue<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> with Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					and such a goodly report of thee<br />
					shall be noised abroad,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					has joined issue with Gotama, the recluse.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, how, sir,<br />
					shall I join issue with Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					who is of such great magic power,<br />
					of such great prestige?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go thou, headman, to visit Gotama, the recluse,<br />
					and on coming to him say this: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, is it not a fact<br />
					that in divers ways<br />
					the Exalted One extols consideration for clansmen,<br />
					extols carefulness,<br />
					extols compassion for clansmen?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, headman, if Gotama, the recluse, thus questioned<br />
					replies thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, headman, <a id="pg229"><span class="f2 g"><b>[229]</b></span></a> the Tathāgata,<br />
					in divers ways<br />
					does extol consideration for clansmen,<br />
					does extol carefulness,<br />
					does extol compassion for clansmen,' -<br />
					then do you say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, lord, how is it that the Exalted One,<br />
					with a great company of Brethren,<br />
					goes about on his rounds<br />
					in a place that is stricken with famine,<br />
					a place hard to get a living in,<br />
					that is white with men's bones,<br />
					its crops grown to mere stubs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the Exalted One is acting<br />
					for the destruction of the clansmen,<br />
					for the loss of the clansmen,<br />
					is acting to the injury of the clansmen<br />
					in so doing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned by you, headman,<br />
					with a two-horned question,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Gotama, the recluse, will be unable<br />
					either to vomit it up<br />
					or to swallow it down."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, sir,"<br />
					said Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					in reply to Nāṭa's Son, the Unclothed,<br />
					and rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted him by the right,<br />
					and went away to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br />
					he saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					Asibandhaka's Son, the headman,<br />
					said to the Exalted One:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, is it not a fact<br />
					that in divers ways<br />
					the Exalted One extols consideration for clansmen,<br />
					extols carefulness,<br />
					extols compassion for clansmen?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, headman.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, does in divers ways<br />
					does extol consideration for clansmen,<br />
					does extol carefulness,<br />
					does extol compassion for clansmen"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, lord, how is it<br />
					that the Exalted One,<br />
					with a great company of the Brethren,<br />
					is going his rounds<br />
					in a place that is stricken with famine,<br />
					hard to get a living in,<br />
					white with men's bones,<br />
					its crops grown to mere stubs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the Exalted One in so doing<br />
					is acting for the destruction of the clansmen,<br />
					for the loss,<br />
					for the injury<br />
					of the clansmen."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Headman,<br />
					from ninety and one kalpas ago<br />
					up to now<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I do not remember,<br />
					I am not conscious of ever<br />
					having wronged a clan<br />
					to the extent even of a cooked meal<br />
					given in offering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those clans were rich,<br />
					very rich,<br />
					of exceeding great wealth, <a id="pg230"><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></a><br />
					abounding in gold and silver,<br />
					abounding in sources of wealth,<br />
					abounding in wealth of crops.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that wealth was amassed through charity,<br />
					amassed through truthfulness,<br />
					amassed through self-restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are eight reasons, headman,<br />
					there are eight causes<br />
					for the injury of clans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clans meet with injury from rājahs,<br />
					from robbers,<br />
					from fire,<br />
					from water,<br />
					they find not treasure that is hidden,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					through sloth they abandon toil,<br />
					or else in the clan arises a wastrel<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> who scatters,<br />
					destroys<br />
					and breaks up its wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The impermanence of things<br />
					is the eighth cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, headman, are the eight reasons,<br />
					the eight causes<br />
					for the injury of clans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, headman, since these eight reasons,<br />
					these eight causes<br />
					exist<br />
					and are found to be,<br />
					he who should say thus of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One acts for the destruction,<br />
					for the loss,<br />
					for the injury<br />
					of the clans,' -<br />
					if he abandon not that saying,<br />
					if he abandon not that thought,<br />
					if he give not up adherence to that view,<br />
					he is cast into Purgatory sure enough."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Asibandhaka's Son<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br />
					as a lay disciple,<br />
					as one who hath gone to him for refuge,<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life doth last."</p>
