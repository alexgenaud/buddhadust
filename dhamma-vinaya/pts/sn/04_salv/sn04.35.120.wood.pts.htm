					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to visit the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">After the exchange of greetings and friendly courtesies<br />
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					that brother thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, my fellow-lodger<br />
					has renounced the training<br />
					and gone back to the lower life."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"So it happens, friend,<br />
					with one the door of whose faculties is unguarded,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who is immoderate in eating,<br />
					and not given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That brother, friend,<br />
					is of such a nature.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>There is apparent confusion here as to how this should be read. It can be heard as 'This particular bhikkhu, so long as he lives will find it impossible...' or 'So living, a bhikkhu, will find it impossible ...' The former would be a more forceful lesson to the bhikkhu being addressed; the latter a more accessible lesson for later hearers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friend, is one given to watchfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, friend, by day<br />

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br />
					lying on his right side<br />
					he takes up the lion-posture,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					resting one foot on the other,<br />
					and thus collected and composed<br />
					fixes his thought on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br />
					at early dawn,<br />
					he walks up and down,<br />
					and then sits,<br />
					and so cleanses his heart<br />
					from states that may hinder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, friend, is one given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, friend, thus should you train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will be watchful over our faculties,<br />
					moderate in eating<br />
					and given to watchfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, friend, must you train yourself."</p>
