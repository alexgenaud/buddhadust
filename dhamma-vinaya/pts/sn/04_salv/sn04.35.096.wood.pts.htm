<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 96. The Buddha describes a person as being of the nature to fall back if when he perceives a sense-object he is subject to and involved with the arising of unprofitable states; of a nature not to fall back if he rejects them when unprofitable states arise; and has found the six stations of matery when on the perception of a sense-object unprofitable states do not arise.
