<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 96. The Buddha describes a person as being of the nature to fall back if when he perceives a sense-object he is subject to and involved with the arising of unprofitable states; of a nature not to fall back if he rejects them when unprofitable states arise; and has found the six stations of matery when on the perception of a sense-object unprofitable states do not arise.

					<p class="f4">And how, brethren, is one of a nature to fall back?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, at sight of an object, evil, unprofitable states arise in a brother, memories and plans,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a brother welcomes that object, rejects it not, puts it not away, wipes it not out, does not make it go to utter destruction, thus should a brother understand of it:<br />

					<p class="f4">Then again, brethren, on tasting a savour with the tongue ... on cognizing a mind-state with the mind, evil unprofitable states arise in a brother, memories and hopes akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a brother welcomes that state, rejects it not, puts it not away, wipes it not out, does not make it go to utter destruction, thus should he understand <span class="f3"><b>[46]</b></span> of it:<br />
					'I am falling back in profitable states.<br />
					This was called by the Exalted One "falling back."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, brethren, is one whose nature is to fall back.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, brethren, is one of a nature not to fall back?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, at sight of an object, evil, unprofitable states arise in a brother, memories and hopes akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a brother welcomes not that object, rejects it, puts it away, wipes it out, makes it go to utter destruction, thus should he understand of it:<br />
					'In profitable states I am not falling back.<br />
					This was called by the Exalted One<br />
					"not falling back."'</p>

					<p class="f4">So also on tasting a savour with the tongue ... on cognizing a mind-state with the mind ... If a brother welcomes not that state, puts it away ... thus should he understand of it:<br />
					'I am not falling back in profitable states. ...'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brethren, are the six stations of mastery?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, on seeing an object with the eye evil unprofitable states do not arise in a brother, memories and hopes akin to the fetters that bind.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such case, brethren, thus should a brother understand:<br />
					'Mastered is this sense-sphere. This was called "a station of mastery" by the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same is to be said of the tongue and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brethren, are called 'the six stations of mastery.'</p>
