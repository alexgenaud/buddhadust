					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Figliting-man,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the trainer, came to see the Exalted One<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side, Fightmg-man, the trainer,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were Hghtiug-men:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A fighting-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time Fightnig-man, the trainer,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were Hghtiug-men:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A fighting-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time <a id="pg217"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span></a> Fightnig-man, the trainer,<br />
					said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, lord, this traditional saying<br />
					of teachers of old<br />
					who were Hghtiug-men:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A fighting-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />

					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"True it is, trainer, that I do not<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> admit your question, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question."</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will expound it to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case of a fightmg-man<br />
					who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					he must previously have had this low,<br />
					mean,<br />
					perverse idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let	those	beings be tortured,<br />
					be bound,<br />
					be destroyed,<br />
					be exterminated,<br />
					so that they may be thought never to have existed."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, so exerting himself,<br />
					so putting forth effort,<br />
					other men torture him<br />
					and make an end of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the Purgatory of Quarrels.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now if his view was this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A fighting-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight,'</p>

					<p class="f4">- then I say that view of his is perverted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, trainer, I declare<br />
					that for one who is guilty of perverted view<br />
					one of two paths is open,<br />
					either purgatory<br />
					or rebirth as an animal."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Fighting-man, the trainer,<br />
					cried aloud<br />
					and burst into tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One: -]</p>

					<p class="f4">"That was why I disallowed your question,<br />
					trainer,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, trainer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me not this question.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lord, I am not lamenting for that,<br />
					but at the thought that<br />
					for many a long day<br />
					I have been cheated,<br />
					deceived<br />
					and led astray<br />
					in the past by teacher after teacher,<br />
					fighting-men,<br />
					in the belief that any fighting-man who in battle exerts himself,<br />
					puts forth effort,<br />
					thus exerting himself<br />
					and putting forth effort<br />
					is tortured<br />
					and put an end to by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when body breaks up,<br />
					after death he is reborn<br />
					in the company of the Devas of Passionate Delight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, -<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">To the exalted One, lord, I go for refuge, to the Norm and to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me<br />
					as a lay disciple,<br />
					as one who hath gone to him for refuge,<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life doth last."</p>
