					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Kāmabhū was staying at Macchikasaṇḍa<br />
					in Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/citto_gahapati.htm">Citta, the housefather,</a> came to visit the venerable <a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> Kāmabhū,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Citta, the housefather, said to the venerable Kāmabhū: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, how many activities<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> are there?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are three activities, housefather:<br />
					those of body,<br />
					those of speech<br />
					those of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what, sir, is the activity of body,<br />
					what is the activity of speech,<br />
					what is the activity of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In-breathing and out-breathing, housefather,<br />
					is the activity of body;<br />
					thought directed and sustained<br />
					is the activity of speech:<br />
					perception and feeling<br />
					are the activity of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why, sir, are in-breathing and out-breathing the activity of body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is thought directed and sustained the activity of speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why are perception and feeling the activity of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In-breathing and out-breathing, housefather,<br />
					are bodily processes,<br />
					dependent on body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore are they called<br />
					'the activity of body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">First one directs thought<br />
					and sustains it,<br />
					then one utters speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is thought directed and sustained called<br />
					'the activity of speech.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception and feeling<br />
					are mental processes<br />
					dependent on mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore are they called<br />
					'the activity of mind'."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, sir, comes the attainment<br />
					of the ceasing of perception and feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"A brother, housefather,<br />
					in attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling<br />
					does not think:<br />
					'I shall attain,<br />
					the ceasing of perception and feeling',<br />
					'I am attaining,<br />
					the ceasing of perception and feeling',<br />
					'I have attained<br />
					the ceasing of perception and feeling,'<br />
					but his mind has <a id="pg202"><span class="f2 g"><b>[202]</b></span></a> been so practised that it leads him on to the state of being such."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, in attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br />
					what states cease first?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it the activity of body<br />
					or of speech<br />
					or of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In so attaining, housefather,<br />
					a brother's activity of speech ceases first,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					then that of body,<br />
					then that of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But a brother who has so attained,<br />
					how does he differ from a dead man,<br />
					from one who bas made an end?</p>

					<p class="f4">"In a dead man, housefather,<br />
					in one who bas made an end,<br />
					the activity of body<br />
					has ceased,<br />
					become calmed<br />
					the activities of speech<br />
					has ceased,<br />
					become calmed<br />
					the activities of mind<br />
					has ceased,<br />
					become calmed<br /></p>

					<p class="f4">Life has run out,<br />
					vital heat has ceased,<br />
					the faculties are scattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, housefather, who has attained the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br />
					the activity of body<br />
					also has ceased,<br />
					become calmed<br />
					the activities of speech<br />
					also has ceased,<br />
					become calmed<br />
					the activites of mind<br />
					also has ceased,<br />
					become calmed.</p>

					<p class="f4">But his life has not run out,<br />
					vital beat has not ceased,<br />
					the faculties have become clarified.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the difference between a dead man,<br />
					one who bas made an end,<br />
					and one who has attained the ceasing of perception and feeling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how comes about the emerging<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In emerging from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling, housefather,<br />
					a brother does not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will now emerge,<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling',
					'I am emerging,<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling',<br />
					'I have now emerged from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,'<br />
					but his mind has been so practised<br />
					that it leads him on to the state of being such."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But wben a brother is thus emerging<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br />
					what states arise first?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it activity of body,<br />
					activity of speech,<br />
					or activity of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">"In a brother so emerging from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling, housefather,<br />
					activity of mind arises first,<br />
					next activity of body,<br />
					and last activity of speech."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg203"><span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span></a> "Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when a brother has so emerged<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br />
					how many contacts touch him?</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a brother has so emerged<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling, housefather,<br />
					three contacts touch him:<br />
					the void,<br />
					the signless<br />
					and the aimless contact."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when one has so emerged<br />
					from attaining the ceasing of perception and feeling,<br />
					how does a brother's mind tend,<br />
					slope,<br />
					incline?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"His mind tends to detachment,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> housefather,<br />
					it slopes to detachment,<br />
					it inclines to detachment."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, sir," said Citta, the housefather,<br />
					pleased with the venerable Kāmabhū's reply,<br />
					and welcomed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he asked a further question: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, sir, how many states<br />
					are most useful<br />
					for the attainment of the ceasing of perception and feeling?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, housefather,<br />
					you ask last<br />
					what you ought to have asked first!</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet will I explain to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Two states are most useful, housefather,<br />
					for the attainment of the ceasing of perception and feeling, -<br />
					calm and insight."</p>
