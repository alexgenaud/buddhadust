					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ṭriyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by the eye,<br />
					is repelled by objects,<br />
					is repelled by eye-consciousness,<br />
					is repelled by eye-contact,<br />

					<p class="f4">Being repelled by these,<br />
					he lusts not for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not lusting he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this freedom<br />
					comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task.</p>

					<p class="f4">For life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and those brethren were pleased<br />
					at the words of the Exalted One<br />
					and welcomed them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the teaching was thus expounded<br />
					the hearts of those thousand brethren<br />
					were utterly set free from the <i>āsavas.</i></p>
