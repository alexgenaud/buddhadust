					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> It is to be remembered that Tathāgata, is defined by the <i>Comy.</i> here and elsewhere as equivalent to <i>satta,</i> any being. The question is that common to all, 'What becomes of us after death?' not only 'What becomes of the Tathāgata, (as Buddha)?' There are many passages, however, where the Master refers to himself in this connexion. At the <i>Udāna</i> <i>Comy.,</i> p. 340, <i>Tathāgata = attā,</i> 'the self.' At <i>M.</i>  i,. 338 it = a Saint. See <i>Brethren,</i> 393, <i>n.</i> 4; <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.085.wood.pts.htm#fn5"><i>K.S.</i> iii, 95 <i>n.</i></a> Perhaps 'liberated being' is the best term for general use</p>
