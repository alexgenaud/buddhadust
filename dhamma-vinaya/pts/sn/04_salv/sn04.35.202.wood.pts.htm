<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 202. Maha Moggallāna delivers a discourse on what constitutes a leaky bhikkhu. If a bhikkhu dwells attached to the pleasures of the senses, averse to the pains of the senses then he is conquored by the senses and subject to old age, sickness and death and is a leaky bhikkhu. If he is not attached to the pleasures of the senses, averse to the pains of the senses then he is conquoror of the senses and not subject to old age, sickness and death and is not a leaky bhikkhu." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu,</a><br />
					in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time there was a newly built mote-hall<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					not long made,<br />
					never yet dwelt in<br />
					by recluse<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or any other human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					they saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					they said to the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, lord, is a newly built mote-hall<br />
					of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					not long made,<br />
					never yet dwelt in<br />
					by recluse<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or any other human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let our lord, the Exalted One,<br />
					be the first to make use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Exalted One has first made use of it,<br />
					afterwards the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it.</p>

					<p class="f4">That shall be for the profit and welfare<br />
					of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					for many a long day."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One assented by silence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					seeing the consent of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him by the right<br />
					and went away to the <a id="pg117"><span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span></a> new mote-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having got it ready in every way,<br />
					having appointed seats,<br />
					set a waterpot<br />
					and hung up an oil-lamp,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they went to the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him they said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"All ready, lord, is the mote-hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seats are appointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">A waterpot is set.</p>

					<p class="f4">An oil-lamp is hung.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One now do what seems good to him."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					and taking outer robe and bowl<br />
					went along with a great company of brethren<br />
					to the new mote-hall.</p>

						<div class="floatr 240wpx">

					<p class="f4">On reaching it<br />
					he had his feet washed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					entered the mote-hall<br />
					and sat down against the middle pillar,<br />
					facing the east.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Order of Brethren also had their feet washed,<br />
					entered the mote-hall<br />
					and sat down against the western wall,<br />
					also facing east,<br />
					with the Exalted One in front of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also,<br />
					having had their feet washed,<br />
					entered the mote-hall<br />
					and sat down against the eastern wall,<br />
					having the Exalted One in front of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One taught the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					with a pious talk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					till far into the night,<br />
					established them,<br />
					roused<br />
					and made them happy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he dismissed them with these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The night is far spent, Gotamas.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye now what seems good to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is well, lord,"<br />
					said the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					in obedience to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they rose up,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					the Exalted One said to the venerable Moggallāna the Great: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna, the Order of Brethren<br />
					is now freed of sloth <a id="pg118"><span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span></a> and torpor.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Bethink thee, Moggallāna,<br />
					of a pious talk to the Order of Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">My back is aching.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will stretch it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, lord," replied the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br />
					to the Exalted One.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 mart6">
							<p>"...on his right side." He is now facing the bhikkhus. But how was Moggallāna seated? Did he turn around to face the bhikkhus as he taught, thereby sitting with his back to the Buddha? Not likely. Perhaps far enough to the side to make turning unnecessary. And what would those bhikkhus do who were by this change now seated directly in front of the Buddha? Also a no-no. More likely in the original seating there was a gap left in the ranks of the bhikkhus so that they sat to the sides of the central piller.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One had his robe folded into four<br />
					and lay down on his right side<br />
					in the lion-posture,<br />
					putting one foot on the other,<br />
					collected and composed,<br />
					with his mind set on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Moggallāna the Great addressed the Brethren,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," replied those brethren<br />
					to the venerable Moggallāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Moggallāna the Great then said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, I will teach you the way<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> of lusting<br />
					and also of not lusting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye apply your ininds carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, friend,"<br />
					replied those brethren to the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
