					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesalī,</a> in Great Grove, at the Hall of the Gabled Home.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the venerable Anuradha<br />
					was staying not far from the Exalted One<br />
					in a forest hut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of heretical Wanderers<br />
					came to visit the venerable Anuradha,<br />
					greeted him<br />
					and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, those heretical Wanderers<br />
					said to the venerable Anuradha: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anuradha, a Tathāgata,<br />
					a superman,<br />
					one of the best of men,<br />
					a winner of the highest winning,<br />
					is proclaimed in (one of) these four ways:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, exists after death'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, does not exist after death,</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'A Tathāgata,  neither exists nor not-exists after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Upon this the venerable Anuradha said<br />
					to those heretical Wanderers: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, a Tathāgata,<br />
					a superman,<br />
					one of the best of men,<br />
					a winner of the highest gain,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anuradha,<br />
					not long after those heretical Wanderers were gone,<br />

					<p class="f4">How should I answer<br />
					in accordance with his teaching,<br />
					so that no one who agrees with his teaching<br />
					and foUows his views<br />
					might incur reproach?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anuradha<br />
					went to the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Anuradha thus addressed the Exalted One: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am staying here, lord,<br />
					in a forest hut<br />
					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a number of heretical Wanderers came to me<br />

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, Anuradha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg271"><span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span></a> "Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Anuradha, whatsoever body,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near, -<br />
					every body<br />
					should be regarded,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					by perfect insight,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever feelings<br />
					be they past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near, -<br />
					every feeling<br />
					should be regarded,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					by perfect insight,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever perception<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near, -<br />
					every perception<br />
					should be regarded,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					by perfect insight,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever activities<br />
					be they past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near, -<br />
					every activity<br />
					should be regarded,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					by perfect insight,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever consciousness<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This am not I.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, Anuradha,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					feels aversion from body,<br />
					feels aversion from feeling,<br />
					feels aversion from perception,<br />
					feels aversion from the activities,<br />
					feels aversion from consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So feeling,<br />
					he is dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">By dispassion<br />
					be is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">By freedom<br />
					comes the knowledge that he is free.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ended is birth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in such conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what say you, Anuradha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard a Tathāgata's, body<br />
					as the Tathāgata?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what say you, Anuradha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard a Tathāgata,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard a Tathāgata,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what say you, Anuradha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard a Tathāgata,<br />
					as <a id="pg272"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span></a> as having no body,<br />
					no feeling,<br />
					no perception,<br />
					no activities,<br />
					no consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Anuradha, since in just this life<br />
					a Tathāgata, is not met with in truth,<br />
					in reality,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is it proper for you to pronounce this of him:</p>
