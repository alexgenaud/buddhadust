Both the common person and the Arahant experience painful sensations, pleasant sensations and sensations that are not painful but not pleasant. The Buddha explains that the difference between the two is that the Arahant does not add to his pain by an emotional or 'follow-on' component." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One once addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br />
					feels feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					feeling that is painful<br />
					and feeling that is neutral.</p>

					<p class="f4">The well-taught Ariyan disciple, Brethren,<br />
					feels feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					feeling that is painful<br />
					and feeling that is neutral.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now herein, Brethren,<br />
					what is the distinction,<br />
					what is the specific feature,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					what is the difference<br />
					between the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the untaught manyfolk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted one as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br />
					if the meaning of this that has been spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br />
					being touched by feeling that is painful,<br />
					weeps and wails,<br />
					cries aloud,<br />
					knocks the breast,<br />
					falls into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he feels a twofold feeling,<br />
					bodily<br />
					and mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, they pierce a man with a barb,<br />
					then with a second barb,<br />
					just so, Brethren,<br />
					that man feels the pain of two barbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does the untaught manyfolk<br />
					being touched by feeling that is painful,<br />
					weep and wail,<br />
					crie aloud,<br />
					knock the breast,<br />
					fall into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he feels a twofold feeling,<br />
					bodily<br />
					and mental.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> Touched by that painful feeling<br />
					he feels repugnance for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling that repugnance for the painful feeling,<br />
					the lurking tendency to repugnance<br />
					fastens on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by the painful feeling,<br />
					he delights in pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">The untaught manyfolk, Brethren,<br />
					knows of no refuge from painful feeling<br />
					save sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting in that sensual pleasure,<br />
					the lurking tendency to sensual pleasure<br />
					fastens on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the arising<br />
					and the destruction of feelings,<br />
					nor the satisfaction,<br />
					the misery,<br />
					the way of escape from feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he understands them not,<br />
					the lurking tendency to ignorance of neutral feeling<br />
					fastens on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					he feels it as one in bondage.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is painful,<br />
					he feels it as one in bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels feeling that is neutral,<br />
					he feels it as one in bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">This untaught many-folk, Brethren, is called<br />
					'in bondage to birth,<br />
					death,<br />
					sorrow<br />
					and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is in bondage to ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple,<br />
					when touched by painful feeling,<br />
					weeps not,<br />
					wails not,<br />
					cries not aloud,<br />
					knocks not the breast,<br />
					falls not into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels but one feeling,<br />
					the bodily,<br />
					not the mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Brethren, they pierce a man with a barb,<br />
					but do not pierce him with a second barb.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that man feels<br />
					but the pain caused by the one barb.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Brethren, the well-taught Arivan disciple,<br />
					when touched by painful feeling,<br />
					weeps not,<br />
					wails not,<br />
					cries not aloud,<br />
					knocks not the breast,<br />
					falls not into utter bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels but one feeling,<br />
					bodily pain,<br />
					not mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, he has no repugnance for painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he has no repugnance for it,<br />
					the lurking tendency to repugnance for painful feeling<br />
					fastens not on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when touched by painful feeling,<br />
					delights not in sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					knows of a refuge from painful feeling<br />
					apart from sensual ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he delights not in sensual ease,<br />
					the <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> lurking tendency to sensual ease<br />
					fastens not on bim.</p>

					<p class="f4">As be understands, as they really are,<br />
					both the arising<br />
					and the destruction<br />
					of these feelings,<br />
					the satisfaction,<br />
					the misery of them,<br />
					the way of escape therefrom,<br />
					the lurking tendency to ignorance of neutral feeling<br />
					fastens not on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					he feels it as one freed from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a feeling that is painful,<br />
					he feels it as one that is freed from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a neutral feeling,<br />
					he feels it as one that is freed from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">This well-taught Axiyan disciple, Brethren,<br />
					is called<br />
					'freed from the bondage of birth,<br />
					old age,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from sorrow and grief,<br />
					from woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is freed from the bondage of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Brethren, is the distinction,<br />
					the specific feature,<br />
					the difference<br />
					between the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the untaught manyfolk.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Not swayed by feelings is the sage. Nor ease<br />
							Nor pain affecteth him of knowledge wide.<br />
							Betwixt the wise man and the worldly one<br />
							Vast is the difference in goodliness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A searcher of the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> of knowledge wide,<br />

							By undesired things he is not repelled.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">By his disinclination and dislike<br />
							They're blown away, departed, are no more.<br />
							Knowing the stainless path and sorrowless,<br />
