Venerable Assaji is suffering an illness which prevents him from attaining jhana and he is worried about falling away. The Buddha explains to him that the essence of his teaching is not the attaining of jhana, and he instructs him in such a way as to bring about Assaji's arahantship." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					in Great Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Assaji was staying in Kassapa's Park,<br />
					being sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Assaji called to his attendants, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friends!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go ye to the Exalted One, and,<br />
					in my name worshipping at the feet of the Exalted One,<br />
					say unto him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the brother Assaji is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus do ye say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well were it, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would visit brother Assaji,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br />
					replied those brethren to the venerable Assaji,<br />
					and went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					those brethren said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the brother Assaji is sick<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it if the Exalted One<br />
					would visit brother Assaji<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Assaji.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Assaji saw the Exalted One coming,<br />
					while yet he was afar off,<br />
					and on seeing him<br />
					he stirred upon his bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Assaji:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, Assaji!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed!</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these seats made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit there."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One sat down<br />
					and said to the venerable Assaji:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, Assaji, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you any doubt, Assaji?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you any remorse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, lord, I have no little doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have no little remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you not anything, Assaji,<br />
					wherein to reproach yourself as to morals?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, there is nothing wherein I reproach myself as to morals."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Assaji, if that is so,<br />
					you must have some worry,<br />
					you must have something you regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, lord, I kept trying to calm down my sickness,<br />
					but I am still much troubled<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> by my breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> cannot win balance of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But though I cannot win balance of mind,<br />
					I say to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yet I do not fall away.'"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p>Bhk.
