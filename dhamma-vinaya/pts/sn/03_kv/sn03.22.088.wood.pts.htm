					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					in Great Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Assaji<br />
					was staying in Kassapa's Park,<br />
					being sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Assaji called to his attendants, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friends!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go ye to the Exalted One, and,<br />
					in my name worshipping at the feet of the Exalted One,<br />
					say unto him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the brother Assaji is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus do ye say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well were it, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would visit brother Assaji,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br />
					replied those brethren to the venerable Assaji,<br />
					and went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					those brethren said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the brother Assaji is sick<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it if the Exalted One<br />
					would visit brother Assaji<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Assaji.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Assaji saw the Exalted One coming,<br />
					while yet he was afar off,<br />
					and on seeing him<br />
					he stirred upon his bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Assaji:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, Assaji!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed!</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these seats made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit there."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One sat down<br />
					and said to the venerable Assaji:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, Assaji, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you any doubt, Assaji?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you any remorse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, lord, I have no little doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have no little remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you not anything, Assaji,<br />
					wherein to reproach yourself as to morals?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, there is nothing<br />
					wherein I reproach myself as to morals."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Assaji, if that is so,<br />
					you must have some worry,<br />
					you must have something you regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, lord, I kept trying to calm down my sickness,<br />
					but I am still much troubled<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> by my breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> cannot win balance of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But though I cannot win balance of mind,<br />
					I say to myself:</p>
