					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the Bhaggi,<br />
					at Crocodile-Haunt<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in Bhesakala<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Grove<br />
					in the Deer-Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Nakula-pitar came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there, the housefather Nakula-pitar addressed the Exalted One, saying:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master, I am a broken-down old man,<br />
					aged, far-gone in years,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I have reached life's end,<br />
					I am sick and always ailing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Master, I am one<br />
					to whom rarely comes the sight<br />

					and the worshipful brethren.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One cheer and comfort me,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> "True it is, true it is, housefather,<br />

					<p class="f4">For one carrying this body about, housefather,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, housefather,<br />
					thus you should train yourself:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Though my body is sick,<br />
					my mind shall not be sick."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, must you train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nakula-pitar, the housefather,<br />
					welcomed and gladly heard the words of the Exalted One,<br />
					and rising from his seat<br />
					he saluted the Exalted One by the right,<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he came to the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there,<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta said to the housefather Nakula-pitar:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Calmed are your senses, housefather:<br />
					clear and pure is your complexion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Surely to-day you have had pious converse<br />
					face-to-face with the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How could it be otherwise, Master?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have just now been sprinkled with the nectar<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of pious converse by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And in what way, housefather,<br />
					were you sprinkled with the nectar<br />
					of pious converse by the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Master, I went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him, and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I sat thus, Master,<br />
					I said to the Exalted One:—</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master, I am a broken-down old man,<br />
					aged, far gone in years,<br />
					I have reached my life's end,<br />
					I am sick and always ailing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Master, I am one to whom<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, must you train yourself.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But did not it occur to you, housefather,<br />
					to question the Exalted One further?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, how far, Master,<br />
					is body sick and mind sick?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how far is body sick and mind not sick?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would travel far indeed, Master,<br />
					to learn from the lips of the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					the meaning of this saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me if the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					should think fit to expound to me<br />
					the meaning of this saying."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen, housefather;<br />
					apply your mind<br />
					and give heed to what I shall tell you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Master," said housefather Nakula-pitar,<br />
					and listened to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta thus spake:—</p>
