<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.25.2. The Buddha first lays out the doctrine of the inconstance of sights, sounds, scents, savours, touches and things (objects of the mind), and then states that anyone who moderately approves of this doctrine is called a Streamwinner by faith, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one has a certain amount of insight into this doctrine one is called one who is a Streamwinner by Dhamma, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one sees these things as they are, one is called a Streamwinner." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward translates <i>'rūpa'</i> as body, but what is being spoken of here are the objects of the senses and that would be 'visible objects' not just the body. <i>Rūpa</i> is basically 'light', and it can be said that at it's most fundamental sight is the perception of light.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> <i>'Dhammā'</i>. The term must mean an object of the mind sense (mano), not a state of the mind (citta). 'Things.' 'Phenomena.' It cannot be 'The Dhamma' as the use pre-dates the appearance of such. 'Form' is too narrow. The confusion may arise by the association with the fourth of the Satipatthanas where 'Living observing the Dhamma through The Dhamma' is described as observing the arising and passing away of several elements of The Dhamma.</p>
