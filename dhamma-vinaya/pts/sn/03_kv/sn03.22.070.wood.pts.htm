					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine,<br />
					so that hearing the doctrine of the Exalted One<br />
					I might dwell solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"For that which is inherent in what is lustful, brother,<br />
					you must put away desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I understand, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand, Well-farer!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, brother, do you understand in full<br />
					that which I said concisely?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, lord, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, lord, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, lord, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">The activites, lord, do not belong to the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, lord, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">I must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how I understand in full<br />
					what was concisely spoken by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed do you understand in full<br />
					the meaning of what I said concisely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Body, brother, indeed is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brother, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brother, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">The activites, brother, do not belong to the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brother, is inherent in what is lustful.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must put away desire for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how, brother, the meaning of what I said concisely<br />
					is to be understood in full.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon that brother gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br />
					and welcomed them,<br />
					and he rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter that brother,<br />
					dwelling solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br />
					to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br />
					so that in that very life<br />
					of himself<br />
					he fully understood it,<br />
					realized it<br />
					and abode therein,<br />
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."</p>

					<p class="f4">So that brother was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
