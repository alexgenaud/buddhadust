					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in East Park at the storeyed house of Migāra's mother<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> with a great gathering of the Order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion, - it was the sabbath, the fifteenth day of the moon, on full-moon night, - the Exalted One was seated in the open air surrounded by the Order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother, rising from his seat, and drawing his outer robe over one shoulder, bowed before the Exalted One with folded hands and thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I would fain question the Exalted One on a certain point, if the Exalted One grants permission and would give an answer to my question?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then sit down where you are, brother, and ask what you will."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> "Even so, lord,"<br />

					and thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are these the five grasping-groups, lord, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The grasping body-group,<br />
					the grasping feeling-group,<br />
					the grasping perception-group,<br />
					the grasping activities-group<br />
					the grasping consciousness-group?</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is so, brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those are the five grasping-groups, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The grasping body-group,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But these five graspingṁgroups, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"These five grasping-groups, brother,<br />

					or is grasping something apart from those five groups?</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, brother,<br />
					this same grasping<br />
					is not those five grasping-groups,<br />
					nor yet is it something apart from those five groups.</p>

					<p class="f4">But where there is desire and lust,<br />
					there also is grasping."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is well, lord,"<br />

					<p class="f4">"May it be, lord,<br />
					that in the five graspingṁgroups<br />
					there is a variety of desire and lust?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be so, brother,"<br />
					replied the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, brother, one thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May I be of such a body in future time:<br />
					may I have such feeling,<br />
					such perception,<br />
					such activities,<br />
					such consciousness in future time."</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, brother,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is well, lord,"<br />

					<p class="f4">"What, lord, is the condition,<br />

					<p class="f4">"The four great essentials,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> brother,<br />

It was because this bhikkhu was the teacher of five hundred disciples who were present (?). If he stood up and asked a question, while they sat still, it would show respect for the Master, but their sitting would be disrespectful to their own teacher Whereas if they stood up too, it would be disrespectful to their own teacher, but not to the Master. Moreover, their attention would be distracted from what he said, if they kept standing.' <i>Comy.</i> adds that, of course, the bhikkhu knew the answer to these questions. He merely asked for the sake of his disciples, who might thus get an answer <i>ex cathedra.</i></p>
