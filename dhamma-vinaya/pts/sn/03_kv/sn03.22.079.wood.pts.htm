<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.79. Beginning with a discussion of what it is that one speaks of when one speaks of recollecting past lives, the Buddha then gives some detailed explanation of what is to be understood by shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness. Then speaking of these things as inconstant, painful and not self he describes the arahant as becoming disgsted at them and by that becoming free and by perceiving freedom in that freedom, reaching arahantship. Then further he describes such a one as one who neither heaps up or reduces, neither lets go nor takes up, neither scatters nor gathers." />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever recluses or brahmins, brethren,<br />
					remember their divers former lives,<br />
					in so doing<br />
					all of them remember the five factors of grasping,<br />
					or one or other of these factors, thus: -</p>

					and in so remembering,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Thus and thus in activity was I,'</p>

					<p class="f4">says he;<br />
					and in so remembering<br />
					it is consciousness that he remembers.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, brethren, do ye say 'body'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One is affected, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'body' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Affected by what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Affected by touch of cold and heat,<br />
					of hunger and <a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> thirst,<br />
					of gnats,<br />
					mosquitoes,<br />
					wind<br />

					<p class="f4">And why, brethren, do ye say 'feeling'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One feels, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'feeling' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feels what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Feels pleasure and pain;<br />
					feels neutral feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">One feels, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'feeling'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is used.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, brethren, do ye say 'perception'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One perceives, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'perception' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceives what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceives blue-green,<br />
					perceives yellow,<br />
					or red,<br />
					or white.</p>

					<p class="f4">One perceives, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'perception' is used.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, brethren, do ye say<br />
					'the activities-compound'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they compose a compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why, brethren,<br />
					the word 'activities-compound' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what compound do they compose?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is body that they compose<br />
					into a compound of body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is feeling that they compose<br />
					into a feeling-compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is perception that they compose<br />
					into a perception-compound;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the activities that they compose<br />
					into an activities-compound;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is consciousness that they compose<br />
					into a consciousness-compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">They compose a compound, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the word '(activities)-compound' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg74"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span></a> And why, brethren, do ye say 'consciousness'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One is conscious, brethren.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the word 'consciousness' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conscious of what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of (flavours) sour or bitter;<br />
					acrid or sweet;<br />
					alkaline or non-alkaline;<br />
					saline or non-saline.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Text seems to have a wrong title ('the lion') to this sutta. In the <i>Uddāna,</i> or table of contents at the end of the chapter, it is called <i>Khajjani.</i> The whole chapter is called <i>Khajjanīya</i> (to be eaten). In this section body is likened to a <i>devourer,</i> and at <a href="sn03.22.085.wood.pts.htm">§ 85</a> to a murderer.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> Mrs. C.A. Rhys Davids's analysis of the section in <i>Buddh. Psych.,</i> p. 43. The medweval tradition of Burma conceives <i>sankhārā</i> not as compound but as conditioned, caused.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Rūpaɱ ruppati</i> We cannot keep up the play of words here. Form is in-formed, shape is shaped; body is embodied; it lives by these stimuli, without which there is no consciousness of body. <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases <i>ruppati</i> by words meaning 'is troubled, struck, oppressed, broken up' Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests 'affected' as a compromise.<br />
					'Afflicted' seems to sum up Buddhaghosa's terms. <i>Comy.</i> points out that these are merely reminiscences of something past and perished, not now existing; and so with all the five factors; they all have the characteristics of 'emptiness.' He misconstrues these various contacts not as referring to this life, but as 'informing' creatures in other spheres - <i>e.g.,</i> the cold hell, the hungry-ghost world, etc. He regards 'wind' as referring to flatulence! Etymologically <i>rūpaɱ</i> is not connected with <i>ruppati.</i> <i>This</i> is from <i>rup</i> <i>(lup)</i> to damage; <i>that</i> is probably from <i>varp,</i> shape. See Stede, in <i>Pali Dict.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Text <i>vediyanti,</i> probably an error for sing. <i>vediyati</i> or <i>vedayati.</i> <i>Comy.</i> has both forms and comments on them, but mentions no plural. He says 'no entity feels, but there is just feeling,' omitting the <i>recorder.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Reading with <i>Comy.,</i> <i>rūpa-[vedan]atthāya,</i> etc., for text's <i>rūpattāya-vedanattāya.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.,</i> <i>sañjānāti, vijānati, pajānāti:</i> three stages of consciousness, to be distinguished ss 'awareness, discrimination, decision.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.,</i> <i>khajjāmi,</i> 'body does not rend and eat up the flesh like a worm, but, just as one clothed in a filthy garment suffers discomfort as a consequence of that and says, "the garment eats me up," even so is discomfort to be regarded as consuming him.' <i>Cf.</i> 114, <i>vadhakaɱ rūpaɱ,</i> 'body is a murderer.' So <i>inf.</i> 143, <i>vadhako, eso akkhāto</i> At <i>S.</i> iv, 172-5 in the parable, the <i>pañca-kkhandhā</i> are the 'five murderers.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> illustrates by a story of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who had a thorn in his foot, but did not troublle to pull it out in spite of the pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> [Ed.: the footnote here points to the following, but is more likely missing. It probably was some note in reference to the Pali <i>'apacināti',</i> PED: "to get rid of, do away with, diminish, make less."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Bhikkhu,</i> here in its proper sense of 'almsman,' 'owning nothing.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/thag/thag.1-264.pali.bd.htm#v1084"><i>Thag.</i> 1084;</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.261.rhyc.pts.htm#v1084"><i>Brethren,</i> p 367;</a> <i>D.</i> iii, 197-8; <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/thag/thag.1-264.pali.bd.htm#v1179"><i>Thag.</i> 1179,</a> where the first line of these <i>gāthās</i> occurs in connexion with the praises of the Superman. 'Such a <i>khīṇāsava,</i>' says <i>Comy.,</i> 'the devas honour, even as they honoured <i>Nīlatthera</i> (<i>v.l.</i> <i>Nīta</i> and <i>Citta-tthera</i>), who, having made up his mind to end all there and then, while pondering on his resolve, at the moment of having his head shaved on taking the robes, attained Arahantship.' The verse refers to the brother's resolve, on which he pondered.</p>
