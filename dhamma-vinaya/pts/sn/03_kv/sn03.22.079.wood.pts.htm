<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.79. Beginning with a discussion of what it is that one speaks of when one speaks of recollecting past lives, the Buddha then gives some detailed explanation of what is to be understood by shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness. Then speaking of these things as inconstant, painful and not self he describes the arahant as becoming disgsted at them and by that becoming free and by perceiving freedom in that freedom, reaching arahantship. Then further he describes such a one as one who neither heaps up or reduces, neither lets go nor takes up, neither scatters nor gathers." />

					<p class="f4">Affected by what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Affected by touch of cold and heat,<br />

					<p class="f4">One feels, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'feeling' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feels what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Feels pleasure and pain;<br />
					feels neutral feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">One feels, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, brethren, do ye say 'perception'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceives what?</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the word 'perception' is used.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, brethren, do ye say<br />

					<p class="f4">Because they compose a compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why, brethren,<br />
					the word 'activities-compound' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what compound do they compose?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is body that they compose<br />

					<p class="f4">It is feeling that they compose<br />

					<p class="f4">It is the activities that they compose<br />
					into an activities-compound;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is consciousness that they compose<br />
					into a consciousness-compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">They compose a compound, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the word '(activities)-compound' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg74"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span></a> And why, brethren, do ye say 'consciousness'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One is conscious, brethren.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the word 'consciousness' is used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conscious of what?</p>

					alkaline or non-alkaline;<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> Mrs. C.A. Rhys Davids's analysis of the section in <i>Buddh. Psych.,</i> p. 43. The medieval tradition of Burma conceives <i>sankhārā</i> not as compound but as conditioned, caused.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Rūpaṃ ruppati</i> We cannot keep up the play of words here. Form is in-formed, shape is shaped; body is embodied; it lives by these stimuli, without which there is no consciousness of body. <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases <i>ruppati</i> by words meaning 'is troubled, struck, oppressed, broken up' Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests 'affected' as a compromise.<br />
					'Afflicted' seems to sum up Buddhaghosa's terms. <i>Comy.</i> points out that these are merely reminiscences of something past and perished, not now existing; and so with all the five factors; they all have the characteristics of 'emptiness.' He misconstrues these various contacts not as referring to this life, but as 'informing' creatures in other spheres - <i>e.g.,</i> the cold hell, the hungry-ghost world, etc. He regards 'wind' as referring to flatulence! Etymologically <i>rūpaṃ</i> is not connected with <i>ruppati.</i> <i>This</i> is from <i>rup</i> <i>(lup)</i> to damage; <i>that</i> is probably from <i>varp,</i> shape. See Stede, in <i>Pali Dict.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Text <i>vediyanti,</i> probably an error for sing. <i>vediyati</i> or <i>vedayati.</i> <i>Comy.</i> has both forms and comments on them, but mentions no plural. He says 'no entity feels, but there is just feeling,' omitting the <i>recorder.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> illustrates by a story of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who had a thorn in his foot, but did not troublle to pull it out in spite of the pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> [Ed.: the footnote here points to the following, but is more likely missing. It probably was some note in reference to the Pali <i>'apacināti',</i> PED: "to get rid of, do away with, diminish, make less."</p>

'Such a <i>khīṇāsava,</i>' says <i>Comy.,</i> 'the devas honour, even as they honoured <i>Nīlatthera</i> (<i>v.l.</i> <i>Nīta</i> and <i>Citta-tthera</i>), who, having made up his mind to end all there and then, while pondering on his resolve, at the moment of having his head shaved on taking the robes, attained Arahantship.'
