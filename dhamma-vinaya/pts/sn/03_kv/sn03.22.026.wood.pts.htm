					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, brethren,<br />

					I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what is the satisfaction,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, to me there came this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That ease, that pleasure<br />

					that is the satisfaction of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">That impermanence,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg28"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span></a> So long, brethren, as I did not thoroughly understand,<br />

					the satisfaction of these five factors of grasping as such,<br />
					the misery of it as such,<br />
					the way of escape from it as such, -<br />
					so long, brethren, was I doubtful<br />
					whether I was enlightened<br />
					with that supreme enlightenment,<br />
					unsurpassed in the world<br />
					with its devas,<br />
					its Māras,<br />

					<p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I thoroughly understood,<br />
