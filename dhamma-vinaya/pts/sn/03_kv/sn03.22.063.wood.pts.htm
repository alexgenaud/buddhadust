					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					In jeta Grove,<br />
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine, so that hearing the doctrine of the Exalted One I might dwell solitary, secluded, zealous, ardent and aspiring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brother, if one cling,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cling not, he is released from the evil one."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I understand, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand, Well-farer!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in what way, brother,<br />
					do you understand in full<br />
					the meaning of what I spoke concisely?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to body,<br />
					one is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to feeling,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to perception,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to the activities,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to consciousness,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, lord, is how I understand in full<br />
					what was concisely spoken by the Exalted One."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well have you understood in full<br />
					the meaning of what I spoke concisely.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed by clinging to body,<br />
					one is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to feeling,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to perception,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to the activities,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to consciousness,<br />
					he is Mara's bondsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not clinging,<br />
					he is released from the evil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so should be understood in full<br />
					what I said concisely.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg65"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></a> Thereupon that brother gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br />
					and welcomed them,<br />
					and he rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter that brother,<br />
					dwelling solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br />
					to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br />
					so that in that very life<br />
					of himself<br />
					he fully understood it,<br />
					realized it<br />
					and abode therein,<br />
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So that brother was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
