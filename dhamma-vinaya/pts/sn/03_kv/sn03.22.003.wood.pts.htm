					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Kaccāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Great was dwelling among the folk of Avanti<br />
					at Ospreys' Haunt<br />
					on a sheer mountain crag.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Hāliddikāni came to the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />
					and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the housefather Hāliddikāni thus addressed the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master, it was said by the Exalted One<br />
					in the eighth chapter in the <i>Questions of Māgandiya</i> —<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Home he abandons: homeless wandering<br />
					The sage with village-folk not making ties.<br />
					Empty of lusts, showing no preference,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					With no man wageth wordy warfare more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, Master, how should one regard the full meaning<br />
					of this concisely spoken saying<br />
					of the Exalted One?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The material element, housefather,<br />
					is the home of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now consciousness,<br />
					being lust-tied to the material <a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a> element,<br />
					is called "home-haunter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefather, the feeling-element<br />
					is the home of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the feeling-element,<br />
					consciousness is called "home-haunter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the perception-element, housefather,<br />
					is the home of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the perception-element,<br />
					consciousness is called "home-haunter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the activities-element, housefather,<br />
					is the home of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus being lust-tied to the activities element,<br />
					consciousness is called "home-haunter."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather,<br />
					is the meaning of the word<br />
					"home-haunter."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, housefather,<br />
					is one a "home-abandoner"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to the material element, housefather,<br />
					that desire, that lust, that lure,<br />
					that craving,<br />
					those system-graspings,<br />
					that mental standpoint,<br />
					that dogmatic bias<br />
					which is inherent therein<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					— all these for a Tathāgata are struck off,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made things that have ceased to be,<br />
					so that they cannot grow up again in the future.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So it is also, housefather,<br />
					with the feeling-element,<br />
					the perception-element,<br />
					the activities-element,<br />
					the consciousness-element<br />
					— that desire, that lust, that lure,<br />
					cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, housefather,<br />
					a Tathāgata is called "home-abandoner."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the meaning of the word.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one an "adherent"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>?</p>

					<p class="f4">One who is in bondage to the impressions<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> of things seen, housefather,<br />
					is called "adherent."</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise with regard to sounds,<br />
					smells,<br />
					savours,<br />
					tangibles<br />
					and mental objects<br />
					— he who is in bondage to these impressions<br />
					is called "adherent."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one "non-adherent," housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">Such bondage to impressions of things seen is,<br />
					for a Tathāgata,<br />
					struck off,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree <a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> stump,<br />
					made things that have ceased to be,<br />
					so that they cannot grow up again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, housefather, a Tathāgata is called "non-adherent."</p>

					<p class="f4">So also with regard to sounds,<br />
					smells,<br />
					savours,<br />
					tangibles<br />
					and mental objects<br />
					— such bondage is not found in a Tathāgata:<br />
					therefore is he called "non-adherent."</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is the meaning of the word.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one "a former of ties in the village"?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather,<br />
					a certain one lives intimate with householders.</p>

					<p class="f4">He shares their joys and sorrows;<br />
					among the happy he is happy,<br />
					among the unhappy he is unhappy.<br />
					When affairs of business arise,<br />
					he involves himself in these.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is how one is "a former of ties in the village."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one "no former of ties in the village"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a brother<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> dwells not associating with householders:<br />
					he shares not their joys and sorrows,<br />
					is not happy amid the happy,<br />
					unhappy amid the unhappy.<br />
					When affairs of business arise,<br />
					he does not involve himself in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, one forms no ties in the village.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one "not empty"?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a certain one<br />
					has not abandoned lust,<br />
					has not abandoned desire,<br />
					nor affection,<br />
					nor thirst,<br />
					nor fever and craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, he is "not empty."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one "empty"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a certain one<br />
					has abandoned lust,<br />
					has abandoned desire,<br />
					likewise affection<br />
					and thirst,<br />
					fever and craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, is one "empty."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does one "show no preference"?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, one thinks thus:<br />
					"May I have such and such a body in future time:<br />
					may I feel thus and thus:<br />
					may I perceive thus and thus:<br />
					may my activities be such and such:<br />
					may my consciousness be such and such in future time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, does one show preference.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> And how does one "show no preference"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, one does not think thus:<br />
					"May I have such and such a body in future time:<br />
					may I feel,<br />
					may I perceive thus and thus:<br />
					may my activities be such and such:<br />
					may my consciousness be such and such in future time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, does one show no preference.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one a "wager of wordy warfare with people"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a certain one makes talk like this:<br />
					"You know not about this norm-discipline.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I do know about this norm-discipline.<br />
					How could you know about it?<br />
					You have fallen on wrong views.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I have come by right views.<br />
					You speak last what should come first,<br />
					and first what should come last.<br />
					I am speaking to the point:<br />
					you are not.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					What you have thought out so long is quite upset:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Your view is confuted.<br />
					Go, explain yourself.<br />
					You are shown up.<br />
					Clear yourself if you can!"</p>

					<p class="f4">That, housefather, is how one is a<br />
					"wager of wordy warfare with people."</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is one<br />
					"no wager of wordy warfare with people"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, a brother makes not talk like this:<br />
					"You know not about this norm-discipline.<br />
					I do know about this norm-discipline.<br />
					How could you know about it?<br />
					You have fallen on wrong views.<br />
					I have come by right views.<br />
					You speak last what should come first,<br />
					and first what should come last.<br />
					I am speaking to the point:<br />
					you are not.<br />
					What you have thought out so long is quite upset:<br />
					Your view is confuted.<br />
					Go, explain yourself.<br />
					You are shown up.<br />
					Clear yourself if you can!"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how one is "no wager of wordy warfare with people."</p>

					<p class="f4">And this, housefather, is the meaning<br />
					of what was said by the Exalted One<br />
					in the eighth chapter of Magandiya's Questions, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Home he abandons: homeless wandering<br />
					The sage with village-folk not making ties.<br />
					Empty of lusts, showing no preference,<br />
					With no man wageth wordy warfare more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, should be understood in full<br />
					what was concisely stated by the Exalted One.'</p>
