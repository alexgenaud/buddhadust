<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.97. A bhikkhu asks if there is any shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, or consciousness which is stable and everlasting. He is told that there is not, and then the Buddha explains that if there were one of the stockpiles (khandhas) even as small as a bit of dust that were stable and everlasting there would be no need to teach the Dhamma." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any perception<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One took up a pinch of dust on the tip of his nail and said to that brother:</p>
