<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.25.7. The Buddha first lays out the doctrine of the inconstance of  intentions with regard to sights, sounds, scents, savours, touches and phenomena, and then states that anyone who moderately approves of this doctrine is called a Streamwinner by faith, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one has a certain amount of insight into this doctrine one is called one who is a Streamwinner by Dhamma, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one sees these things as they are, one is called a Streamwinner." />

							<p>Which appears to be an argument arising from an understanding that <i>'~sañcetanā'</i> implies an intrensic moral value within or attached to (<i>(sañ)</i>) sights, etc. The counter-argument here points to <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.171.wood.pts.htm">AN 4.171.</a> where it is explained that <i>kamma</i> (good or bad action) <i>is</i> essentially defined by <i>'sañcetanā'</i> ('intent with regard to' or even possibly 'own-intent' 'identified-with intent'.) Woodward attempts to clarify the matter with his 'acts occasioned by'. Intent is an act <i>(kamma)</i> but this goes too far from the Pali. The literal translation of <i>cetana</i> would be something like 'having the heart for' and this sutta does not go further than that into such things as acts of body related to sights etc.</p>
