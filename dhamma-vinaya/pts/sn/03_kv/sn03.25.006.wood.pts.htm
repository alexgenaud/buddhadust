<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.25.6. The Buddha first lays out the doctrine of the inconstance of  perceptions of sights, sounds, scents, savours, touches and phenomena, and then states that anyone who moderately approves of this doctrine is called a Streamwinner by faith, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one has a certain amount of insight into this doctrine one is called one who is a Streamwinner by Dhamma, one who will become a Streamwinner at or before death; if one sees these things as they are, one is called a Streamwinner." />
