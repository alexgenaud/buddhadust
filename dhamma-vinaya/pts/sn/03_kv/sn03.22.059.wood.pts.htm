					<p class="f4">At that time the Exalted One thus addressed the band of five brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Body, brethren, is not the Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If body, brethren, were the Self,<br />

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />

					feels disgust for feeling,<br />
					feels disgust for perception,<br />
					feels disgust for the activities,<br />
					feels disgust for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So feeling disgust<br />
					he is repelled;<br />
					being repelled,<br />
					he is freed;<br />
					knowledge arises<br />
					that in the freed<br />
					is the freed thing;<br />
					so that he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth;<br />
					lived is the righteous life;<br />
					done is my task;<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and the band of five brethren were pleased thereat,<br />
					and welcomed what was said by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, by this teaching<br />
					thus uttered<br />
					the hearts of those five brethren<br />
					were freed from the <i>āsavas</i><br />
					without grasping.</p>
