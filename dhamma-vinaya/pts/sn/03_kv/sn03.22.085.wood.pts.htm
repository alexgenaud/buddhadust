					<p class="f4">2. At that time there had arisen in the mind of a certain brother named Yamaka<br />
					such an evil heresy as this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One:—<br />
					In so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now a number of brethren heard of this evil heresy<br />
					that had arisen in the mind of the brother Yamaka,<br />
					"thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One —<br />
					in so far as a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body is broken up,<br />
					he becomes not after death."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brethren came to the venerable Yamaka,<br />
					greeted him<br />
					and exchanged with him the courtesy of civil words<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					those brethren thus addressed the venerable Yamaka:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as they say, friend Yamaka,<br />
					that such an evil heresy as this<br />
					has arisen in your mind:<br />
					'Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One —<br />
					in so far as a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body is broken up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "Even so, friends, do I understand it."</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "Say not so, friend Yamaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">Overstate not thus the Exalted One's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were ill-done to overstate the Exalted One's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely he would not say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A brother who has destroyed the āsavas"<br />
					is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up:<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">8. But the brother Yamaka,<br />
					though thus rebuked by those brethren,<br />
					still remained steadfast in his stubborn perversity,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					maintaining:<br />
					"As I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One:<br />
					in so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. So, as those brethren could not move the venerable Yamaka<br />
					from this evil heresy,<br />
					they rose up<br />
					and went to the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, there has arisen in the mind<br />
					of the venerable Yamaka<br />
					this evil heresy:<br />
					'in so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well if the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					went to the venerable Yamaka,<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Sāriputta consented<br />
					by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at eventide<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta rose up from his solitude<br />
					and went to the brother Yamaka,<br />
					and greeting him with courtesy<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta said<br />
					to the venerable Yamaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, friend Yamaka,<br />
					as they say,<br />
					that you hold this evil heresy:</p>
					that such an evil heresy as this<br />
					has arisen in your mind:<br />
					'Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One —<br />
					in so far as a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body is broken up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is true, friend,<br />
					that thus do I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One:<br />
					'that in so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, as to this, friend Yamaka,<br />
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					are they permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore ... one who thus sees ... he knows,<br />
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now herein, friend Yamaka,<br />
					do you regard a Tathāgata<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> as body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard a Tathāgata<br />
					as either feeling,<br />
					or as perception,<br />
					or as the activities,<br />
					or as consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you as to this, friend?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is a Tathāgata in the body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard a Tathāgata as distinct from body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you regard him as in feeling,<br />
					or as distinct from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">In perception,<br />
					or as distinct from perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the activities,<br />
					or as distinct from the activities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you regard a Tathāgata as in consciousness<br />
					or as distinct from consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As none of these, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now as to this, friend,<br />
					do you regard a Tathāgata as body,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now as to this, friend Yamaka,<br />
					do you regard a Tathāgata<br />
					as this one who has not a body,<br />
					not feeling,<br />
					not perception,<br />
					not activities,<br />
					not consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, friend Yamaka,<br />
					since in this very life<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a Tathāgata is not to be regarded as existing in truth,<br />
					in reality,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is it <a id="pg96"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span></a> proper for you to assert:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One,<br />
					in so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when body is broken up,<br />
					he becomes not after death"?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It was in my folly, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					that I came to hold this evil heresy,<br />
					but now that I have heard the explanation of the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					this evil heresy is put away,<br />
					and I am established in the Norm."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, friend Yamaka,<br />
					if they were to ask you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to that brother, friend,<br />
					who has destroyed the āsavas;<br />
					when the body is broken up,<br />
					does he become after death?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, friend,<br />
					what would you assert?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, friend, they were thus to question me,<br />
					thus should I assert:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Body, friends, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent, that is woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is woe, has ceased,<br />
					been destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">So with feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent, that is woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is woe has ceased,<br />
					been destroyed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I should assert, friend,<br />
					if I were questioned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, friend Yamaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I will show you a parable<br />
					to show my meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, friend Yamaka,<br />
					a housefather, or his son,<br />
					a rich man,<br />
					exceeding rich and prosperous,<br />
					with a strong body-guard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then suppose some fellow<br />
					desirous of his loss and harm,<br />
					desirous of troubling his serenity,<br />
					longing to slay him,<br />
					should say to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here is this housefather<br />
					[or housefather's son],<br />
					a rich man,<br />
					exceeding rich and prosperous;<br />
					but, as he has a strong body-guard,<br />
					it would not be easy to slay him by force.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to work my way in<br />
					and so slay him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he approaches that housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son,<br />
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would enter your service, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So that housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son,<br />
					admits him to his service.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the other,<br />
					by rising up early<br />
					and so late taking rest,<br />
					becomes a willing servant<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> to him,<br />
					eager to please<br />
					and well-spoken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that housefather,<br />
					or <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> housefather's son,<br />
					comes to trust him<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> as a friend and confidant,<br />
					and thus makes a companion of him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now when this fellow is assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son as it may be,<br />
					is my boon companion,'<br />
					then, catching him in a lonely place,<br />
					he slays him with a sharp sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to this, friend Yamaka,<br />
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">When that fellow went to such and such a housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son,<br />
					and said to him:<br />
					'I would enter your service, master,' —<br />
					was he not even then a murderer?</p>

					<p class="f4">But, though he was a murderer,<br />
					was not his master unaware of this fact,<br />
					'I have a murderer'.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So also, when he entered his service,<br />
					rose up early and late took rest,<br />
					was a willing servant to him,<br />
					eager to please and speaking affectionately,<br />
					was he not even then a murderer,<br />
					though his master knew it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He was, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, friend,<br />
					the untaught Ariyan disciple,<br />
					who discerns not those who are Ariyans;<br />
					who is unskilled in the Ariyan Norm,<br />
					untrained in the Ariyan Norm;<br />
					who discerns not the worthy ones,<br />
					who is unskilled in the worthy Norm,<br />
					untrained in the worthy Norm, —<br />
					such an one regards body as the Self,<br />
					or the Self as having a body,<br />
					or body as being in the Self,<br />
					or the Self as being in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise with regard to feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities<br />
					and consciousness  ...<br />
					he understands not the impermanent body<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					that it is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the impermanent feeling<br />
					he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					that it is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the impermanent perception,<br />
					of the impermanent activities ...<br />
					of the impermanent consciousness,<br />
					he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					that it is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the woeful body<br />
					he understands not ...<br />
					that it is woeful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so also of the other factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Selfless body<br />
					he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					that it is Selfless ...<br />
					and so of the other factors.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> Of the compounded body<br />
					he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					that it is a compound ...<br />
					and so of the other factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the murderous body<br />
					he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					that it is murderous ...<br />
					and so of the other factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">He approaches a body,<br />
					lays hold of it,<br />
					and is assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He approaches feeling,<br />
					approaches perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					lays hold of it<br />
					and is assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is the Self of me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the five grasping groups are approached<br />
					and laid hold of by him,<br />
					and they turn to his loss and suffering<br />
					for many a long day.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					who discerns those that are Ariyans ...<br />
					who is well trained in the worthy Norm ...<br />
					regards not the body as the Self,<br />
					nor the Self as having body,<br />
					nor body as being in the Self,<br />
					nor the Self as being in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards not feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities<br />
					and consciousness in this way.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards the impermanent body,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					as impermanent;<br />
					and so does he regard the other factors ...<br />
					as impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards the woeful body,<br />
					the woeful feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					and consciousness,<br />
					as woeful,<br />
					as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards the Selfless body<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					as Selfless.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also of feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards the compounded body<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					as a compound.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also of the other factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">He regards the murderous body<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					as murderous.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also does he regard the other factors,<br />
					as murderous.</p>

					<p class="f4">He approaches not a body,<br />
					lays not hold of a body,<br />
					is not assured,<br />
					'I have the Self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He approaches not feeling,<br />
					perception<br />
					and the other factors,<br />
					lays not hold of them,<br />
					is not assured<br />
					'I have the Self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the five groups based on grasping<br />
					are not approached,<br />
					not laid hold of by him,<br />
					and so they turn to his bliss and pleasure<br />
					for many a long day."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, happy, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					are those venerable ones<br />
					who have such co-mates as thee<br />
					in the righteous life,<br />
					so compassionate,<br />
					so anxious for their welfare,<br />
					such teachers,<br />
					such expounders!</p>

					<p class="f4">And now that I have heard this Norm-teaching <a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> from the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					my heart is released from the āsavas<br />
					without any grasping."</p>

					<p class="f4">So spake the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and the venerable Yamaka rejoiced thereat<br />
					and welcomed the words of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>
