					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. At that time there had arisen<br />
					in the mind of a certain brother named Yamaka<br />
					such an evil heresy as this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One:—</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now a number of brethren heard of this evil heresy<br />
					that had arisen in the mind of the brother Yamaka,<br />
					"Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One —<br />
					in so far as a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body is broken up,<br />
					he becomes not after death."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brethren came to the venerable Yamaka,<br />
					greeted him<br />
					and exchanged with him the courtesy of civil words<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					those brethren thus addressed the venerable Yamaka:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as they say, friend Yamaka,<br />
					that such an evil heresy as this<br />
					has arisen in your mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One —<br />
					in so far as a brother who has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body is broken up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "Even so, friends, do I understand it."</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "Say not so, friend Yamaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">Overstate not thus the Exalted One's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were ill-done to overstate the Exalted One's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely he would not say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A <a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a> brother who has destroyed the āsavas"<br />
					is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up:<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">8. But the brother Yamaka,<br />
					though thus rebuked by those brethren,<br />
					still remained steadfast in his stubborn perversity,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					maintaining:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One: in so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. So, as those brethren could not move the venerable Yamaka<br />
					from this evil heresy,<br />
					they rose up<br />
					and went to the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta, there has arisen in the mind<br />
					of the venerable Yamaka<br />
					this evil heresy:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well if the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					went to the venerable Yamaka,<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Sāriputta consented<br />
					by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at eventide<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta rose up from his solitude<br />
					and went to the brother Yamaka,<br />
					and greeting him with courtesy<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta said<br />
					to the venerable Yamaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, friend Yamaka,<br />
					as they say,<br />
					that you hold this evil heresy:<br />
					that such an evil heresy as this<br />
					has arisen in your mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus do I understand the doctrine<br />
					taught by the Exalted One —<br />

					he becomes not after death.'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is true, friend,<br />
					that thus do I understand the doctrine taught by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That in so far as a brother has destroyed the āsavas,<br />
					he is broken up<br />
					and perishes when the body breaks up,<br />
					he becomes not after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, as to this, friend Yamaka,<br />
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which is impermanent,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, friend Yamaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I will show you a parable<br />
					to show my meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, friend Yamaka,<br />
					a housefather, or his son,<br />
					a rich man,<br />
					exceeding rich and prosperous,<br />
					with a strong body-guard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then suppose some fellow<br />
					desirous of his loss and harm,<br />
					desirous of troubling his serenity,<br />
					longing to slay him,<br />
					should say to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here is this housefather<br />
					[or housefather's son],<br />
					a rich man,<br />
					exceeding rich and prosperous;<br />
					but, as he has a strong body-guard,<br />
					it would not be easy to slay him by force.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to work my way in<br />
					and so slay him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he approaches that housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son,<br />
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would enter your service, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So that housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son,<br />
					admits him to his service.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the other,<br />
					by rising up early<br />
					and so late taking rest,<br />
					becomes a willing servant<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> to him,<br />
					eager to please<br />
					and well-spoken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that housefather,<br />
					or <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> housefather's son,<br />
					comes to trust him<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> as a friend and confidant,<br />
					and thus makes a companion of him.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now when this fellow is assured:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son as it may be,<br />
					is my boon companion,'<br />
					then, catching him in a lonely place,<br />
					he slays him with a sharp sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as to this, friend Yamaka,<br />
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">When that fellow went to such and such a housefather,<br />
					or housefather's son,<br />
					and said to him:<br />
					'I would enter your service, master,' —<br />
					was he not even then a murderer?</p>

					<p class="f4">But, though he was a murderer,<br />
					was not his master unaware of this fact,<br />
					'I have a murderer'.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So also, when he entered his service,<br />
					rose up early and late took rest,<br />
					was a willing servant to him,<br />
					eager to please and speaking affectionately,<br />
					was he not even then a murderer,<br />
					though his master knew it not?"</p>
