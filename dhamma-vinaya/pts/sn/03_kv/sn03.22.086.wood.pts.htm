					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesalī,</a><br />

					<p class="f4">Then a number of wandering heretics<br />

					greeted him<br />
					and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					those heretic Wanderers said to the venerable Anurādha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anurādha, a Tathāgata,<br />

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side<br />
