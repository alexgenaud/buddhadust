					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesalī,</a><br />
					in Great Grove, at the Hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the venerable Anurādha<br />
					was staying not far from the Exalted One<br />
					in a forest hut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of wandering heretics came to the venerable Anurādha,<br />
					greeted him<br />
					and exchanged the courtesies of civil words<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					those heretic Wanderers said to the venerable Anurādha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Anurādha, a Tathāgata,<br />
					a superman,<br />
					one of the best of men,<br />
					a winner of the highest gain,<br />

					<p class="f4">Upon this the venerable Anuradha<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Anurādha<br />

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side<br />
					the venerable Anurādha thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am staying here, lord,<br />

					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a number of heretic Wanderers came to me<br />
