					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Kaccāna the Great was staying among the folk of Avanti<br />
					at Ospreys' Haunt<br />
					on a sheer mountain crag.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather, Hāliddikāni came to the venerable Kaccāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat beside him,<br />
					the housefather Hāliddikāni said to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus was it said, Master, by the Exalted One,<br />
					in the <i>Questions of Sakka:</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who are freed by the utter destruction of craving,<br />
					they only are fully proficient,<br />
					they only have fully reached the infinite safety,<br />
					they only fully live the righteous life,<br />
					have fully reached the goal<br />
					— best of devas and men are they.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, Master, how should one regard<br />
					the full meaning of this concise saying<br />
					of the Exalted One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to the material element, housefather,<br />
					that desire,<br />
					that lust,<br />
					that lure,<br />
					that craving,<br />
					those system-graspings,<br />
					that mental standpoint,<br />
					that dogmatic bias<br />
					which is inherent therein<br />
					— it is by the destruction,<br />
					by the not lusting for,<br />
					by the cessation,<br />
					the giving up,<br />
					the utter surrender of those things<br />
					that the heart is called 'fully freed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to the feeling-element, housefather,<br />

					<p class="f4">"As to the perception-element, housefather,<br />
					that desire,<br />
					that lust,<br />

					that craving,<br />
					those system-graspings,<br />
					that mental standpoint,<br />
					that dogmatic bias<br />

					<p class="f4">"As to the consciousness-element, housefather,<br />
					that desire,<br />
					that lust,<br />
					that lure,<br />
					that craving,<br />
					those system-graspings,<br />

					that the heart is called 'fully freed.'</p>


					<p class="f4">Thus, housefather, what was said by the Exalted One<br />
					in the Questions of Sakka, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who are freed by the utter destruction of craving,<br />
					they only are fully proficient,<br />
					they only have fully reached the infinite safety,<br />
					fully practise the righteous life,<br />
					have fully reached the goal<br />
					— best of devas and men are they'</p>

					<p class="f4">— that is how one should regard the full meaning<br />
					of this concise saying of the Exalted One.'</p>
