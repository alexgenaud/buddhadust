<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.24.1. The Buddha states that the view that the world and the things of the world are static arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind." />

							<p><i>Leso.</i> PED has 'particle'. But the idea is 'illusion'. Their idea was that 'the world' consists of a number of unchanging illusions strung together giving rise to the further illusion of motion. Much like a number of still images strung together create the illusion of movement in a movie. Gotama's idea is that this is only one way of viewing things. We might compare the moving picture created by still photograps to the moving picture created by the changing of pixles in a video stream; a vinyl record compared to a digital CD. Further, with the modern idea of quantum mechanics, we would say that even the illusions did not have existence prior to their being the object of observation.</p>
