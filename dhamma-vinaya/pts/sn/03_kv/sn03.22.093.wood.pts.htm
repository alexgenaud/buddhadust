					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a stream, brethren,<br />
					a mountain-torrent,<br />
					down-drawing,<br />
					rising from afar,<br />
					swift-flowing,<br />
					and on both its banks are growing<br />
					grasses which overhang the stream,<br />
					kusa-grass there might be that overhangs,<br />
					reeds and creepers<br />
					and over-hanging shrubs;<br />
					and a man is swept away by that stream<br />
					and clutches at the grasses,<br />
					but they might break away,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					he might clutch at the shrubs,<br />
					but they might break away,<br />
					and owing to that he might come by his destruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren,<br />
					the untaught manyfolk,<br />
					who discerns not those who are Ariyans;<br />

					untrained in the Ariyan Norm;<br />
					who discerns not the worthy ones,<br />
					who is unskilled in the worthy Norm,<br />
					untrained in the worthy Norm,<br />
					regard the body as the self,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard perception as the self,<br />
					or the self as having perception,<br />
					or perception as being in the self,<br />
					or the self as being in perception.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then perception breaks away,<br />
					and owing to that<br />
					they come by their destruction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">They regard consciousness as the self,<br />
					or the self as having consciousness,<br />
					or consciousness as being in the self,<br />
