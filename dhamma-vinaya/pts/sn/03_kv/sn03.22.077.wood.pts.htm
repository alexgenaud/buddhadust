					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					In jeta Grove,<br />
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br />
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the way one should regard things<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					feels disgust at body,<br />
					feels disgust at feeling,<br />
					feels disgust at perception,<br />
					feels disgust at activities<br />
					feels disgust at consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling disgust<br />
					he is repelled:<br />
					by repulsion he is released;<br />
					by that release<br />
					set free,<br />
					knowledge arises:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the freed man<br />
					is the free thing'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br />
					lived is the righteous life;<br />
					done is the task;<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Throughout the seven abodes, brethren,<br />
					up to the highest becoming,<br />
					these are the topmost,<br />
					these are the best in all the world, -<br />
					these Arahants."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>
