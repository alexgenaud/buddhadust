<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.100. The Buddha likens the way the commoner runs around after shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness to the way a dog tied to a post runs round and round the post and never gets free of the post. Then he likens the creativity of mind in devising the taints that corrupt individuals to that of the hypnotist creating an illusion, to nature in devising the various forms of animals, or to an artest creating an image of a man or a woman." />
