The Buddha teaches that that which is not self should not be regarded as the self. So seeing form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness is sufficient to be repelled by them and that being repelled one is free." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine,<br />
					I am not it,<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine,<br />
					I am not it,<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Perception, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine,<br />
					I am not it,<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"The activities, brethren, are void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine,<br />
					I am not it,<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness, brethren, is void of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br />
					that is suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is suffering,<br />
					that is void of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is void of the self,<br />
					that is not mine,<br />
					I am not it,<br />
					it is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is to be regarded<br />
					by perfect insight of whet it really is.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by body,<br />
					is repelled by feeling,<br />
					is repelled by perception,<br />
					is repelled by the activities<br />
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br />
					he lusts not<br />
					not lusting he is set free<br />
					in this freedom comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is my task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
