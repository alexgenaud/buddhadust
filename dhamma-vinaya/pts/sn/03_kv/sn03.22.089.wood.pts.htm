					<p class="f4">Once a number of brethren were staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī,</a><br />
					in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Khemaka was staying in Jujube Tree Park,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					being sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> Then the elder brethren,<br />
					rising at eventide from their solitude,<br />
					called to the venerable Dāsaka:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friend Dāsaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you to brother Khemaka and say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, the elder brethren say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We hope you are bearing up, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">We hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?"'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friends," said the venerable Dāsaka in reply to those brethren,<br />
					and approaching the venerable Khemaka,<br />
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka, the elder brethren say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We hope you are bearing up, friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">We hope you are enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">To which the venerable Khemaka replied:</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friends, I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of my pains abating<br />
					and not increasing."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Dāsaka returned to the elder brethren, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka sais this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, friends, I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of my pains abating<br />

					<p class="f4">Then said they again:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friend Dāsaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you again to the venerable Khemaka and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, the elders say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, in this fivefold grasping-group,<br />
					so called by the Exalted One,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the grasping-group of body,<br />
					the grasping-group of feeling,<br />
					the grasping-group of perception,<br />
					the grasping-group of the activities,<br />
					the grasping-group of consciousness — <br />
					in these five groups<br />
					does the venerable Khemaka discern the Self<br />
					or anything pertaining to the Self?'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friends," replied the venerable Dāsaka,<br />
					and approaching the venerable Khemaka,<br />
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka, the elder brethren say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, in this fivefold grasping-group,<br />
					so called by the Exalted One,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the grasping-group of body,<br />

					the grasping-group of the activities,<br />
					the grasping-group of consciousness — <br />
					in these five groups<br />
					does the venerable Khemaka discern the Self<br />

					<p class="f4">"In these five grasping-groups, friend,"<br />

					I discern no Self<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Dāsaka went back to the brethren and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka sais this:</p>

					"to wit:<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said they again:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friend Dāsaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you again to the venerable Khemaka and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, the elders say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If then in the fivefold grasping-group<br />
					the venerable Khemaka discerns no Self<br />
					nor aught pertaining to the Self,<br />
					the venerable Khemaka must be arahant,<br />
					one in whom the āsavas are destroyed."'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friends," replied the venerable Dāsaka,<br />
					and approaching the venerable Khemaka,<br />
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka, the elder brethren say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If then in the fivefold grasping-group<br />
					the venerable Khemaka discerns no Self<br />
					nor aught pertaining to the Self,<br />
					the venerable Khemaka must be arahant,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Though, friend, I discern<br />
					in the fivefold grasping-group<br />
					no Self<br />
					nor aught pertaining <a id="pg109"><span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span></a> to the Self,<br />
					yet am I not arahant,<br />
					nor one in whom the <i>āsavas</i> are destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though, friend, I see<br />
					that I have got the idea of 'I am'<br />
					in the fivefold grasping-group,<br />
					yet do I not discern<br />
					that I am this 'I am.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Dāsaka returned to the brethren and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka sais this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though, friends, I discern<br />
					in the fivefold grasping-group<br />
					no Self<br />
					nor aught pertaining to the Self,<br />
					yet am I not arahant,<br />

					<p class="f4">Though, friend, I see<br />

					in the fivefold grasping-group,<br />
					yet do I not discern<br />
					that I am this "I am."'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said they again:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friend Dāsaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you again to the venerable Khemaka and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, the elders say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this 'I am,' friend Khemaka,<br />
					of which you speak,<br />
					what do you mean by this 'I am'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as body,<br />
					or as distinct from body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as feeling,<br />
					or as distinct from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as perception,<br />
					or as distinct from perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as the activities,<br />
					or as distinct from the activities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as consciousness,<br />
					or as distinct from consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this 'I am,' what do you mean by it?"'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friends," replied the venerable Dāsaka,<br />
					and approaching the venerable Khemaka,<br />
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Khemaka, the elder brethren say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to this "I am," friend Khemaka,<br />
					of which you speak,<br />
					what do you mean by this "I am"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of "I am" as body,<br />
					or as distinct from body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of "I am" as feeling,<br />
					or as distinct from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of "I am" as perception,<br />
					or as distinct from perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of "I am" as the activities,<br />
					or as distinct from the activities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of "I am" as consciousness,<br />
					or as distinct from consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this "I am," what do you mean by it?'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, friend Dāsaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">What boots this running to and fro?</p>

					<p class="f4">Fetch my staff.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will go myself to these brethren."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Khemaka,<br />
					leaning on his staff,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> came to those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he got there,<br />
					he greeted them,<br />
					and exchanging the courtesies of civil words,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat,<br />
					the elders thus spoke to the venerable Khemaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this 'I am,' friend Khemaka,<br />
					of which you speak,<br />
					what do you mean by this 'I am'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as body,<br />
					or as distinct from body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as feeling,<br />
					or as distinct from feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as perception,<br />
					or as distinct from perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as the activities,<br />
					or as distinct from the activities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you speak of 'I am' as consciousness,<br />
					or as distinct from consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this 'I am,' what do you mean by it?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friends, I do not say 'I am body';<br />
					I do not say 'I am feeling';<br />
					I do not say 'I am perception';<br />
					I do not say 'I am the activities';<br />
					I do not say 'I am consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though, friends, I see<br />
					that I have got the idea of 'I am'<br />
					in the five grasping-groups,<br />
					yet I do not discern<br />
					that I am this 'I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, friends, in <a id="pg110"><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></a> the case of the scent of a blue lotus<br />
					or a white lotus, -<br />
					if one should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The scent belongs to the petals<br />
					or the colour<br />
					or the fibres of it,'</p>

					<p class="f4">would he be rightly describing the scent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then how would he be right<br />
					in describing it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, friend, by speaking of the scent of the flower."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friends,<br />
					I do not speak of the 'I am' as a body,<br />
					I do not speak of the 'I am' as feeling,<br />
					I do not speak of the 'I am' as perception,<br />
					I do not speak of the 'I am' as the activities,<br />
					I do not speak of the 'I am' as consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I see<br />
					that in these five grasping-groups<br />
					I have got the idea of 'I am'<br />
					yet I do not discern<br />
					that I am this 'I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though, friends, an Ariyan disciple<br />
					has put away the five lower fetters,<br />
					yet there remains in him<br />
					a subtle remnant<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from among the five grasping-groups,<br />
					a subtle remnant of the I-conceit,<br />
					of the I am-desire,<br />
					of the lurking tendency to think 'I am,'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					still not removed from him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on<br />
					he lives contemplating the rise and fall<br />
					of the five grasping-groups,<br />
					seeing thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is body,<br />
					such is the arising of body,<br />
					such is the ceasing of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling,<br />
					such is the arising of feeling,<br />
					such is the ceasing of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is perception,<br />
					such is the arising of perception,<br />
					such is the ceasing of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the activities,<br />
					such is the arising of the activities,<br />
					such is the ceasing of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness,<br />
					such is the arising of consciousness,<br />
					such is the ceasing of consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way,<br />
					as he lives in the contemplation of the five grasping-groups,<br />
					that subtle remnant of the I am-conceit,<br />
					of the I am-desire,<br />
					that lurking tendency to think 'I am,'<br />
					which was still not removed from him, -<br />
					that is now removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, friends,<br />
					there is a dirty soiled cloth,<br />
					and the owners give it to a washerman,<br />
					and he rubs it smooth with salt-earth,<br />
					or lye<br />
					or cowdung,<br />
					and rinses it in pure clean water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, though that cloth be clean,<br />
					utterly cleansed,<br />
					yet there hangs about it,<br />
					still unremoved,<br />
					the smell of the salt-earth<br />
					or lye<br />
					or cowdung.</p>

					<p class="f4">The washerman returns it to the owners,<br />
					and they lay it up<br />
					in a sweet-scented coffer.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that smell of salt-earth<br />
					or lye<br />
					or cowdung,<br />
					that hung about it<br />
					and was not removed,<br />
					is now utterly removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, friends<br />
					though an Ariyan disciple<br />
					has put away the five lower fetters,<br />
					<a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> yet there remains in him<br />
					a subtle remnant<br />
					from among the five grasping-groups,<br />
					a subtle remnant of the I-conceit,<br />
					of the I am-desire,<br />
					of the lurking tendency to think 'I am,'<br />
					still not removed from him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on<br />
					he lives contemplating the rise and fall<br />
					of the five grasping-groups,<br />
					seeing thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is body,<br />
					such is the arising of body,<br />
					such is the ceasing of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling,<br />
					such is the arising of feeling,<br />
					such is the ceasing of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is perception,<br />
					such is the arising of perception,<br />
					such is the ceasing of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the activities,<br />
					such is the arising of the activities,<br />
					such is the ceasing of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness,<br />
					such is the arising of consciousness,<br />
					such is the ceasing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way,<br />
					as he lives in the contemplation of the five grasping-groups,<br />
					that subtle remnant of the I am-conceit,<br />
					of the I am-desire,<br />
					that lurking tendency to think 'I am,'<br />
					which was still not removed from him, -<br />
					that is now utterly removed."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Upon this the elders said to the venerable Khemaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed we did not put these questions to the venerable Khemaka<br />
					from a wish to trouble him.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was because we thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The venerable Khemaka is able to expound in full<br />
					the teaching of the Exalted One,<br />
					able to teach it,<br />
					to make it known,<br />
					to set it forth,<br />
					to make it clear,<br />
					to open it up,<br />
					to analyze it,<br />
					to make it plain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so the venerable Khemaka has expounded in full<br />
					the teaching of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has taught it,<br />
					made it known,<br />
					set it forth,<br />
					made it clear,<br />
					opened it up,<br />
					analyzed it,<br />
					made it plain."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the venerable Khemaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">The elders were pleased at the words of the venerable Khemaka and welcomed them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when this teaching was thus expounded<br />
					the hearts of as many as sixty brethren<br />
					were utterly set free<br />
					from the <i>āsavas,</i><br />
					and so was it also<br />
					with the heart of the venerable Khemaka.</p>
