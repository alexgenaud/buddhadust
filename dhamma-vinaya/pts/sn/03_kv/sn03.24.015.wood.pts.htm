The Buddha states that the view that the Thathagata (one who has attained the goal) exists arises from not understanding the impermanent and painful nature of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness and the seen, heard, sensed, cognized, acquired, investigated, or turned over in mind." />
