					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One thus addressed the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is an ill,<br />
					both in the past and in the future,<br />
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					cares not for a body that is past,<br />
					is not in love with a body to be,<br />
					and for the present body<br />
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br />
					seeks dispassion for it,<br />
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is an ill,<br />
					both in the past and in the future,<br />
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					cares not for feeling that is past,<br />
					is not in love with feeling to be,<br />
					and for the present feeling<br />
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br />
					seeks dispassion for it,<br />
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is an ill,<br />
					both in the past and in the future,<br />
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					cares not for perception that is past,<br />
					is not in love with perception to be,<br />
					and for the present perception<br />
					seeks to be repelled by it,<br />
					seeks dispassion for it,<br />
					seeks the ceasing of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are an ill,<br />
					both in the past and in the future,<br />
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					cares not for the activities that are past,<br />
					is not in love with the activities to be,<br />
					and for the present activities<br />
					seeks to be repelled by them,<br />
					seeks dispassion for them,<br />
					seeks the ceasing of them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consciousness is an ill,<br />
					both in the past and in the future,<br />
					not to speak of the present.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />

					seeks to be repelled by it,<br />
