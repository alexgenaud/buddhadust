					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					In jeta Grove,<br />
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">I</h4>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well for me,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine in a few words,<br />
					so that hearing the teaching of the Exalted One<br />
					I might dwell solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent <a id="pg33"><span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span></a><br />
					and aspiring.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(The Exalted One said):</p>

					<p class="f4">"That for which a brother has a bias,<br />
					by that he is reckoned.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That for which he does not have a bias,<br />
					by that he is not reckoned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I understand, 0 Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand, 0 Well-farer!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how far, brother, do you understand in full<br />
					the meaning of what I have thus concisely stated?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one cleave to body, lord,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleave to feeling,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleave to perception,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleave to the activities,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleave to consciousness,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if, lord, he cleavc not to body,<br />
					he gets no name thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleavc not to feeling,<br />
					he gets no name thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleavc not to perception,<br />
					he gets no name thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleavc not to the activities,<br />
					he gets no name thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he cleavc not to consciousness,<br />
					he gets no name thereby."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well do you understand in full<br />
					the meaning of what I concisely stated.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one cleave to body,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one cleave to feeling,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one cleave to perception,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one cleave to the activities,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one cleave to consciousness,<br />
					by that he gets a name.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if one cleavc not to body,<br />
					he gets no name thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one cleavc not to feeling,<br />

					<p class="f4">If one cleavc not to consciousness,<br />
					he gets no name thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how to understand in full<br />
					the meaning of what I concisely stated."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that brother welcomed the saying of the Exalted One,<br />
					and was pleased thereat,<br />
					and he rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">II.</h4>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon that brother,<br />
					living solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time attained that goal<br />
					for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br />
					for the homeless life,<br />
					even that unrivalled goal of righteous living;<br />
					attained it even in that very life:<br />
					and knowing it for himself,<br />
					realizing it for himself,<br />
					abode therein,<br />
					so that he came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"De- <a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> stroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is my task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And that brother was now one of the saints.</p>

							<p>Mrs. Rhys Davids understanding is correct as far as it goes, but the deeper meaning is in a literal understanding. One seeks or desires to exist in a body, with sense-experiences, with perception, acting to create experience, and having consciousness.</p>
