<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.135. Upon being asked, the venerable Sāriputta teaches the venerable Maha Kotthita the definition of 'blindness' and 'vision' in terms of understanding shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness, understanding their arising, understanding their passing-away, and understanding the walk to walk to bring about their end." />

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a><br />
					and the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/mahakotthito.htm">Mahā-Koṭṭhita</a><br />

					in the Deer-Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br />
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br />
					came to the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Ignorance! Ignorance!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, friend Sāriputta what is ignorance,<br />
					and to what extent is one ignorant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, friend, the untaught manyfolk<br />
					know not body,<br />
					know not the coming-to-pass of body,<br />
					know not the passing-away of body,<br />
					know not the way leading to the ceasing of body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">They know not perception,<br />
					know not the coming-to-pass of perception,<br />
					know not the passing-away of perception,<br />
					know not the way leading to the ceasing of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">They know not v,<br />
					know not the coming-to-pass of the activities,<br />
					know not the passing-away of the activities,<br />
					know not the way leading to the ceasing of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">They know not consciousness,<br />
					know not the coming-to-pass of consciousness,<br />
					know not the passing-away of consciousness,<br />
					know not the way leading to the ceasing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, friend, is ignorance,<br />
					and thus far is one ignorant."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Wisdom! Wisdom!' is the saying, friend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, friend Sāriputta what is wisdom,<br />
					and to what extent has one wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, friend, the well-taught Ariyan disciple knows body,<br />

					<p class="f4">Knows feeling,<br />

					<p class="f4">Knows consciousness,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward here in his abridgment has 'the way going to the passing away of body'. What I have used is his translation elsewhere. It is not the 'passing away' of body that is the knowledge required here, but the 'ending' (his 'cessation') of body such as to end it's further arisings and passings-away.</p>
