<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.135. Upon being asked, the venerable Sāriputta teaches the venerable Maha Kotthita the definition of 'blindness' and 'vision' in terms of understanding shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness, understanding their arising, understanding their passing-away, and understanding the walk to walk to bring about their end." />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />

					came to the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he thus addressed the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Ignorance! Ignorance!' is the saying, friend Koṭṭhita.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, friend Koṭṭhita what is ignorance,<br />
					and to what extent is one ignorant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, friend, the untaught manyfolk<br />

					know not the passing-away of consciousness,<br />
					know not the way leading to the ceasing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, friend, is ignorance,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Wisdom! Wisdom!' is the saying, friend Koṭṭhita.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward here in his abridgment has 'the way going to the passing away of body'. What I have used is his translation elsewhere. It is not the 'passing away' of body that is the knowledge required here, but the 'ending' (his 'cessation') of body such as to end it's further arisings and passings-away.</p>
