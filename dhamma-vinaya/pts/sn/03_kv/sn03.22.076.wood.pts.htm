					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					feels disgust at body,<br />

					<p class="f4">Feeling disgust<br />

					by that release<br />
					set free,<br />
					knowledge arises:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the freed man<br />

					these Arahants."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Well-farer having so said,<br />
					the Teacber said this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Ah, happy saints, the Arahants! In them no craving's seen.<br />
							The 'I' conceit is rooted up: delusion's net is burst.<br />
							Lust-free they have attained; translucent is the heart of them.<br />

							Knowing the fivefold mass, they roam the seven domains of good.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Worthy of praise and worthy they - sons of the Wake true-born,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">These mighty heroes follow on, exempt from fear and dread:<br />
							Lords of the tenfold potency,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> great sages tranquillized:<br />
							Best beings they in all the world; in them no craving's seen.<br />
							<a id="pg70"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></a> They've won the knowledge of adepts. This compound is their last.<br />
							That essence of the holy life<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> that have they made their own.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Unshaken by the triple modes,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> set free from birth to come,<br />
							The plane of self-control they've won, victorious in the world.<br />
							Upward or crossways or below<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> - no lure is found in them.<br />
							They sound aloud their lion's roar 'Supreme are they that wake.'"</p>
