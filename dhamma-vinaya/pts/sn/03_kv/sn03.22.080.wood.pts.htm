					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas, near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a> in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					after rebuking the Order of brethren in a certain matter,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					robed himself at early dawn,<br />
					took bowl and robe<br />
					and entered Kapilavatthu for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had gone his rounds for alms in Kapilavatthu<br />
					and had finished his early meal,<br />
					he went to Great Grove for noonday rest,<br />
					and plunging into Great Grove,<br />
					sat down for noonday rest<br />
					at the foot of a young vilva<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as he meditated in seclusion,<br />
					this train of thought arose in him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have now well established the Order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are here new brethren,<br />
					who have not long left the world,<br />
					late-comers into this Norm and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they behold me not,<br />
					maybe they will falter and fall away,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even as a tender calf<br />
					that beholds not his dam<br />
					falters and falls away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, verily, there are here new brethren,<br />
					who have not long left the world,<br />
					late-comers into this Norm and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they behold me not,<br />
					maybe they will falter and fall away,<br />
					even as tender seedlings<br />
					falter and fall away<br />
					for lack of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, verily, there are here new brethren,<br />
					who have not long left the world,<br />
					late-comers into this Norm and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they behold me not,<br />
					maybe they will falter and fall away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How now if I confer a boon<br />
					upon the Order of brethren,<br />
					even as I did aforetime?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Brahmā-Sahampati,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					being aware in thought<br />
					of the thought of the Exalted One,<br />
					just as a strong man <a id="pg78"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span></a><br />
					might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or bend his outstretched arm,<br />
					vanished even so from the Brahmā world<br />
					and appeared before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā-Sahampati,<br />
					drawing his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					raised hts joined hands to the Exalted One<br />
					and thus spake unto him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so it is, 0 Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so it is, 0 Well-farer!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well established by the Exalted One<br />
					is the Order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, verily, there are here new brethren,<br />
					who have not long left the world,<br />
					late-comers into this Norm and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they behold not the Exalted One,<br />
					maybe they will falter and fall away,<br />
					even as a tender calf<br />
					that beholds not his dam<br />
					falters and falls away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, verily, there are here new brethren,<br />
					who have not long left the world,<br />
					late-comers into this Norm and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they behold not the Exalted One,<br />
					maybe they will falter and fall away,<br />
					even as tender seedlings<br />
					falter and fall away for lack of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, verily, there are here new brethren,<br />
					who have not long left the world,<br />
					late-comers into this Norm and Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they behold not the Exalted One,<br />
					maybe they will falter and fall away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my lord, the Exalted One,<br />
					delight the Order of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my lord the Exalted One<br />
					admonish the Order of brethren!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as aforetime the Order of brethren<br />
					was favoured by the Exalted One,<br />
					so may he now confer a boon upon them."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Brahmā-Sahampati,<br />
					beholding the consent of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him by the right<br />
					and vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br />
					went to the Banyan Park,<br />
					and coming thither<br />
					sat down on a seat prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there<br />
					the Exalted One performed a mystic wonder in such wise<br />
					that the brethren should come unto him<br />
					singly<br />
					and in pairs<br />
					with timid mien.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So those brethren came to the Exalted One<br />
					singly<br />
					and in pairs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with timid mien;<br />
					and when they had come there<br />
					they saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the Exalted One thus spake unto those brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, brethren,<br />
					is the meanest<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> of callings -<br />
					this of an almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="abuse">A term of abuse</a> is this in the world to-day,<br />
					to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You scrap-gatherer!</p>

					<p class="f4">With bowl in hand you roam <a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> about.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis this calling<br />
					that is entered on<br />
					by those clansmen who are bent on [their] good<br />
					because of good,<br />
					not led thereto<br />
					by fear of kings,<br />
					by fear of robbers,<br />
					not because of debt,<br />
					not from fear,<br />
					not because they have no livelihood:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I,<br />
					fallen upon birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					fallen upon woe,<br />
					foredone with woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe some means of ending all this mass of woe<br />
					may be found.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, brethren, a clansman leaves the world,<br />
					and covetous is he in his desires,<br />
					fierce in his longing,<br />
					malevolent of heart,<br />
					of mind corrupt,<br />
					careless and unrestrained,<br />
					not quieted,<br />
					but scatter-brained,<br />
					and thoughtless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, brethren,<br />
					a torch from a funeral pyre,<br />
					lit at both ends,<br />
					and in the middle smeared with dung,<br />
					kindleth no fuel<br />
					either in village or in forest -<br />
					using such a figure<br />
					do I describe unto you this man,<br />
					for he has lost his home and wealth,<br />
					nor yet does he fulfil the duties of a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three evil ways of thought, brethren: -<br />
					thoughts of lust,<br />
					thoughts of ill-will,<br />
					thoughts of hurting.</p>

					<p class="f4">And these three evil ways of thought<br />
					cease utterly without remainder<br />
					in him whose heart abides established in the four stations of mindfulness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or who practises concentration<br />
					that is withdrawn from objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed, brethren,<br />
					is this practice of concentration<br />
					that is withdrawn from objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">This sort of concentration, brethren,<br />
					if practised and dwelt upon<br />
					is of great fruit,<br />
					of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these two views, brethren:<br />
					the view of coming-to-be<br />
					and the view of not coming-to-be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren,<br />
					the well-taught Axiyan disciple<br />
					asks himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there, I wonder,<br />
					aught in all the world<br />
					which I can cling to<br />
					without sin?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then he knows for certain:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No!</p>

					<p class="f4">There is naught in all the world<br />
					that I can cling to<br />
					without sin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to grasp<br />
					and cling to body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by that grasping of mine<br />

					and despair<br />
