<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya III: Khandha Vagga, Samyutta 22: Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 45. The Buddha explains that to view body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness as impermanent, to view that which is impermanent as painful, and to view that which is painful as not the self or an aspect of the self, is seeing things as they are. So seeing, if one turns the heart away from these things and releases the heart by not fueling self through thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence and blindness, the heart becomes steady, happy, untroubled and well and in this freedom, seeing freedom, one knows that rebirth is ended, lived is the godly life, done is duty's doing and there is no more being any sort of an 'it' at any sort of an 'atness'." />
