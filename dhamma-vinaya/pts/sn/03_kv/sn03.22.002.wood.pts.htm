					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying among the Sakkas<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at Devadaha,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a township of the Sakkas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					a number of westward-faring brethren<br />
					came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they sat there<br />
					they addressed the Exalted One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master, we wish to go to the western province,<br />
					and in the western province<br />
					to take up residence."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And have ye got leave, brethren,<br />
					from the venerable Sāriputta?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Master, we have not got leave<br />
					from the venerable Sāriputta."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brethren, do ye get leave<br />
					from the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">A wise man is Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the patron<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> of those brethren<br />
					who live the righteous life along with him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Master," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion, the venerable Sāriputta was seated<br />
					not far from the Exalted One,<br />
					under a cassia tree.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brethren, having welcomed and approved the <a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> words of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and departed by the right<br />
					and came to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon they greeted him with friendly words, and,<br />
					exchanging the compliments of courtesy,<br />
					sat down on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those brethren thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta,<br />
					we desire to go to the western province<br />
					and in the western province<br />
					to take up residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Master has permitted us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, there are those<br />
					who will be questioners<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> of a brother<br />
					who roams the various provinces<br />
					— Wise men of the nobles,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of the brahmins,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />

					and wanderers<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					— there are wise men, friends,<br />
					of an inquiring mind (who will ask):</p>

					<p class="f4">'What does the Teacher of your reverences dec1are,<br />
					what does he announce?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it may be, friends,<br />
					that your doctrines are well learned,<br />
					well grasped,<br />
					well thought over<br />
					and well understood:<br />
					so that, in answering,<br />
					you might be able<br />
					to repeat the views of the Exalted One<br />
					and not misrepresent the Exalted One<br />
					by uttering an untruth,<br />
					but rightly state your doctrine<br />
					in agreement with his doctrine,<br />
					so that one who is of his way of thinking<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					may not give grounds for reproach in stating it."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"We would come from far, friend,<br />
					to hear from the lips of the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					the meaning of this saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for us<br />
					if it would please the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					to state its meaning."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friends.<br />
					Do ye listen carefully.<br />
					Give heed and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br />
					replied those brethren to the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> Thus spake the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, there are those<br />
					who will ask a question of a brother<br />
					who roams the various provinces<br />
					— Wise men of the nobles,<br />
					of the brahmins,<br />
					among householders<br />
					and wanderers<br />
					— there are wise men, friends,<br />
					of an inquiring mind (who will ask):</p>

					<p class="f4">'What does the teacher of your reverences declare,<br />
					what does he announce?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus asked, friends,<br />
					thus should ye reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friends, our teacher is one who tells<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Upon this reply, friends,<br />
					there might be those<br />
					who would put a further question<br />
					— Wise men of the nobles,<br />
					of the brahmins,<br />
					among householders<br />
					and wanderers<br />
					— there are wise men, friends,<br />
					of an inquiring mind (who will ask):</p>

					<p class="f4">'But in what way does your reverences' teacher tell<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, friends,<br />
					thus should ye reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In body surely, friends,<br />
					our teacher tells<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust;<br />
					in feeling,<br />
					in perception,<br />
					in the activities,<br />
					in consciousness<br />
					does our teacher tell<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Upon this reply, friends,<br />
					there might be those<br />
					who would put a further question<br />
					— Wise men of the nobles,<br />
					of the brahmins,<br />
					among householders<br />
					and wanderers<br />
					— there are wise men, friends,<br />
					of an inquiring mind (who might ask):</p>

					<p class="f4">'But seeing what danger therein, friends,<br />
					does your reverences' teacher tell<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust in the body,<br />
					likewise in feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities<br />
					and consciousness?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, friends,<br />
					thus should ye make reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In body, friends,<br />
					he who is not rid of desire,<br />
					who is not rid of lust,<br />
					who is not rid of affection,<br />
					nor yet of thirst and fever and craving,<br />
					— owing to the unstable and changeful nature of body,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair<br />
					arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In feeling,<br />
					he who is not rid of desire,<br />
					who is not rid of lust,<br />
					who is not rid of affection,<br />
					nor yet of thirst and fever and craving,<br />
					— owing to the unstable and changeful nature of feeling,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair<br />
					arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In perception,<br />
					he who is not rid of desire,<br />
					who is not rid of lust,<br />
					who is not rid of affection,<br />
					nor yet of thirst and fever and craving,<br />
					— owing to the unstable and changeful nature of perception,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair<br />
					arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the activities,<br />
					he who is not rid of desire,<br />
					who is not rid of lust,<br />
					who is not rid of affection,<br />
					nor yet of thirst and fever and craving,<br />
					— owing to the unstable and changeful nature of the activities,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair<br />
					arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consciousness, he who is not rid of desire,<br />

					who is not rid of affection,<br />

					— owing to the1 unstable and changeful nature of consciousness,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair<br />
					<a id="pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> arise in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, friends, is the danger,<br />
					seeing which in body,<br />
					our teacher tells<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust in body;<br />
					so also in feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities<br />
					that, friends, is the danger,<br />
					seeing which in consciousness<br />
					our teacher tells<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust in consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Upon this reply, friends,<br />
					there might be those<br />
					who would put a further question<br />
					— Wise men of the nobles,<br />
					of the brahmins,<br />
					among householders<br />
					and wanderers<br />
					— there are wise men, friends,<br />
					of an inquiring mind (who might ask):</p>

					<p class="f4">'But seeing what profit therein<br />
					does your reverences' teacher tell<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust in the body,<br />
					in feeling,<br />
					in perception,<br />
					in the activities,<br />
					likewise in consciousness?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus questioned, friends,<br />
					thus should ye make reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In body, friends,<br />
					he who is rid of desire,<br />
					who is rid of lust,<br />
					who is rid of affection,<br />
					of thirst and fever and craving,<br />
					owing to the unstable and changeful nature of body,<br />
					sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe, lamentation and despair<br />
					do not arise in him;<br />
					so also with feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, friends, is the profit,<br />
					seeing which our teacher tells<br />
					of the restraining of desire and lust in body,<br />
					in feeling,<br />
					in perception,<br />
					in the activities<br />
					and in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, friends,<br />
					that in fostering evil states<br />
					and dwelling therein,<br />
					in this very life<br />
					he would live pleasantly,<br />
					unharassed and free<br />
					from life's fret and fever,<br />
					and, when body dissolves, after death<br />
					he may look for the abode of bliss<br />
					— this is not the putting away of evil states<br />
					that the Exalted One would approve.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, friends, inasmuch as<br />
					having fostered evil states<br />
					and dwelling therein,<br />
					in this very life<br />
					one would live painfully,<br />
					harassed, unfreed<br />
					from life's fret and fever,<br />
					and, when body dissolves, after death<br />
					one may look for the woeful state<br />
					— therefore does the Exalted One approve<br />
					of the putting away of evil states.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, friends,<br />
					that in fostering righteous states<br />
					and dwelling therein,<br />
					in this very life<br />
					one would live painfully,<br />
					harassed, unfreed<br />
					from life's fret and fever,<br />
					and, when body dissolves, after death<br />
					one may look for the woeful state<br />
					— this is not the way of fostering righteous states<br />
					that the Exalted One would approve.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg10"><span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span></a> But, friends,<br />
					inasmuch as having fostered righteous<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> states<br />

					— therefore does the Exalted One approve<br />
					of the accomplishing of righteous states.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and those brethren were delighted<br />
					and welcomed the words of the venerable Siriputta.</p>
