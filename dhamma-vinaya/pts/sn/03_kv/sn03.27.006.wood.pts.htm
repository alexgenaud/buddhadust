					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, the desire-and-lust that is in perception<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> of visible shape<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of sound<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of scent<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of savour<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of tangibles<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in perception of things<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren, when in a brother<br />
					the heart's corruption<br />
					in these six points<br />
					is put away,<br />
					and his heart is bent on renunciation,<br />
					then, compassed about with renunciation,<br />
					his heart is seen to be pliable<br />
					for penetrating those things<br />
					that are to be realized."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> As in <a href="sn03.26.006.wood.pts.htm">SN 3.26.6,</a> here Woodward has apparently mistakenly used 'consciousness' for 'perception.' This must be just a careless oversight as he uses 'perception' for the title, 'consciousness' for <a href="sn03.26.003.wood.pts.htm">§3</a> here and 'perception' for <a href="sn03.25.006.wood.pts.htm">§6</a> in the previous set. Doubt remains however because of the use here where he has changed his translation of <i>'rūpa'</i> to 'visible shape' which means he must have at least looked at this translation. I have changed the translation or corrected the mistake because it is pretty much a consensus opinion that the translation is 'perception.' See <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanna.htm">Glossology: <i>Saññā</i></a></p>
