<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya III: Khandha Vagga, Samyutta 22: Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 49. The Buddha advises Sona that making judgments about the superiority or inferiority or equality of the self with regard to others is just not seeing things as they are and then he leads him through the reasoning involved in seeing shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and sense-consciousness as not self because they are inconstant and that which is inconstant is painful and that so seeing one is free, and seeing freedom in freedom one knows rebirth has been left behind, the godly life has been lived, duty's doing is done and there will be no more being any sort of an 'it' at any place of 'atness'." />
