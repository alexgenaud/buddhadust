					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is not of you, brethren,<br />
					put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg32"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span></a> And what, brethren, is not of you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br />
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br />

					<p class="f4">Perception, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br />

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away<br />

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting it away<br />
					will be for your profit and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">'This man is gathering, burning us,<br />
					doing what he please with us?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, lord, this is not our self,<br />
					nor of the nature of self."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren, body is not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put it away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities, brethren, are not of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting them away<br />

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, brethren, is not of you.</p>

							<p>"there is here implied a self" No this is not implied by this. There is here the use of conventional speech. The Arahant who has put away the khandhas has also put away the idea of self in any of them, and it is said that outside of them there is no self. Putting away the idea that any of them are the self is how they are put away! And having put them away is the welfare and profit of the Arahant. Further, the process of putting away is not a snap fingers, done thing, it is a gradual process and any degree of putting away brings profit and welfare.</p>
