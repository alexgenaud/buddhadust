					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the reason, lord,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why a certain one,<br />
					when body breaks up after death<br />
					is reborn in the company of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, brother, a certain one is<br />
					a double-dealer in act,<br />
					a double-dealer in word<br />
					a double-dealer in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a one gives an offering of lamps and oil.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The womb-born <i>nāgas</i> are long-lived,<br />
					fair to see<br />
					and have much happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"0 that when body breaks up after death<br />
					I might be born in the company<br />
					of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>!"</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br />
					he is born in the company<br />
					of the womb-born <i>nāgas</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the reason, brother,<br />
					this is the cause<br />
					why a certain one,<br />
					when body breaks up after death<br />
					is reborn in the company of the womb-born <i>nāgas.</i>"</p>
