					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha<br />
					in Great Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Vakkali was staying in the Potter's shed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> being sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Vakkali called to his attendants, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, friends!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go ye to the Exalted One, and,<br />
					in my name worshipping at the feet of the Exalted One,<br />
					say unto <a id="pg102"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></a> him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the brother Vakkali is sick,<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus do ye say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well were it, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would visit brother Vakkali,<br />
					out of compassion for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br />
					replied those brethren to the venerable Vakkali,<br />
					and went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those brethren said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the brother Vakkali is sick<br />
					afflicted,<br />
					stricken with a sore disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">He worships at the feet of the Exalted one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it if the Exalted One<br />
					would visit brother Vakkali<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					went to visit the venerable Vakkali.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Vakkali saw the Exalted One coming,<br />
					while yet he was afar off,<br />
					and on seeing him<br />
					he stirred upon his bed.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Vakkali:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, Vakkali!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed!</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these seats made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit there."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One sat down<br />
					and said to the venerable Vakkkali:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Vakkali, I hope you are bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are enduring.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I am not bearing up.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not enduring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong pains come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not abate.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no sign of their abating,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg103"><span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span></a> "Have you any doubt, Vakkali?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you any remorse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, lord, I have no little doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have no little remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you not anything, Vakkali,<br />
					wherein to reproach yourself<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> as to morals?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, there is nothing wherein I reproach myself as to morals."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Vakkali, if that is so,<br />
					you must have some worry,<br />
					you must have something you regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time, lord,<br />
					I have been longing to set eyes on the Exalted One,<br />
					but I had not strength enough in this body<br />
					to come to see the Exalted one."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p13" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.087.pali.bd.htm#p13">13</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bps/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.087.wlsh.bps.htm#p13">bps</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.087.bodh.wp.htm#p13">bodh</a>]</span> "Hush, Vakkali!</p>

					<p class="f4">What is there in seeing this vile body of mine?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who seeth the Norm, Vakkali,<br />
					he seeth me:<br />
					he who seeth me, Vakkali,<br />
					he seeth the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, seeing the Norm, Vakkali,<br />
					one sees me:<br />
					seeing me,<br />
					one sees the Norm.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this what think you, Vakkali?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is body permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is feeling permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is perception permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are the activities permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is consciousness permanent, or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, Vakkali, he who thus seeth<br />
					feels disgust for body,<br />
					feels disgust for feeling,<br />
					for perception,<br />
					for the activities,<br />
					feels disgust for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So feeling disgust he is repelled;<br />
					being repelled, he is freed;<br />
					knowledge arises that in the freed<br />
					is the freed thing;<br />
					so that he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth;<br />
					lived is the righteous life;<br />
					done is my task;<br />
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					having thus taught the venerable Vakkali this lesson,<br />
					rose up and went away to Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br />
					the venerable Vakkali called to his attendants:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come ye hither, friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lift up my bed and go to Black Rock<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One spent the rest of that day and the night on Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the night was waning<br />
					two devas of exceeding beauty<br />
					caused the whole of Vulture's Peak to be lit up,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the other deva said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake those devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying they saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One,<br />
					when that night was spent,<br />
					called to the brethren:—</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come hither, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go ye to brother Vakkali, and say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vakkali,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to the brethren:</p>
