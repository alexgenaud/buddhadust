					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Ayojjhāya,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> on the bank of the nver Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as if, brethren,<br />
					this river Ganges should carry down<br />
					a huge lump of foam,<br />
					and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br />
					observe it<br />
					and look close into its nature.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing it,<br />
					ob- <a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> serving it<br />
					and looking close into its nature,<br />
					he would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in a lump of foam?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever body,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					which a brother sees,<br />

					and looks close into its nature,<br />
					he so seeing,<br />
					observing<br />
					and looking into the nature of it,<br />
					would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in a body?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, brethren, in autumn time<br />
					when the sky god rains down big drops,<br />
					a bubble rises on the water<br />
					and straightway bursts,<br />
					and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br />
					observe it,<br />
					look close into its nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing it,<br />
					observing it<br />
					and looking close into its nature,<br />
					he would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in a bubble on the water?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever feeling,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />

					he so seeing,<br />

					and looking into the nature of it,<br />
					would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in feeling?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, brethren,<br />
					in the last month of the dry season<br />
					at high noontide<br />
					there should be a mirage,<br />
					and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br />
					observe it,<br />
					look close into its nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing it,<br />
					observing it<br />
					and looking close into its nature,<br />
					he would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in a mirage?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever perception,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					which a brother sees,<br />
					observes<br />
					and looks close into its nature,<br />
					he so seeing,<br />
					observing<br />
					and looking into the nature of it,<br />
					would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in perception?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brethren, suppose a man should roam about<br />
					in need of heart of wood,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					searching for heart of wood,<br />
					looking for heart of wood,<br />
					and taking a sharp axe<br />
					should enter a forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sees a mighty plantain-trunk,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					straight up,<br />
					new grown,<br />
					of towering height.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He cuts it down at the root.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> Having cut it down at the root,<br />
					he chops it off at the top.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having chopped it off at the top,<br />
					he peels off the outer skin.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he peels off the outer skin,<br />
					he finds no pith<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> inside,<br />
					much less does he find heart of wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then suppose a keen-sighted man sees it,<br />
					observes it,<br />
					looks into the nature of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing it,<br />
					observing it<br />
					and looking close into its nature,<br />
					he would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren, could there be<br />
					in a plantain-trunk?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever activities,<br />
					be they past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					which a brother sees,<br />
					observes<br />
					and looks close into their nature,<br />
					he so seeing,<br />
					observing<br />
					and looking into the nature of them,<br />
					would find them empty,<br />
					he would find them unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find them without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be<br />
					in the activities?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brethren, suppose a juggler<br />
					or a juggler's apprentice<br />
					should spread a glamour<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> on the high road,<br />
					and a keen-sighted man should see it,<br />
					observe it,<br />
					look close into the nature of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing it,<br />
					observing it<br />
					and looking close into its nature,<br />
					he would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren, could there be<br />
					in a glamour?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, whatsoever consciousness,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					subtle or gross,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					which a brother sees,<br />
					observes<br />
					and looks close into its nature,<br />
					he so seeing,<br />
					observing<br />
					and looking into the nature of it,<br />
					would find it empty,<br />
					he would find it unsubstantial,<br />
					he would find it without essence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What essence, brethren,<br />
					could there be in consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren, he who thus sees<br />
					conceives disgust at body,<br />
					at feeling,<br />
					at perception,<br />
					at the activities,<br />
					at consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being disgusted<br />
					he is repelled by them;<br />
					by that repulsion he is released;<br />
					by that release he is set free;<br />
					knowledge arises:<br />
					in the freed man is the freed thing,<br />
					and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth;<br />
					lived is the righteous life;<br />
					done is the task;<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Well-Farer had thus spoken,<br />
					the Teacher added this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Like to a ball of foam this body is:<br />
							Like to a bubble blown the feelings are:<br />
							<a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> Like to a mirage unsubstantial<br />
							Perception: pithless as a plantain-trunk<br />
							The activities: a phantom, consciousness.<br />
							Thus hath declared the Kinsman of the Sun.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">However one doth contemplate (this mass)<br />
							And thoroughly investigate its form, -<br />
							To him, so seeing, empty, void it is.<br />
							Beginning with this body first of all: -<br />
							By his rich subtle wisdom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> it is shown.<br />
							'Reft of three things, life, heat and consciousness,<br />
							Behold it thrown aside. When 'tis cast off,<br />
							Discarded there it lies, a senseless thing,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Mere food for others. Such its lineage.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
							A babbling fantasy, a murderer:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Such is its name. No essence here is seen.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Thus should a brother, with an eager will.<br />
							Regard this mass. Mindful and self-possessed<br />
							By day, yea, day and night, let him cast off<br />
							All fetters, make a refuge of himself,<br />
							And act as if his head were all ablaze,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> Aspiring for the state that changeth not.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>
