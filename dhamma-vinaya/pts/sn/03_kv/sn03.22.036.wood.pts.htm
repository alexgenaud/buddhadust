					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<h4 class="ctr">I</h4>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, that brother thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well for me, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would teach me a doctrine in a few words,<br />
					so that hearing the teaching of the Exalted One<br />

					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(The Exalted One said):</p>

					<p class="f4">"That for which one has a bias,<br />
					one takes as measure.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That which one takes as measure,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I understand, 0 Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand, 0 Well-farer!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how far, brother, do you understand in full<br />
					the meaning of what I have thus concisely stated?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one cleave to body, lord,<br />
					that one takes as a measure.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That which he takes as a measure,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said! Well said, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well do you understand in full<br />

					<p class="f4">Then that brother welcomed the saying of the Exalted One,<br />
					and was pleased thereat,<br />
					and he rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">II.</h4>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon that brother,<br />
					living solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time attained that goal<br />
					for which the clansmen rightly leave home<br />
					for the homeless life,<br />
					even that unrivalled goal of righteous living;<br />
					attained it even in that very life:<br />
					and knowing it for himself,<br />
					realizing it for himself,<br />
					abode therein,<br />
					so that he came to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is my task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And that brother was now one of the saints.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> 'That body which one cleaves to ... perishes when the cleaving dies away.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward's abridgment leaves us without knowing how he would have constructed the following which is not identical to the previous sutta. I have reconstructed it as I believe he might have done.</p>
