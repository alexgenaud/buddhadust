<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.54. The Buddha explains that shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness are, like the five means for the propagation of plants, the five means for the propagation of consciousness. Shapes, sense-experience, perception, and own-making are like the earth. Delight is like water. By eliminating delight in shapes, sense-experience, perception and own-making, consciousness is not propagated and when not propagated it is set free." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are five sorts of seed, brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Root-seed,<br />
					trunk-seed,<br />
					seed from shoots,<br />
					seed from joints,<br />
					grain-seed,<br />
					making five in all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, brethren,<br />
					that these five sorts of seed are unbroken,<br />
					not rotten,<br />
					unspoiled by wind and heat,<br />
					capable of sprouting,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and happily planted,<br />
					but that <a id="pg47"><span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span></a> there is no soil<br />
					and no water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think ye, brethren,<br />
					that these five sorts of seed<br />
					would come to growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren,<br />
					that these five sorts of seed<br />
					are unbroken,<br />
					not rotten,<br />
					unspoiled by wind and heat,<br />
					capable of sprouting,<br />
					but not happily planted,<br />
					and that there were soil and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now would these five sorts of seed<br />
					come to growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely not, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, brethren,<br />
					suppose that these five sorts of seed<br />
					are unbroken,<br />
					not rotten,<br />
					unspoiled by wind and heat,<br />
					capable of sprouting,<br />
					and happily planted,<br />
					and that there is both soil and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now would these five sorts of seed<br />
					come to growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As the earth-element, brethren,<br />
					so should the four stations of consciousness be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the water-element, brethren,<br />
					so should the lure of lust be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the five sorts of seed, brethren,<br />
					so should consciousness and its cause be considered.</p>

					<p class="f4">By attachment to body, brethren,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					if it got a standing,<br />
					would stand.</p>

					<p class="f4">With body for its object,<br />
					with body for its platform,<br />
					seeking a means of enjoyment,<br />
					it would come by growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">By cleaving to feeling,<br />
					brethren,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					if it got a standing,<br />
					would stand.</p>

					<p class="f4">With feeling for its object,<br />
					with feeling for its platform,<br />
					seeking a means of enjoyment,<br />
					it would come by growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">By cleaving to perception,<br />
					brethren,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					if it got a standing,<br />
					would stand.</p>

					<p class="f4">With perception for its object,<br />
					with perception for its platform,<br />
					seeking a means of enjoyment,<br />
					it would come by growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">By cleaving to the activities,<br />
					brethren,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					if it got a standing,<br />
					would stand.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the activities for its object,<br />
					with the activities for its platform,<br />
					seeking a means of enjoyment,<br />
					it would come by growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were a man, brethren, to declare thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Apart from body,<br />
					apart from feeling,<br />
					apart from perception,<br />
					apart from the activities,<br />
					I will show forth the coming or the going,<br />
					or the decease<br />
					or the rebirth of consciousness,<br />
					or the growth,<br />
					the increase,<br />
					the abundance of consciousness -<br />
					to	do that were impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">If lust for body, brethren,<br />
					is abandoned by a brother,<br />
					by that abandonment of lust<br />
					its foothold is cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If lust for feeling, brethren,<br />
					is abandoned by a brother,<br />
					by that abandonment of lust<br />
					its foothold is cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If lust for perception, brethren, is abandoned by a brother,<br />
					by that abandonment of lust<br />
					its foothold is cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If lust for the activities, brethren, is abandoned by a brother,<br />
					by that abandonment of lust<br />
					its foothold is cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also, brethren, if lust for the consciousness-element be abandoned by a brother,<br />
					by that abandonment of lust<br />
					its foothold is cut off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby there is no platform for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without that platform<br />
					consciousness has no growth,<br />
					it generates no action and is freed:<br />
					by freedom it is steady:<br />
					by its steadiness it is happy:<br />
					owing to happiness it is not troubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being untroubled,<br />
					of itself it becomes utterly well,<br />
					so that it knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter."'</p>
