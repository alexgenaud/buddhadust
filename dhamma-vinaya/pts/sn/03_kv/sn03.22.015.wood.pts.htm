<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya III: Khandha Vagga, Samyutta 22: Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 15. The Buddha teaches that that which is impermanent is painful and that which is painful should not be regarded as the self. So seeing form, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness is sufficient to be repelled by them and that being repelled one is free." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is impermanent<br />
					that is suffering.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by body,<br />
					is repelled by feeling,<br />
					is repelled by perception,<br />
					is repelled by the activities<br />
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br />
					he lusts not<br />
					not lusting he is set free<br />
					in this freedom comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is my task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>

See <i>Pāli Dict.</i> s.v. which suggests 'ease' and 'dis-ease,' 'wealth and ilth,' 'well-being' and 'ill-being.' But all these words have now various significances. 'Ill-fare' is used in Elizabethan literature. Buddhaghosa defines the word at <i>V.M.</i> 461, and at p. 494 attempts its derivation (not very successfully) in <i>du,</i> 'mean, inferior'; 'khaɱ,' empty. But the underlying idea seems to be 'ill-put-together, temporary, unreal, unsatisfactory.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Expositor</i> i, 53,54, and note on next page; Mrs. Rhys Davids, <i>Bud. Psychology,</i> 1924, p. 83 <i>f.</i>'"</p>
