					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					rising up at early dawn,<br />
					<a id="pg190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span></a> robed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					entered Rājagaha to beg for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After begging straight on from house to house<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>' in Rājagaha he was eating his meal, leaning against a certain wall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wandering sister Pure-Face came up to the venerable Sāriputta and addressed him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"0 recluse, why do you eat looking downwards?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do nñt eat looking downwards, sister."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking upwards."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not eat looking upwards, sister."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not eat looking to the four quarters, sister."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the points between the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not eat, sister, looking to the points between the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then how, forsooth, how are you eating, recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">For when I question you<br />
					'0 recluse, why do you eat looking downwards?'<br />
					you answer:<br />
					'I do nñt eat looking downwards, sister.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I question you<br />
					'Then, recluse, you are eating looking upwards.'<br />
					you answer:<br />
					'I do not eat looking upwards, sister.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I question you<br />
					'Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the four quarters.'<br />
					you answer:<br />
					'I do not eat looking to the four quarters, sister.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I question you<br />
					'Then, recluse, you are eating looking to the points between the four quarters.'<br />
					you answer:<br />
					'I do not eat, sister, looking to the points between the four quarters.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br />
					get their living in a wrong way<br />
					by the practice of divination<br />
					and of such low arts, -<br />
					these, sister, are called<br />
					'recluses and brahmins who eat looking downwards.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br />
					get their living in a wrong way<br />
					by the practice of star-gazing<br />

					get their living in a wrong way<br />
					by the practice of sending messages<br />
					and going errands,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					such as these, sister, are called<br />
					'recluses and brahmins who eat looking to the four quarters.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> Whatsoever recluses and brahmins, sister,<br />

					<p class="f4">But I, sister, am one who gets his living<br />
					in no one of these ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rightly do I seek my food,<br />
					and rightly do I eat my food<br />
					when I have sought it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the wanderer Pure-Face<br />
					roamed from street to street<br />
					and from crossways to crossways<br />
					in Rājagaha<br />
					and thus proclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rightly do the recluses<br />
					who are sons of the Sakyan<br />
					win their food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blamelessly do the recluses<br />
					who are sons of the Sakyan<br />
					win their food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye give alms<br />
					to the recluses<br />
					who are sons of the Sakyan."</p>
