<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.27.5. The Buddha teaches that desire and lust for sense-experience born of eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact is a slime over the heart but where this desire and lust have been put away, the heart becomes maliable and fit for seeing the higher knowledge of the Dhamma." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren, the desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of eye-contact<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of ear-contact<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of nose-contact<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of tongue-contact<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of body-contact<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The desire-and-lust that is in feeling born of mind-contact<br />
					is a corruption of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brethren, when in a brother<br />
					the heart's corruption<br />
					in these six points<br />
					is put away,<br />
					and his heart is bent on renunciation,<br />
					then, compassed about with renunciation,<br />
					his heart is seen to be pliable<br />
					for penetrating those things<br />
					that are to be realized.'</p>
