					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the arising of body,<br />
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can a body<br />
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br />
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of feeling,<br />
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can feeling<br />
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br />
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of perception,<br />
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can perception<br />
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br />
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities are impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of the activities,<br />
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can the activities<br />
					which are compounded of the impermanent<br />
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of consciousness,<br />
					that also is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can consciousness<br />
					which is compounded of the impermanent<br />
					come to be permanent?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by body,<br />
					is repelled by feeling,<br />
					is repelled by perception,<br />
					is repelled by the activities<br />
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br />
					he lusts not<br />
					not lusting he is set free<br />
					in this freedom comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is my task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>
