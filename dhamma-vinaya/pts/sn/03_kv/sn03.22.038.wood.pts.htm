					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					In jeta Grove,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side,<br />

					<p class="f4">"If they were to ask you, Ānanda,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Ānanda, Ānanda,<br />
