					its Māras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					among the host of recluses and brahmins<br />

					<p class="f4">But as soon, brethren, as I thoroughly understood,<br />

					then, brethren, I knew for certain<br />
					that I was enlightened<br />
					with that supreme enlightenment<br />
					unsurpassed in the world,<br />
					with its devas,<br />
					its Māras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					among the host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					and of devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, indeed, the knowledge arose in me<br />
					and insight aröse in me: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sure is my release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my last birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no more rebirth for me now.'"</p>
