					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					In jeta Grove,<br />
					at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Surādha came to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Surādha thus addressed the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How in him who knows,<br />
					how in him who sees, lord,<br />
					in this body with its consciousness,<br />
					and likewise in all external objects,<br />
					has mind gone away from all ideas of 'I' and 'mine,'<br />
					and has passed beyond the ways of conceit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and is utterly liberated?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever material object, Surādha,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					gross or subtle,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br />
					this am not I;<br />
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br />
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever feeling, Surādha,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					gross or subtle,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br />
					this am not I;<br />
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br />
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever perception, Surādha,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					gross or subtle,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br />
					this am not I;<br />
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br />
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever activities, Surādha,<br />
					be they past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					gross or subtle,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br />
					this am not I;<br />
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br />
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever consciousness, Surādha,<br />
					be it past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					inward or outward,<br />
					gross or subtle,<br />
					low or high,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					one regards thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine;<br />
					this am not I;<br />
					this is not the Self of me' -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is seeing things as they really are,<br />
					by right insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Surādha,<br />
					in him who knows,<br />
					in him who sees, lord,<br />
					in this body with its consciousness,<br />
					and likewise in all external objects,<br />
					has mind gone away from all ideas of 'I' and 'mine,'<br />
					and has passed beyond the ways of conceit<br />
					and is utterly liberated."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Surādha gladly heard the words of the Exalted One<br />
					and welcomed them,<br />
					and he rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter the venerable Surādha,<br />
					dwelling solitary,<br />
					secluded,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and aspiring,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					attained that goal supreme of the righteous life,<br />
					to win which the clansmen rightly go forth from home to the homeless,<br />
					so that in that very life<br />
					of himself<br />
					he fully understood it,<br />
					realized it<br />
					and abode therein,<br />
					and knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Surādha was yet another of the Arahants.</p>
