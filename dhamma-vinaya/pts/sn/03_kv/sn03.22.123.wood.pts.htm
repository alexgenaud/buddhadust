<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.123. In a dialogue between Sāriputta and Maha Kotthita Sāriputta explains how by tracing out in mind the inconstance of, pain in, diseased nature of, cancerous nature of, knotty nature of, the thorny nature of, the horror of, the oppressive nature of, the otherness of, the corruptability of, the emptiness of, the non-self of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making, and consciousness the well-taught disciple can become a Streamwinner, the Streamwinner can become a Once-Returner, the Once-Returner can become a Non-Returner, the Non-Returner can become an Arahant and the Arahant can live pleasantly in this visible world." />

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a><br />
					and the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/mahakotthito.htm">Mahā-Koṭṭhita</a><br />
					were staying at Benares,<br />
					in Isipatana,<br />
					in the Deer-Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br />
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br />
					came to the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he thus addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sāriputta,<br />
					what are the conditions<br />
					that should be pondered with method<br />
					by a well-taught brother?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The five grasping-groups, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />
					are the conditions<br />
					which should be pondered with method<br />

					sick,<br />
					as an imposthume,<br />

					<p class="f4">What five groups?</p>

					<p class="f4">The group of body-grasping,<br />
