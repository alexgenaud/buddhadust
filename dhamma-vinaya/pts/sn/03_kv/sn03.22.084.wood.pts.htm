					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Tissa,<br />
					nephew to the Exalted One's father,<br />
					thus spoke to a number of brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, friends, my body has become as if drugged;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Sloth and torpor possess my heart:<br />
					joyless to me is the righteous life,<br />
					and I waver in the teachings."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon a number of brethren went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, those brethren said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the venerable Tissa,<br />

					<p class="f4">Sloth and torpor possess my heart:<br />
					joyless to me is the righteous life,<br />

					<p class="f4">At that, the Exalted One called to a certain brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, brother,<br />
					and in my name<br />
					bid hither brother Tissa, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Tissa, the Master would speak to you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br />
					said that brother in reply to the Exalted <a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> One,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Frieɱd Tissa, the Master would speak to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brother,"<br />
					said the venerable Tissa in reply to that brother,<br />
					and came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br />
					the Exalted One thus spake unto the venerable Tissa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as they say, Tissa,<br />
					that you said this to a number of brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truly, friends, my body has become as if drugged;<br />
