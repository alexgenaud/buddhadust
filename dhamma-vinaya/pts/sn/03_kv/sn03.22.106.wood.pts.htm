							<p>It was a wise decision of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society to transfer the publication of this work from the narrower limitations of space necessary to their Journal to the wider field of their series of monographs. Even in its present form, it is a little congested with all that it has to tell us. This egg is very full of meat. In a way, it is a throw-off or by-product of the distinguished author's fuller works on (not early, but) early-mediaeval Buddhist metaphysic, as it exists in Sanskrit and Tibetan documents. And, in some degree at least, the stimulus to the making of the by-product would appear to have been Professor and Mrs. Geiger's essay<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="xfn1" href="#xn1">1</a>]</sup></span> on the word <i>dhamma,</i> as it is found, not in those Sanskrit and Tibetan documents, but in Pali literature. The authors, namely, describe the excellent thesaurus of contexts and meanings they have assorted about the term Dhamma as having a "purely philological", or, rather, lexicographical object. They wish to give an exhaustive presentation of this "so-called central concept of Buddhist teaching" in its many different meanings. To Professor Stcherbatzky the one meaning it holds as a "central conception" is that which he has found it bear in the series of works containing the Abhidharma, or analytic and metaphysical categories and discussions of the Sarvastivadins, notably the <i>Abhidharmakośa</i> of Vasubandhu. All other meanings of <i>dhamma</i> he waves aside, as "not presenting any serious difficulty".</p>
