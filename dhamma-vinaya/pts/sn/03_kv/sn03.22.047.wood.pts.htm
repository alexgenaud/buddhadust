<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Samyutta Nikaya III: Khandha Vagga, Samyutta 22: Khandha Samyutta, Sutta 47. Whoever holds opinions concerning the self does so with the body, sense-experience, perception, own-making or consciousness in mind. With one or another of these things giving rise to thoughts of 'I am' or 'it is', there arises experience through the six senses and with the experience, the conviction that these things exist. Seeing this as it is, it can be let go and those convictions disappear." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those recluses and brahmins, brethren,<br />
					who regard the self in divers ways,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					regard it as the body-mass<br />
					of five factors based on grasping,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or as some one of these.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the untaught many-folk,<br />
					who discern not those that are Ariyans,<br />
					who are unskilled in the Ariyan doctrine,<br />
					untrained in the Ariyan doctrine,<br />
					who discern not those who are worthy ones,<br />
					who are unskilled in the worthy doctrine,<br />
					untrained in the worthy doctrine, —<br />
					regard body as the self,<br />
					self as possessed of body,<br />
					body as being in the self,<br />
					self as being in body;</p>

					<p class="f4">view feeling as the self<br />
					the self as possessed of feeling,<br />
					feeling as being in the self,<br />
					the self as being in feeling;</p>

					<p class="f4">view perception as the self<br />
					the self as possessed of perception,<br />
					perception as being in the self,<br />
					the self as being in perception;</p>

					<p class="f4">view the activities as the self<br />
					the self as possessed of the activities,<br />
					the activities as being in the self,<br />
					the self as being in the activities;</p>

					<p class="f4">view consciousness as the self<br />
					the self as possessed of consciousness,<br />
					consciousness as being in the self,<br />
					the self as being in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this is the view.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has come to him (to think): 'I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when it has come to anyone<br />
					to think 'I am,'<br />
					there comes to pass a descent<br />
					of the five feeling-faculties<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the seeing-faculty,<br />
					the hearing-faculty,<br />
					the smelling-faculty,<br />
					the tasting-faculty,<br />
					the touching-faculty.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> Mind is the result,<br />
					mind-states<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> are the result,<br />
					the ignorarnce-element is the result.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by the feeling<br />
					born of contact with ignorance,<br />
					there comes to the untaught many-folk (the view),<br />
					'I am';</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes (the view),<br />
					'this same I am;'</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes (the view),<br />
					'things will be';</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes the view,<br />
					'things will not be';<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">there comes the view,<br />
					'things will have body';</p>

					<p class="f4">the view,<br />
					'things will be bodyless';</p>

					<p class="f4">there comes the view,<br />
					'things will be conscious';</p>

					<p class="f4">the view,<br />
					'things will be unconscious';</p>

					<p class="f4">the view,<br />
					'things will be neither conscious nor unconscious.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just therein, brethren,<br />
					that the five feeling-faculties persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">But herein for the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					ignorance is put away<br />
					and knowledge arises.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Along with the fading away of ignorance<br />
					and the arising of knowledge<br />
					there comes to him no view that<br />
					'I am,'<br />
					that<br />
					'this same I am,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will be,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will not be,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will have body,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will not have body,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will be conscious,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will be unconscious,'<br />
					that<br />
					'things will be neither conscious nor unconscious.'"</p>
