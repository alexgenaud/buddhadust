					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.28.005.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Sāriputta was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					rising at early dawn,<br />
					robed himself,<br />
					took bowl and robe<br />
					and entered Sāvatthī to beg for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After going his begging-rounds in Sāvatthī<br />
					and returning from begging<br />
					he ate his meal<br />
					and drew near Dark Grove<br />
					for noonday rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Plunging into Dark Grove,<br />
					he sat down at the foot of a tree<br />
					for noonday rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					rising at eventide from his solitude,<br />
					went to <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a><br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda<br />
					saw the venerable Sāriputta coming,<br />
					while yet he was far off,<br />
					and beholding the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					he thus spake to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Calm are your senses, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					clear and translucent<br />
					the colour of your face.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what mood<br />
					has the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					been spending this day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, passing utterly beyond<br />
					the consciousness of shape and form,<br />
					by the ending of the consciousness of resistance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by not attending to the consciousness of diversity,<br />
					I have attained<br />
					and have been dwelling in the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					'Infinite is space.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To me thus, friend,<br />
					the thought never came:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br />
					who am attaining the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br />
					who have attained the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br />
					who have emerged from the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					"Infinite is space."'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely for a long time<br />
					have leanings to I-making,<br />
					to mine-making<br />
					and to vanity<br />
					been well rooted out from the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why it occurs not<br />
					to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br />
					who am attaining the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br />
					who have attained the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					"Infinite is space."'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I<br />
					who have emerged from the sphere of the infinity of space, realizing:<br />
					"Infinite is space."'"</p>
