The Buddha teaches that because of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and sense-consciousness the view 'An' not 'were this', and not ''tis my', were no 'will be', nor 'will be mine' arises and that the escape therefrom is through seeing the inconstance, pain, and non-self in these things." />

					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br />
					by clinging to what,<br />
					depend ing upon what,<br />
					does this view arise:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Were I not then,<br />

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root<br />
