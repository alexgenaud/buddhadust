					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Body, brethren, is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the arising of body,<br />
					that also is ill.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can a body<br />
					which is compounded of ill<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					come to be ease?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of feeling,<br />
					that also is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can feeling<br />
					which is compounded of ill<br />
					come to be ease?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of perception,<br />
					that also is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can perception<br />
					which is compounded of ill<br />
					come to be ease?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The activities are ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of the activities,<br />
					that also is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can the activities<br />
					which are compounded of ill<br />
					come to be ease?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the cause,<br />
					that which is the condition<br />
					of the uprising of consciousness,<br />
					that also is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, brethren, can consciousness<br />
					which is compounded of ill<br />
					come to be ease?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seeing, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by body,<br />
					is repelled by feeling,<br />
					is repelled by perception,<br />
					is repelled by the activities<br />
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br />
					he lusts not<br />
					not lusting he is set free<br />
					in this freedom comes insight<br />
					that it is a being free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he realizes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is destroyed,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is my task,<br />
					for life in these conditions<br />
					there is no hereafter.'"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Here especially the translation of <i>dukkha-sambhūtaɱ,</i> 'ill-put together,' will better bring out the idea of a compost. The universe would seem to be 'bungled' by its causes, as 'Nature trying her 'prentice band,' or 'created by some lesser god,' as Tennyson puts it in <i>The Idylls of the Kinq.</i> It is an experiment. This significance of 'ill-state' is suggested to me by Mr. J. van Manen. The phrase <i>sukaɱ viharati,</i> 'lives at ease,' means 'the miad-feeling-body-compound,' works perfectly, like a well-made and well-oiled machine.</p>
