					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being what, brethren,<br />
					by clinging to what, adhering<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> to what<br />
