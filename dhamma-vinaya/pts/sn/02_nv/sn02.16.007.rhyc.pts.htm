<meta name="description" content="The Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 16: Kassapa Samyuttam), Sutta 7. Maha Kassapa describes the states which amount to decline in the bhikkhus and which make the bhikkhus hard to exhort and the states which amount to advancement and which make them easy to exhort. The Buddha confirms his analysis." />

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br />

					<p class="f4">They are intractable;<br />
