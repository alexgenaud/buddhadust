					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be ye comparable to the moon, brethren,<br />
					when ye go among the families,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					drawing back<br />
					in both heart and demeanour,<br />
					ever as new-comers<br />
					unobtrusive among the families.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man would contemplate a decayed well,<br />
					or a precipice,<br />
					or a river-swamp,<br />
					drawing back<br />
					in both heart and demeanour,<br />
					even so be ye among the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren,<br />
					is comparable to the moon<br />
					when he goes among the families,<br />
					drawing back<br />
					in both heart and demeanour,<br />
					ever as a new-comer<br />
					unobtrusive among the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think ye, brethren, as to that?</p>

					<p class="f4">What manner of brother<br />
					is worthy to go among the families?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br />
					if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will bear it in mind.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One waved his hand in space.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as this hand, brethren,<br />
					does not sink down in space,<br />
					nor is seized,<br />
					nor bound,<br />
					even so that brother, whose heart<br />
					when he <a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> goes among the families<br />
					does not sink down,<br />
					or get seized<br />
					or bound,<br />
					but thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them who desire gains,<br />
					gain!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them who desire merit,<br />
					work merit!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let a man be pleased and joyous,<br />
					at the gains of others,<br />
					even as he is pleased and joyous<br />
					at his own gains!'</p>

					<p class="f4">This manner of brother<br />
					is worthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren,<br />
					when he goes among the families<br />
					does not let his heart sink down,<br />
					or get seized,<br />
					or bound.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them who desire gains,<br />
					gain!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them who desire merit,<br />
					work merit!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let a man be pleased and joyous<br />
					at the gains of others,<br />
					even as he is pleased and joyous<br />
					at his own gains!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a brother, brethren,<br />
					is worthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think ye, brethren,<br />
					as to this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what manner of brother<br />
					is the teaching of doctrine impure?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what manner of brother<br />
					is the teaching of the doctrine pure?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord,<br />
					things have the Exalted One as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, indeed, were it<br />
					if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will bear it in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brethren, listen,<br />
					give your mind thoroughly,<br />
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br />
					they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Any brother, brethren,<br />
					who teaches doctrine with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 that they may hear my doctrine,<br />
					and hearing it may be satisfied,<br />
					and being satisfied<br />
					may give expression to their satisfaction!'</p>

					<p class="f4">of this manner of brother<br />
					the teaching of doctrine is impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that brother who teaches doctrine to others<br />
					with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 that they may hear my doctrine, -<br />
					for it is the doctrine<br />
					which the Exalted One hath so well declared,<br />
					relating to the present,<br />
					not a matter of time;<br />
					the doctrine that says:<br />
					"Come, see!"<br />
					that leads on,<br />
					that is to be understood by the wise<br />
					each man for himself, -<br />
					and hearing it,<br />
					may acknowledge the doctrine,<br />
					and acknowledging it,<br />
					may practise<br />
					that they may so attain!'</p>

					<p class="f4">he thus teaches doctrine to others<br />
					because of the fair order of the Norm,<br />
					he teaches doctrine to others<br />
					out of pity,<br />
					out of caring for them,<br />
					<a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> because of his compassion for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such manner of brother<br />
					the teaching of doctrine is very pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren, teaches the doctrine<br />
					with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 that they may hear my doctrine, -<br />
					for it is the doctrine<br />
					which the Exalted One hath so well declared,<br />
					relating to the present,<br />
					not a matter of time;<br />
					the doctrine that says:<br />
					"Come, see!"<br />
					that leads on,<br />
					that is to be understood by the wise<br />
					each man for himself, -<br />
					and hearing it,<br />
					may acknowledge the doctrine,<br />
					and acknowledging it,<br />
					may practise<br />
					that they may so attain!'</p>

					<p class="f4">he thus teaches doctrine to others<br />
					because of the fair order of the Norm,<br />
					he teaches doctrine to others<br />
					out of pity,<br />
					out of caring for them,<br />
					because of his compassion for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such manner of brother<br />
					the teaching of doctrine is very pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily by Kassapa, brethren,<br />
					will I exhort you,<br />
					or by one like Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">By them exhorted<br />
					ye are to practise<br />
					that ye may so attain.</p>
