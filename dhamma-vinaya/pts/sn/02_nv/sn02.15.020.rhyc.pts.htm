					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					on Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br />
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the running on, the faring on,<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br />
					when this Mount Vipula<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was given the name East Ridge.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time<br />
					the people [here] were given the name of Tivaras,<br />
					and the measure of their life<br />
					was forty thousand years.</p>

					<p class="f4">It took those Tivaras <a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> four days<br />
					to climb Mount East Ridge<br />
					and four days to descend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Kakusandha,<br />
					Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme,<br />
					had arisen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br />
					Vidhura and Sañjīva,<br />
					a comely pair.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Behold, brethren,<br />
					how both the name of this hill has disappeared,<br />
					how those people have died<br />
					and how that Exalted One<br />
					has passed utterly away!</p>

					<p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br />
					are the things of this world,<br />
					so transient are they,<br />
					so comfortless are they.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />
					for you to feel repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br />
					when this Mount Vipula<br />
					was given the name of Vankaka.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the people [here]<br />
					were given the name of Rohitassas,<br />
					and the measure of their life<br />
					was thirty thousand years.</p>

					<p class="f4">It took those Rohitassas<br />
					three days to climb Mount Vankaka<br />
					and three days to descend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Konāgamana,<br />
					Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme,<br />
					had arisen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br />
					Bhiyyosa and Uttara,<br />
					a comely pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Behold, brethren,<br />
					how both the name of this hill has disappeared,<br />
					how those people have died<br />
					and how that Exalted One<br />
					has passed utterly away!</p>

					<p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br />
					are the things of this world,<br />
					so transient are they,<br />
					so comfortless are they.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />
					for you to feel repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br />
					when this Mount Vipula<br />
					was given the name of Fairside.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the people [here]<br />
					were given the name of Suppiyas,<br />
					and the measure of their life<br />
					was twenty thousand years.</p>

					<p class="f4">It took those Suppiyas<br />
					two days to climb Mount Fairside<br />
					and two days to descend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Kassapa,<br />
					Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme<br />
					had arisen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br />
					Tissa and Bhāradvāja,<br />
					a comely pair.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> Behold, brethren,<br />

					for you to feel repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, brethren, to this Mount Vipula<br />
					has come just the name 'Vipula.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, brethren, to these people<br />
					has come just the name 'Magadhese'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The measure of the age of the Magadhese<br />
					is small,<br />
					very limited,<br />
					fleeting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who lives long<br />
					lives for a hundred years<br />
					or but little more.</p>

					<p class="f4">The men of Magadha<br />
					climb Mount Vipula<br />
					in a little while,<br />
					descend it in a little while.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, brethren,<br />
					I have arisen in the world,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have a pair of disciples as chief,<br />
					Sāriputta and Moggallāna,<br />
					a comely pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will come a time, brethren,<br />
					when both the name of this hill will disappear,<br />
					when these people will die<br />
					and when I shall pass utterly away.</p>

					<p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br />
					are the things of this world,<br />
					so transient are they,<br />
					so comfortless are they.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />
					for you to feel repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this;<br />
					the Wellfarer so speaking,<br />
					the Master spake this further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">East Ridge this mountain for the Tivaras,<br />
							And Crooked Crest for Rohitassa folk,<br />
							Fairside its name among the Suppiyas,<br />
							Now for the Magadhese't is Vipula.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Alas! impermanent is all this world.<br />
							Growth is its very nature and decay.<br />
							Things spring to being and again they cease.<br />
							Happy the mastery of them and the peace.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
