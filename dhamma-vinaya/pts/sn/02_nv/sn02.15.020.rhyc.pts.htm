					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					on Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br />
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the running on, the faring on,<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br />
					when this Mount Vipula<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was given the name East Ridge.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time<br />
					the people [here] were given the name of Tivaras,<br />
					and the measure of their life<br />
					was forty thousand years.</p>

					<p class="f4">It took those Tivaras <a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> four days<br />
					to climb Mount East Ridge<br />
					and four days to descend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Kakusandha,<br />
					Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme,<br />
					had arisen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br />
					Vidhura and Sañjīva,<br />
					a comely pair.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Behold, brethren,<br />
					how both the name of this hill has disappeared,<br />
					how those people have died<br />
					and how that Exalted One<br />
					has passed utterly away!</p>

					<p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br />
					are the things of this world,<br />
					so transient are they,<br />
					so comfortless are they.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />
					for you to feel repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be liberated therefrom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">There was once a time, brethren,<br />
					when this Mount Vipula<br />
					was given the name of Vankaka.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the people [here]<br />
					were given the name of Rohitassas,<br />

					was thirty thousand years.</p>

					<p class="f4">It took those Rohitassas<br />
					three days to climb Mount Vankaka<br />
					and three days to descend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Konāgamana,<br />
					Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme,<br />
					had arisen in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he had a pair of disciples as chief,<br />

					<p class="f4">It took those Suppiyas<br />

					<p class="f4">He who lives long<br />

					<p class="f4">But I have a pair of disciples as chief,<br />

					a comely pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will come a time, brethren,<br />
					when both the name of this hill will disappear,<br />
					when these people will die<br />
					and when I shall pass utterly away.</p>

					<p class="f4">So impermanent, brethren,<br />
