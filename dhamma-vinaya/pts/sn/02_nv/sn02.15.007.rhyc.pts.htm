					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now many brethren came to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and took seats at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated they said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How many aeons, lord, have passed and gone by?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg123"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span></a> "Many, brethren, are the aeons passed and gone by.</p>

					<p class="f4">Them it is not easy to count up:<br />
					so many aeons,<br />
					so many hundreds,<br />
					so many thousands,<br />
					so many hundred thousand aeons."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can it be done, lord, by a parable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can, brethren," said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose that there were four disciples<br />
					who went on living here for a century,<br />
					and they were to recollect each day<br />
					a hundred thousand aeons.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The aeons should be just recalled by them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at the lapse of the century<br />
					they were to die.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so many aeons, brethren,<br />
					have passed and gone by.</p>

					<p class="f4">Them it is not easy to count up:<br />
					so many aeons,<br />
					so many hundreds,<br />
					so many thousands,<br />
					so many hundred thousand aeons."</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the faring on, running on,<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br />
					have ye been suffering ill,<br />
					have ye been suffering pain,<br />
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br />
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />
					for you to be repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>
