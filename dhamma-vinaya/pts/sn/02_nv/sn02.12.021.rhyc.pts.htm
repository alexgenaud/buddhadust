					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a><br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br />
					endowed with the ten powers,<br />
					and the four confidences,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					claims the Place of the Bull;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he roars the Lion's Roar amid the congregations;<br />
					he turns the Divine Wheel,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is material shape,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is feeling,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is perception,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such are activities,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is consciousness,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This' being,<br />
					'that' becomes;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises;<br />
					this not being,<br />
					that becomes not;<br />
					from the ceasing of this,<br />
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say,<br />
					conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br />
					conditioned by sense contact,<br />
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br />
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br />
					conditioned by craving grasping,<br />
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br />
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br />
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br />
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br />
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br />
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br />
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br />
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br />
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br />
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br />
					from ceasing of birth,<br />
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>
