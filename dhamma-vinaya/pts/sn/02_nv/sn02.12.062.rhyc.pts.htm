<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 6. Rukkha Vagga), Sutta 62. The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he describes how it is that consciousness arises through contact, sense-experience and perception and that it is by perceiving that that detachment leads to freedom and the knowledge of freedom." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, brethren,<br />
					might well be repelled by this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					might cease to fancy it<br />
					and wish to be free from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Seen is the growth and decay of this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					the taking on<br />
					and the laying down of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence well might the manyfolk be repelled by it,<br />
					cease to fancy it,<br />
					and wish to be free from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet this, brethren, that we call thought,<br />
					that we call mind,<br />
					that we call consciousness,<br />
					by this the untaught manyfolk are not able to feel repelled,<br />
					they are not able to cease fancying it<br />
					or to be freed from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day, brethren,<br />
					has it been for the uneducated manyfolk<br />
					that to which they cleave,<br />
					that which they call 'mine,'<br />
					that which they wrongly conceive thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is mine; this I am; this is my spirit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence the untaught manyfolk<br />
					are not able to feel repelled by it,<br />
					are not able to cease fancying it,<br />
					are not able to be freed from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were better, brethren,<br />
					if the untaught manyfolk approached this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					as the self rather than the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Seen is it, brethren, how this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					persists for a year,<br />
					<a id="pg66"><span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span></a> persists for two years,<br />
					persists for three,<br />
					four,<br />
					five,<br />
					ten,<br />
					twenty,<br />
					thirty years,<br />
					persists for forty,<br />
					for fifty years,<br />
					persists for a hundred years<br />
					and even longer.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this, brethren, that we call thought,<br />
					that we call mind,<br />
					that we call consciousness,<br />
					that arises as one thing,<br />
					ceases as another,<br />
					whether by night or by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of a contact which makes for pleasant feeling, brethren,<br />
					pleasant feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the ceasing of that contact which makes for pleasant feeling,<br />
					the pleasant feeling, -<br />
					which had arisen because of the contact making for pleasant feeling, -<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of a contact which makes for painful feeling, brethren,<br />
					painful feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the ceasing of that contact which makes for painful feeling,<br />
					the painful feeling, -<br />
					which had arisen because of the contact making for painful feeling, -<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of a contact which makes for neutral feeling, brethren,<br />
					neutral feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the ceasing of that contact which makes for neutral feeling,<br />
					the neutral feeling, -<br />
					which had arisen because of the contact making for neutral feeling, -<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if from the adjusted friction of two sticks,<br />
					heat is born,<br />
					a spark is brought forth,<br />
					but from the separating<br />
					and withdrawing<br />
					of just those two sticks,<br />
					the heat which was consequent,<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so because of a contact which makes for pleasant feeling, brethren,<br />
					pleasant feeling arises,<br />
					from the ceasing of that contact which makes for pleasant feeling,<br />
					the pleasant feeling, -<br />
					which had arisen because of the contact making for pleasant feeling, -<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched;</p>

					<p class="f4">because of a contact which makes for painful feeling, brethren,<br />
					painful feeling arises,<br />
					From the ceasing of that contact which makes for painful feeling,<br />
					the painful feeling, -<br />
					which had arisen because of the contact making for painful feeling, -<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched;</p>

					<p class="f4">because of a contact which makes for neutral feeling, brethren,<br />
					neutral feeling arises,<br />
					From the ceasing of that contact which makes for neutral feeling,<br />
					the neutral feeling, -<br />
					which had arisen because of the contact making for neutral feeling, -<br />
					that ceases,<br />
					that is quenched.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seeing, brethren,<br />
					the well taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by contact,<br />
					is repelled by feeling,<br />
					is repelled by perception,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is repelled by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br />
					he is not attracted by them,<br />
					unattracted he is set free,<br />
					and the knowledge comes in freedom<br />
					about freedom!</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows that birth is perished,<br />
					that the divine life is lived,<br />
					done that which was to be done,<br />
					no hereafter to these conditions!</p>
