<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 6. Rukkha Vagga), Sutta 70. Susima enters the order to learn the secret of Gotama's ability to generate respect and donatives. There he hears about bhikkhus gaining Arahantship and quesions them about super-normal powers. These bhikkhus tell him they have no super-normal powers and have been awakened through wisdom. Questioning the Buddha about this he learns to appreciate the Dhamma and confesses his earlier bad intentions." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Exalted One was honoured,<br />
					revered,<br />
					beloved,<br />
					ministered unto<br />
					and reverently welcomed;<br />
					and he was obtaining supplies of the requisites<br />
					for clothing,<br />
					sustenance,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medicaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was also true<br />
					of the Order of the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the heretical Wanderers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> were unhonoured,<br />
					unrevered,<br />
					not beloved<br />
					nor ministered unto,<br />
					not reverently welcomed<br />
					nor obtaining supplies of the requisites<br />
					for clothing,<br />
					sustenance,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medicaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Susīma the Wanderer was dwelling at Rājagaha<br />
					with a great company of Wanderers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that company spake thus to Susīma the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, friend Susīma,<br />
					live you the divine life<br />
					under the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have learnt his Norm<br />
					you will tell it to us.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we have learnt that Norm<br />
					we will preach it to the laity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus shall we become honoured,<br />
					revered,<br />
					beloved,<br />
					ministered unto<br />
					and reverently welcomed,<br />
					and we shall obtain supplies of the requisites<br />
					for clothing,<br />
					sustenance,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medicaments."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friends!"<br />
					responded Susīma the Wanderer<br />
					to his <a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> company,<br />
					and he went into the presence of the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					greeted him<br />
					and exchanged the compliments of courtesy and friendship<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Susīma the Wanderer spake thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I desire, friend Ānanda,<br />
					to live the divine life<br />
					under this Norm and Discipline."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda took Susīma the Wanderer<br />
					into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this is Susīma the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I desire, friend Ānanda,<br />
					to live the divine life<br />
					under this Norm and Discipline.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br />
					ordain<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Susīma."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Susīma the Wanderer obtained admission and ordination<br />
					in the Order of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					many brethren in the Order declared Aññā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					[with the confession]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We know that perished is birth,<br />
					lived is the divine life,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is nothing further in these conditions."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Susīma heard<br />
					that many brethren in the Order had declared Aññā,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We know that perished is birth,<br />
					lived is the divine life,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is nothing further in these conditions."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma went to those brethren<br />
					and greeting them,<br />
					and exchanging the compliments of courtesy and friendship,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he spake thus to those brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true what they say<br />
					that the venerable ones have declared Aññā under the Exalted One,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We know that perished is birth,<br />
					lived is the divine life,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is nothing further in these conditions?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg86"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></a> "Then surely you venerable ones,<br />

						<p><a id="what?">At this point</a> the PTS Pali has the following which, in a footnote is said to appear only in the S<sup>I.3</sup> manuscript:</p>

						<p><i>24. "Ettha dāni āyasmanto,||<br />

						[idan te āvuso api pana tumhe āyasmanto evaɱ jānantā evam passantā ye te santā vimokhā atikamma rūpe arūppā te kāyena passitvā viharathā" ti.</i>|| ||</p>

						<p><i>Idaɱ no āvuso.</i>|| ||</p>

						<p>25. <i>Kathan" ti?</i>|| ||</p>

						<p>Translated by Mrs. Rhys Davids with the incomprehensible:</p>

						<p>"Now here, venerable ones,<br />
						is both your replying<br />
						and your non-attainment of these things?"</p>

						<p>"There is none, friend."</p>

						<p>"How is that?"</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<hr />

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<p>Where the BJT and CSCD have:</p>

						<p><i>"Ettha dāni āyasmanto,||<br />
						idañ ca veyyā-karaṇaɱ imesañ ca dhammānaɱ asamāpatti.</i>|| ||</p>

						<p><i>Idaɱ no āvuso kathan" ti?</i>|| ||</p>

						<p>Translated by Bhk. Thanissaro as:</p>

						<p>"So just now, friends, didn't you make that declaration without having attained any of these Dhammas?"</p>

						<p>And translated by Bhk. Bodhi as:</p>

						<p>"Here now, venerable ones: this answer and the nonattainment of those states, how could this be, friends?"</p>

						<p>&nbsp;</p>

						<hr />

						<p>&nbsp;</p>
							
							<p>I suggest that what is the case here is that the fragment present in the S<sup>I.3</sup> manuscript represents what was an abridgment where Susīmaā is to repeat the entire series of questions and answers: When asked X you responded Y. Then to be followed with: How is this to be understood, that you claim  that you have attained <i>añña</i> but you deny you have attained these things? This would follow the practice found in many other cases in the suttas. This form needs to be followed also in the conclusion made by Gotama below.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now here, venerable ones,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> We have been freed by insight,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> friend Susīma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not know fully<br />

					<p class="f4">It would be well if the venerable ones<br />
					were to state it so that I might come to know fully<br />
					the matter they have stated concisely."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether you know it, friend Susīma,<br />
					or whether you do not know it,<br />
					we have been freed by insight."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Susīma rising from his seat<br />
					went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the venerable Susīma so far as he had conversed with those brethren<br />
					told all to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"First, Susīma, [comes] knowledge of the law of cause [and effect],<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"I do not know fully<br />

					<p class="f4">It would be well, lord,<br />

					the matter he has stated concisely."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether you come to know it, Susīma,<br />
					or whether you do not,<br />
					first comes knowledge of the law of cause [and effect],<br />
					afterwards comes knowledge about <i>Nibbāna.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, Susīma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the body<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent, is it painful or pleasant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Painful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But that which is impermanent,<br />
					painful,<br />
					changeable by nature,<br />
					do we well to contemplate it as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> "Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">of perception,</p>

					<p class="f4">of activities,</p>

					<p class="f4">of consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, Susīma, whatsoever body,<br />
					past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					internal or external,<br />
					coarse or fine,<br />
					mean or lofty,<br />
					far or near -<br />
					of all body to say it is not mine,<br />
					I am not it,<br />
					it is not my spirit: -<br />
					so is this to be regarded by right insight<br />
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so too are feeling,</p>

					<p class="f4">perception,</p>

					<p class="f4">activities,</p>

					<p class="f4">consciousness to be regarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">So beholding, Susīma,<br />
					the well taught Ariyan disciple feels repulsion at body,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					activities,<br />
					consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling repulsion he is not attracted by them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unattracted he is set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge comes to him freed as to being freed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he knows that birth is perished,<br />
					that the divine life is lived,<br />
					done is what was to be done;<br />
					there is nothing further of these conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Old age and dying are conditioned by birth:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is conditioned by becoming:</p>

					<p class="f4">Susīma, seest thou this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Becoming is conditioned by grasping:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When becoming ceases, birth ceases:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Transgression, lord, hath caused me,<br />
					so foolish,<br />
					so stupid,<br />
					so wrong am I,<br />
					to transgress.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have gained admission<br />
					as a thief of the Norm<br />
					into this Norm and Discipline<br />
					so well set forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One, lord,<br />
					accept this my confession<br />
					for my restraining myself in future."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, Susīma, transgression hath caused thee,<br />
					so foolish,<br />
					so stupid,<br />
					so wrong art thou,<br />
					to transgress,<br />
					who didst gain admission<br />
					as a thief of the Norm<br />
					into this Norm and Discipline<br />
					so well set forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, Susīma,<br />
					they had caught a robber,<br />
					an evildoer,<br />
					and showed him to the prince saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, this is a robber, an evildoer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inflict on him what penalty you wish.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the prince were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go, men, bind this man's arms behind him with a strong rope,<br />
					shave him bald,<br />
					lead him around in a tumbril<br />
					with a tam-tam<br />
					from street to street,<br />
					from crossroads to crossroads,<br />
					and take him out by the south gate<br />
					and at the south of the city<br />
					cut off his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the princes' men were to do even as they were told.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Susīma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not that man in consequence<br />
					experience woe and sorrow?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether he experienced woe and sorrow or not,<br />
					would not the gaining admission<br />
					as a thief of doctrine<br />
					into a Norm and <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> Discipline so well set forth<br />
					have still more woeful<br />
					and still bitterer results,<br />
					yea, conduce to downfall hereafter?</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as thou, Susīma, hast seen thy transgression as transgression<br />
					and hast made confession as is right,<br />
					we do accept this from thee.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this, Susīma, it is to grow in the Ariyan discipline,<br />
					when having seen our transgression as transgression<br />
					we make confession as is right<br />
					and in future practise self-restraint."</p>
