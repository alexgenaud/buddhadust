					<p class="f4">The venerable Mahā-Kassapa and the venerable Sāriputta were once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#benares">Benares</a><br />
					at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#isipatana">Isipatana</a> at the Deerpark.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta had arisen at eventide from meditation<br />
					and he came to Mahā-Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">After exchanging greetings and talk of courtesy and friendliness<br />
					he sat down by Mahā-Kassapa and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is said, friend Kassapa,<br />
					that without ardour<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and without care<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a man is incapable of enlightenment,<br />
					incapable of Nibbāna,<br />
					incapable of reaching the uttermost safety,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but that with ardour and with care<br />
					he is capable of enlightenment,<br />
					capable of Nibbāna,<br />
					capable of reaching the uttermost safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now how far is this so<br />
					that without ardour<br />
					and without care<br />
					a man is incapable of enlightenment,<br />
					incapable of Nibbāna,<br />
					incapable of reaching the uttermost safety,<br />
					but that with ardour and with care<br />
					he is capable of enlightenment,<br />
					capable of Nibbāna,<br />
					capable of reaching the uttermost safety?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, friend, a brother thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have not arisen,<br />
					were they to arise,<br />
					would conduce to my hurt'<br />
					- and no ardour is aroused.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have arisen,<br />
					if they are not eliminated,<br />
					would conduce to my hurt,'<br />
					- and no ardour is aroused.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good states that have not arisen,<br />
					were they not to arise,<br />
					would conduce to my hurt,'<br />
					- and no ardour is aroused.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good states that have arisen,<br />
					were they to cease,<br />
					would conduce to my hurt,'<br />
					- and no ardour is aroused.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">This is to be without ardour.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friend, is a man without care?</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, friend, a brother thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have not arisen,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Bad and evil states that have arisen,<br />

					without <a id="pg133"><span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></a> care,<br />
					is incapable of enlightenment,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is to have ardour.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, friend, is he careful?</p>
