					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Maha-Koṭṭhita arose at eventide from meditation<br />

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />

					but grasping is conditioned by craving."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br />

					in a different person,<br />
					in one who is both same and different,<br />
					or in one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />

					<p class="f4">"What now, friend Sāriputta,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not any one of these, friend Koṭṭhita,<br />
					is consciousness,<br />
					but consciousness is conditioned by name-and-shape."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lo! now <a id="we">we</a> understand the venerable Sāriputta's words thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither name-and-shape,<br />
					nor consciousness<br />
					is any one of these four:<br />
					wrought in one and the same person,<br />
					wrought in a different person,<br />
					wrought by one who is both,<br />
					wrought by one who is neither the same nor a different person -<br />
					but arisen by chance;<br />
					moreover name-and-shape<br />
					is conditioned by consciousness,<br />
					consciousness is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, friend Sāriputta,<br />
					is the meaning of what you have said to be regarded?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, friend, I will make you a simile,<br />
					for through a simile<br />
					some intelligent men<br />
					admit the meaning of what has been said.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if, friend,<br />
					there stood two sheaves of reeds<br />
					leaning one against the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, friend, name-and-shape<br />
					comes to pass conditioned <a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></a> by consciousness,<br />
					consciousness conditioned by name-and-shape,<br />
					sense conditioned by name-and-shape,<br />
					contact is conditioned by sense,<br />
					feeling is conditioned by contact,<br />
					craving is conditioned by feeling,<br />
					grasping is conditioned by craving,<br />
					becoming is conditioned by grasping,<br />
					birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even such is the uprising<br />
					of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, friend, I were to pull towards me one of those sheaves of reeds,<br />
					the other would fall;<br />
					if I were to pull towards me the other,<br />
					the former would fall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, friend, from the ceasing of name-and-shape,<br />
					consciousness ceases;<br />
					from the ceasing of consciousness,<br />
					name-and-shape ceases;<br />
					from the ceasing of name-and-shape<br />
					sense ceases,<br />
					from the ceasing of sense,<br />
					contact ceases,<br />
					from the ceasing of contact,<br />
					craving ceases,<br />
					from the ceasing of craving,<br />
					feeling ceases,<br />
					from the ceasing of feeling,<br />
					grasping ceases,<br />
					from the ceasing of grasping,<br />
					becoming ceases,<br />
					from the ceasing of becoming,<br />
					birth ceases,<br />
					even such is the ceasing,<br />
					of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, friend Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">How well is this uttered by the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and for this that has been uttered by him<br />
					with these thirty-six bases we thank him."</p>
