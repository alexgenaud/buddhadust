					<p class="f4">"There are these four foods,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> brethren,<br />
					for the maintenance <a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> of beings<br />
					that have come to birth,<br />
					or for the forwarding of those<br />
					who seek to come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material food, coarse or fine;<br />
					contact is the second,<br />
					willing of mind is the third,<br />
					consciousness is the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four foods<br />
					for the maintenance of beings<br />
					that have come to birth,<br />
					or for the forwarding of those<br />
					who seek to come to be.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, brethren,<br />
					is material food to be considered?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if two parents<br />
					who had taken slender provisions<br />
					were on their way in the path through the jungle,<br />
					and theirs was an only child dear and sweet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now suppose that the scanty provisions<br />
					of those parents in the jungle<br />
					came to an end, used up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose that there was yet<br />
					a portion of the jungle untraversed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those parents might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What scanty provisions we had<br />
					are come to an end, are used up,<br />
					and there is this remainder of the jungle to traverse.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if we were to slay<br />
					this our only child, sweet and dear,<br />
					and make both dried pieces and juicy pieces,<br />
					and so eating flesh of child,<br />
					might traverse that remainder of the jungle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us not all three perish!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so those two parents<br />
					slew that only child sweet and dear,<br />
					and made both dried pieces and juicy pieces,<br />
					and so, eating flesh of child<br />
					they could traverse that remainder of the jungle.</p>

					<p class="f4">They would both eat child-flesh<br />
					and smite on their breasts crying;<br />
					'Where is our only child?<br />
					Where is our only child?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would they take the food for sport?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would they take the food from indulgence?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would they take the food for personal charm?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would they take the food for plumpness?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so; lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Would they not take the food, brethren,<br />
					in order that they might last<br />
					till the jungle was crossed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br />
					I declare should solid food be regarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">When such food is well understood,<br />
					the passions of the five senses are well understood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the passions of the five <a id="pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> senses are well understood,<br />
					the fetters do not exist<br />
					bound by which the Ariyan disciple<br />
					could come again to this world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, brethren,<br />
					is the food that is contact to be regarded?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, brethren,<br />
					a cow with a sore hide<br />
					should stand leaning against a wall,<br />
					the creatures that live on the wall would bite her;<br />
					if she stood leaning against a tree,<br />
					the creatures that live on the tree would bite her;<br />
					yea, whatever she stood leaning against,<br />
					whatever creatures lived thereon would bite her.</p>

					<p class="f4">If she stood buoyed up by water,<br />
					the creatures that live in the water would bite her;<br />
					if she stood buoyed up by the air,<br />
					the creatures that live in dependence on the air would bite her,<br />
					yea, whatever she stood up against,<br />
					whatsoever creatures that lived in dependence thereon would bite her.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so do I declare<br />
					that the food which is contact should be regarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">When such food is well understood,<br />
					the three feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> are well understood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the three feelings are well understood,<br />
					I declare that there is nothing further<br />
					which the Ariyan disciple has to do.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, brethren,<br />
					is the food that is will of mind to be regarded?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, brethren, there were a pit of charcoal,<br />
					deeper than a man is high,<br />
					filled with clear, glowing, smokeless charcoal.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a man were to come by,<br />
					loving his life,<br />
					not loving death,<br />
					loving happiness,<br />
					and loathing pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">And two strong men<br />
					seizing him by each arm<br />
					were to drag him up to the pit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now to be far from that, brethren,<br />
					would be the will of that man,<br />
					to be far would be his wish,<br />
					to be far would be his aspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily the man would think:<br />
					— 'I shall fall on that heap of charcoal;<br />
					through that I shall come in for death,<br />
					or for mortal pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, I declare<br />
					that the food which is will of mind should be regarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that food is well understood,<br />
					the three cravings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> are well understood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When these are well understood, I declare<br />
					that there is nothing further<br />
					that the Ariyan disciple has to do.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg70"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></a> And how, brethren,<br />
					is the food that is consciousness to be regarded?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, brethren,<br />
					they were to seize a robber, an evildoer,<br />
					and were to show him to the king, saying:<br />
					— 'This man, sire, is a robber, an evildoer.<br />
					Inflict on him such punishment as is desired.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the king should pronounce this concerning him:<br />
					— 'Go, masters, smite this man at dawn<br />
					with a hundred darts.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at noon the king should declare this:<br />
					— 'Ho, masters, how is that man?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this moment, sire, he is alive.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the king should pronounce this concerning him:<br />
					— 'Go, masters, smite this man at noon<br />
					with a hundred darts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at eventide the king should declare this:<br />
					— 'Ho, masters, how is that man?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this moment, sire, he is alive.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the king should pronounce this concerning him:<br />
					— 'Go, masters, smite this man at eventide<br />
					with a hundred darts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, brethren?<br />
					Would that man,<br />
					smitten during the day by three hundred darts,<br />
					suffer therefrom pain and sorrow?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were he smitten, lord,<br />
					by but one dart,<br />
					he would therefrom suffer pain and sorrow;<br />
					what need to speak of being smitten by three hundred?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren, do I declare<br />
					that the food called consciousness should be regarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness, brethren, is well understood,<br />
					name-and-shape is well understood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When name-and-shape is well understood, I declare<br />
					there is nothing further that the Ariyan disciple has to do."</p>
