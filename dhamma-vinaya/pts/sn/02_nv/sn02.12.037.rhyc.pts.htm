					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This body, brethren, is not your own,<br />
					neither is it that of any others.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It should be regarded<br />
					as brought about by action of the past,<br />
					by plans,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by volitions,<br />
					by feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> Now here, brethren, the well-taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					gives his mind thoroughly and systematically<br />
					to the causal law, to wit,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This being,<br />
					that comes to be;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />

					this not being,<br />

					<p class="f4">To wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape six-fold-sense,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br />

							<p>Mrs. Rhys Davids tries to explain 'not-self' while retaining self here and ends up in a mess. The 'process' works by '<i>this</i> resulting in <i>that</i>'. The idea of 'self' or 'soul' is based on speculative theories and needs to be let go to see the process without the distortion of 'self'-bias.</p>
