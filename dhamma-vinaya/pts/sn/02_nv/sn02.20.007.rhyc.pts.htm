					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi</a> at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Exalted One addressed the brethren: —</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p2">2</a>]</span> Once upon a time, brethren, the Dasārahas had a kettle­drum called Summoner.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p3">3</a>]</span> As it began to split the Dasārahas fixed in ever another peg, until the time came that the Summoner's original drumhead had vanished and only the framework of pegs remained.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p4">4</a>]</span>  <a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> Even so, brethren, will the brethren become in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p5">5</a>]</span> Those Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the void, to these when uttered, they will not listen, they will not lend a ready ear, they will not bring to them an understanding heart, they will not deem those doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, that which should be mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p6">6</a>]</span> But those Suttantas which are made by poets, which are poetry, which are a manifold of words, a manifold of phrases, alien, the utterances of disciples, to these when uttered they will listen, they will lend a ready ear, they will bring an understanding heart, they will deem these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, which should be mastered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, brethren, that the Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the void, will disappear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p7">7</a>]</span> Wherefore, brethren, ye are thus to train yourselves :-</p>

					<p class="f4">To these very Suttantas will we listen, will we give a ready ear, to these will we bring an understanding heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we will deem these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, and mastered:<br />
					- even thus.</p>
