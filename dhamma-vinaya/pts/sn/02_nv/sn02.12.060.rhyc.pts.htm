<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 6. Rukkha Vagga), Sutta 60. After Ānanda praises the exposition of the paṭicca samuppāda to him, The Buddha cautions him that this is no easy thing to see and he goes on to liken the prospects for continued growth for one who delights in contimplation of whatever is included under the heading of fuel to the condition of a great tree with healthy roots sucking up it's nourishment." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kuru">Kurus</a> at Kammāsadamma,<br />
					a township of the Kurus.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, lord, marvellous, lord,<br />
					is the depth of this causal law<br />
					and how deep it appears.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And yet I reckon it as ever so plain."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Ānanda,<br />
					say not so!</p>

					<p class="f4">Deep indeed is this causal law,<br />
					and deep indeed it appears.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through not knowing,<br />
					not understanding,<br />
					not penetrating,<br />
					that doctrine,<br />
					that this generation has become entangled<br />
					like a ball of string,<br />
					and covered with blight,<br />
					like unto munja grass and rushes,<br />
					unable to overpass the doom of the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					the Constant Faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, Ānanda, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br />
					in all <a id="pg65"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></a> that makes for grasping,<br />
					there comes a descent of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Name-and-shape is conditioned by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contact is conditioned by sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling is conditioned by contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is condtitioned by feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br />
					the roots whereof<br />
					going downward and across<br />
					bring upward all the juice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda, such a great tree<br />
					so fed,<br />
					so supplied with fuel<br />
					would stand for a long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br />
					in all that makes for grasping,<br />
					there comes a descent of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Name-and-shape is conditioned by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sense is conditioned by name-and-shape.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, Ānanda, who contemplates the misery that there is<br />
					in all that makes for grasping,<br />
					there comes no descent of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness ceases, name-and-shape ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When sense ceases, contact ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When contact ceases, feeling ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a great tree,<br />
					and a man were to come with axe and basket,<br />
					and were to cut down that tree at the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cutting it by the root<br />
					he were to dig a trench<br />
					and were to pull out the roots<br />
					even to the rootlets<br />
					and root-fibres.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he were to cut the tree into logs,<br />
					and were then to split the logs,<br />
					and were then to make the logs into chips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he were to dry the chips in wind and sun,<br />
					then burn them by fire,<br />
					then make an ashheap,<br />
					then winnow the ashes in a strong wind,<br />
					or let them be borne down<br />
					by the swift stream of a river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily that great tree<br />
					thus cut down at the root<br />
					would be made as a palmtree stump,<br />
					a no-thing,<br />
					incapable of growing again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br />
					in all that makes for grasping,<br />
					there comes no descent of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness ceases, name-and-shape ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When name-and-shape ceases, sense ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When sense ceases, contact ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When contact ceases, feeling ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When feeling ceases, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					suffering,<br />
