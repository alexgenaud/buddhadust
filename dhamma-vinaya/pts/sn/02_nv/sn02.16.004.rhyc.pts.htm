					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What think ye as to this, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">What manner of brother is worthy,<br />
					and what manner of brother is unworthy<br />
					to go among the families?</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br />
					if the meaning of this that he has spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will bear it in mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brethren, listen,<br />
					give your mind thoroughly,<br />
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br />
					they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, brethren, if a brother go among the families with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let them only give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly, not scantily!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them give me excellent things only, not poor things!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give quickly, not tardily!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully, not disrespectfully!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br />
					if they give not, is vexed,<br />
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br />
					if they give scantily, is vexed,<br />
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br />
					if they give poor things, is vexed,<br />
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br />
					if they give tardily, is vexed,<br />
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, going among the families with such thoughts,<br />
					if they give disrespectfully, is vexed,<br />
					and he feels pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">This manner of brother<br />
					is unworthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But that brother who goes among the families<br />
					with such a mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How could I possibly think<br />
					on this occasion<br />
					with regard to others,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let them only give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br />
					not scantily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me excellent things,<br />
					not poor things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me quickly,<br />
					not tardily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br />
					not disrespectfully!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give not,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, if they give scantily,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give poor things,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give tardily,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give disrespectfully,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a manner of brother<br />
					is worthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Kassapa, brethren, is of such a mind<br />
					as he goes among the families:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How could I possibly think<br />
					on this occasion<br />
					with regard to others:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let them only give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them not refuse to give!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me abundantly,<br />
					not scantily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me excellent things,<br />
					not poor things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me quickly,<br />
					not tardily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them only give to me respectfully,<br />
					not disrespectfully!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give not,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, if they give scantily,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give poor things,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give tardily,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, when they give disrespectfully,<br />
					is not vexed,<br />
					nor does he feel pain and sorrow because of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a manner of brother<br />
					is worthy to go among the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, brethren, by <a id="pg136"><span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span></a> Kassapa will I exhort you,<br />
					or by one like Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">By them exhorted<br />
					ye are to practise<br />
					that ye may so attain.</p>
