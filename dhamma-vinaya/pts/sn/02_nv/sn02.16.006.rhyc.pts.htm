					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and sat down at his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br />
					the Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Exhort the brethren, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give them discourse on doctrine, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I, Kassapa, or thou<br />
					must exhort the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I or thou<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					must give them discourse on doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br />
					it is difficult to speak to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are in a state<br />
					that makes it difficult to speak to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are intractable,<br />
					they pay no deference to instruction.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For instance, lord,<br />
					I saw Bhaṇḍa,<br />
					the brother who is the colleague of Ānanda,<br />
					and Abhiñjika,<br />
					who is the colleague of Anuruddha<br />
					out-talking each other thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed a brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">tell my word to Bhaṇḍa,<br />
					the brother who dwelleth with Ānanda<br />
					and Abhiñjika,<br />
					the brother who dwelleth with Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Master would speak to you."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> "Even so, lord,"<br />
					responded that brother,<br />
					and he went into the presence of Bhaṇḍa,<br />
					the brother who dwelleth with Ānanda<br />
					and Abhiñjika,<br />
					the brother who dwelleth with Anuruddha and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Master, friends, would speak to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend", they responded<br />
					and they went into the presence of the Exalted one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having come into the prsence of the Exalted one<br />
					they saluted him,<br />
					and sat down down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To them thus seated<br />
					the Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true what they say, brethren,<br />
					that ye have been out-talking each other thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do ye affirm, brethren,<br />
					that I have been teaching you<br />
					to out-talk each other in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If as ye say, brethren,<br />
					ye do not affirm that I have been teaching you thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer?',</p>

					<p class="f4">whatever then,<br />
					futile men that ye are,<br />
					have ye come to know,<br />
					have ye come to see,<br />
					in a Doctrine and a Discipline so well declared,<br />
					wherein ye are in orders,<br />
					that ye should be out-talking each other<br />
					as to what ye have learnt,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer?'".</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brethren,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					falling prone at the feet of the Exalted One,<br />
					spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Transgression hath overcome us, lord,<br />
					so foolish,<br />
					so stupid,<br />
					so wrong were we,<br />
					in that we,<br />
					who are in orders<br />
					under a Doctrine and Discipline so well declared,<br />
					did out-talk one another therein, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer.'</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept<br />
					this our confession, lord,<br />
					for restraint in the future."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, brethren, hath transgression overcome you,<br />
					so foolish,<br />
					so stupid,<br />
					so wrong were ye<br />
					in that ye, who are in orders<br />
					under a Doctrine and Discipline so well declared,<br />
					did out-talk each other, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brother,<br />
					which will speak the more?<br />
					which will speak the better?<br />
					which will speak the longer.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as ye, brethren,<br />
					have seen your transgression as transgression,<br />
					and have made confession,<br />
					as is right,<br />
					we do accept this from you.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this, brethren, it is to grow in the Ariyan Discipline,<br />
					when having <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> seen transgression as transgression<br />
					we make confession as is right,<br />
					and in future practise self-restraint."</p>
