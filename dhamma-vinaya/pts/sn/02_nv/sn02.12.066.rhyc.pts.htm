					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kuru">Kurus</a>,<br />
					at Kammasadamma,<br />
					a township of the Kurus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do ye handle, brethren, with an inward handling?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> When he had said this,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, Lord, handled with an inward handling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now how, brother, do you handle<br />
					with an inward handling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that brother answered,<br />
					but thereby did not win over the heart of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus said,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time, Exalted One,<br />
					now is the time, Blessed One,<br />
					for the Exalted One to speak of the inward handling,<br />
					when they have heard the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br />
					do ye listen,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br />
					responded those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this religion, brethren,<br />
					a brother handling<br />
					handles the inward handling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This various, manifold suffering<br />
					that arises in the world<br />

					<p class="f4">What being does decay-and-death come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">What not being does decay-and-death not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He handling knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This various, manifold suffering<br />
					that arises in the world<br />
					which is decay-and-death: -<br />
					this suffering has substance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> as its basis,<br />

					<p class="f4">Where there is substance,<br />
					there decay-and-death comes to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where substance is not,<br />
					decay-and-death comes not to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows decay-and-death,<br />
					its uprising<br />
					and its ceasing,<br />
					and he knows the way that is meet<br />
					for going to the ceasing of decay-and-death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus practising he becomes one<br />
					who walks according to the doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him, brethren, we call a brother who practises <a id="pg77"><span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></a> rightly<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, handling<br />
					he handles the inward handling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This substance<br />

					what is its uprising,<br />
					what is its source,<br />
					what is its cause?</p>

					<p class="f4">What being does substance come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">What not being does it not come to be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He rightly handling knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus practising<br />

					where when it arises<br />
					does it arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where when it settles<br />
					does it settle?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He in handling comes to know this: -</p>
