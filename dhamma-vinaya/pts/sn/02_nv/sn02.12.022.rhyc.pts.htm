<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Dasabala Vagga), Sutta 22. The Buddha states that it is because he has ten powers and is confident in four ways that he is able to teach about the components of existence, their arising and their ending and then adds an inspiring admonition to give up lazy ways and take on energy to accomplish the goal." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata, brethren,<br />
					endowed with the ten powers,<br />
					and the four confidences,<br />
					claims the Place of the Bull;<br />
					he roars the Lion's Roar amid the congregations;<br />
					he turns the Divine Wheel,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is material shape,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is feeling,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is perception,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such are activities,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away;</p>

					<p class="f4">such is consciousness,<br />
					such is its arising,<br />
					such is its passing away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This' being,<br />
					'that' becomes;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises;<br />
					this not being,<br />
					that becomes not;<br />
					from the ceasing of this,<br />
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say,<br />
					Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br />
					conditioned by sense contact,<br />
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br />
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br />
					conditioned by craving <a id="pg24"><span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></a> grasping,<br />
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br />
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br />
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br />
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br />
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br />
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br />
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br />
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br />
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br />
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br />
					from ceasing of birth,<br />
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, brethren, the Norm being well declared by me,<br />
					made manifest,<br />
					disclosed,<br />
					brought to light,<br />
					stripped of its swathings,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it is enough for the clansman<br />
					who has left the world through faith<br />
					to stir up energy<br />
					and vow:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Verily let skin and sinews and bones wilt in my body,<br />
					let flesh and blood dry up,<br />
					yet shall there be upkeep of energy<br />
					till I have won<br />
					that which by man's strength,<br />
					by man's energy,<br />
					by man's progress<br />
					may be won!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sadly, brethren,<br />
					lives the man of sloth,<br />
					involved in bad,<br />
					wicked things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great is the salvation<br />
					which he fails to win.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he of stirred up energy<br />
					lives happily,<br />
					aloof from bad,<br />
					wicked things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great is the salvation<br />
					that he makes perfect.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not by that which is low, brethren,<br />
					may the highest be won;<br />
					by that which is highest<br />
					may the highest be won.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of praise, brethren,<br />
					is this divine life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher has come to you<br />
					face to face.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore stir up energy<br />
					that ye may win<br />
					what is not won,<br />
					that ye may attain<br />
					what is not attained,<br />
					that ye may realize<br />
					what is unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus will this<br />
					our leaving the world<br />
					not be barren,<br />
					but a fruitful<br />
					and a growing thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily the necessaries that we enjoy:<br />
					the equipment of robes,<br />
					alms,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medicine,<br />
					though they be humble,<br />
					shall be to us<br />
					of great profit<br />
					and advantage.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For thus, brethren,<br />
					must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man discern his own good,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					this is enough to call up earnestness;<br />
					if <a id="pg25"><span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span></a> he discern another's good,<br />
					this is enough to call up earnestness;<br />
					if he discern both his own and another's good,<br />
					this is enough to call up earnestness.</p>
