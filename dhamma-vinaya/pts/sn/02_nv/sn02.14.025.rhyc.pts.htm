					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Unbelievers flow together, meet together with unbelievers,<br />
					they who take life with they who take life,<br />
					they who take what is not given with they who take what is not given,<br />
					they who wrongly act in desires of sense with they who wrongly act in desires of sense,<br />
					the liars with the liars<br />
					those given to strong drink with those given to strong drink.</p>
