<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 6. Rukkha Vagga), Sutta 61. The Buddha points out that because it is easier to become repelled by body than by mind, that it would be better for most people if they thought of the body as the self that way they would not be attached to it and might more easily become free from it. Then he compairs the mind to a monkey traveling from branch to branch." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The untaught manyfolk, brethren,<br />
					might well be repelled by this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					might cease to fancy it<br />
					and wish to be free from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Seen is the growth and decay of this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					the taking on<br />
					and the laying down of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence well might the manyfolk be repelled by it,<br />
					cease to fancy it,<br />
					and wish to be free from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet this, brethren, that we call thought,<br />
					that we call mind,<br />
					that we call consciousness,<br />
					by this the untaught manyfolk<br />
					are not able to feel repelled,<br />
					they are not able to cease fancying it<br />
					or to be freed from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day, brethren,<br />
					has it been for the uneducated manyfolk<br />
					that to which they cleave,<br />
					that which they call 'mine,'<br />
					that which they wrongly conceive thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is mine;<br />
					this I am;<br />
					this is my spirit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence the untaught manyfolk<br />
					are not able to feel repelled by it,<br />
					are not able to cease fancying it,<br />
					are not able to be freed from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were better, brethren,<br />
					if the untaught manyfolk approached this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					as the self rather than the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Seen is it, brethren, how this body,<br />
					child of the four great elements,<br />
					persists for a year,<br />
					<a id="pg66"><span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span></a> persists for two years,<br />
					persists for three,<br />
					four,<br />
					five,<br />
					ten,<br />
					twenty,<br />
					thirty years,<br />
					persists for forty,<br />
					for fifty years,<br />
					persists for a hundred years<br />
					and even longer.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this, brethren, that we call thought,<br />
					that we call mind,<br />
					that we call consciousness,<br />
					that arises as one thing,<br />
					ceases as another,<br />
					whether by night or by day.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a monkey, brethren,<br />
					faring through the woods,<br />
					through the great forest<br />
					catches hold of a bough,<br />
					letting it go<br />
					seizes another,<br />
					even so that which we call thought,<br />
					that we call mind,<br />
					that we call consciousness,<br />
					that arises as one thing,<br />
					ceases as another,<br />
					both by night and by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren, the well taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					gives his mind thoroughly and systematically<br />
					to the causal law:</p>

					<p class="f4">This being,<br />
					that comes to be;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">This not being,<br />
					that does not come to be;<br />
					from the cessation of this,<br />
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br />
					conditioned by sense contact,<br />
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br />
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br />
					conditioned by craving grasping,<br />
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br />
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br />
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance ceasing of activities;<br />
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br />
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br />
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br />
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br />
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br />
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br />
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br />
					from ceasing of birth,<br />
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing thus, brethren,<br />
					the well taught Ariyan disciple<br />
					is repelled by bodily shape,<br />
					is repelled by feeling<br />
					and by perception<br />
					and by activities<br />
					and by consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being repelled<br />
					he is not attracted by them;<br />
					unattracted he is set free,<br />
					and the knowledge comes<br />
					in freedom<br />
					about freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows that birth is perished,<br />
					the divine life lived,<br />
					done that which was to be done,<br />
					no hereafter to these conditions!</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
