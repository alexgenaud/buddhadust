<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Dasabala Vagga), Sutta 24. Sāriputta teaches Wanderers that ask about who causes kammic consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in kammic consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Ānanda remarking on how interesting it is that the whole doctrine could be stated with one word like this, when asked to do so, gives a version of the sequence in detail." />
