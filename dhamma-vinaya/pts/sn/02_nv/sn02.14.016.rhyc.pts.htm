					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Through an element it is, brethren,<br />
					that beings flow together,<br />
					meet together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br />
					flow together,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the future, brethren, through an element it will be,<br />

					meet together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br />

					<p class="f4">Beings of low tastes<br />
					flow together,<br />
					meet together<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, brethren, as muck flows together,<br />
					meets together with muck,<br />
					urine with urine,<br />
					pus with pus,<br />

					through an element it is, brethren,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">Lust's jungle, of association born,<br />
							By not associating is cut down.<br />
							As one who, mounted on a puny plank,<br />
							Is in mid-ocean whelmed beneath the waves,<br />
							So even he of blameless life doth sink<br />
							When thrown together with the man of sloth.<br />
							Wherefore from such let him keep well apart -<br />
							The sluggard and the poor in energy.<br />
							Let him consort with those who live aloof,<br />
							With noble, eager, contemplative souls,<br />
							With men of constant quickened energies,<br />
							Yea, let him hold communion with the wise.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
