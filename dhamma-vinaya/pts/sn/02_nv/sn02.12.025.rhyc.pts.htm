<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Dasabala Vagga), Sutta 25. Sāriputta teaches Venerable Bumija who asks about who causes kammic consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in kammic consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Gotama goes on to explain that pleasure and pain corespond to the intent with which deeds of body, speech and mind are done. He further explains that intent can originate with the self or with another and can be done by the self either knowingly or without reflection." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> The Pali text in some versions ends this section with <i>'avijjāpaccayā va'</i> and in some versions has this phrase as beginning the next section. Woodward, in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p171"><i>AN</i> 4.171</a> has opted to use it both at the end of this section and the beginning of the next. Mrs. Rhys Davids has put it at the beginning of the next section per the PTS text. Put at the beginning of the second section, it should also be at the beginning of the next two sections which is how I have reconstructed it here. Bhk. Thanissaro abridges, but appears to indicate that he would follow this plan. Bhk. Bodhi has it only at the end of the first section. It makes bad sense in this position. The idea described there is that it is intent (Bhk. Bodhi's 'volition') that is the basis for the arising of pleasant or painful consequences of deeds. Intent can be ignorant or not, ignorance is not an alternative to intent. The BJT Pali is a complete mess.</p>
