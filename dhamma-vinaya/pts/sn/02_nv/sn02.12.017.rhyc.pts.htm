<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Ahara Vagga), Sutta 17. Kassapa, a naked ascetic, asks the Buddha a series of questions about the source of pain and to each of his questions receives the response, 'it is not such as that.' When Kassapa asks for an explanation, The Buddha teaches him the 'Doctrine of the Middle': that is, the Paticca Samuppada, the chain of interdependent factors giving rise to the experience of individualized existence and the resulting pain." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One in the early morning dressed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					entered Rājagaha, for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Kassapa the Unclothed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> saw the Exalted One coming from afar,<br />
					and seeing him<br />
					he came up to the Exalted One and greeted him,<br />
					and when compliments of friendship and courtesy had been exchanged<br />
					he stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would fain ask Master <a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> Gotama concerning one point,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					if he would give us opportunity<br />
					of hearing him reply to our question."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is untimely just now for questions, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have entered the village."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But a second time Kassapa Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would fain ask Master Gotama concerning one point,<br />
					if he would give us opportunity<br />
					of hearing him reply to our question."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time The Exalted One responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is untimely just now for questions, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have entered the village."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Kassapa Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would fain ask Master Gotama concerning one point,<br />
					if he would give us opportunity<br />
					of hearing him reply to our question."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time The Exalted One responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is untimely just now for questions, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have entered the village."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Exalted One had thus spoken,<br />
					Kassapa the Unclothed said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not many things<br />
					we are fain to ask of Master Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ask, Kassapa, what you will."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now then, Master Gotama,<br />
					is suffering wrought by one's self?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br />
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					is one's suffering wrought by another?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br />
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					is suffering wrought both by one's self<br />
					and by another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br />
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					has [the] suffering [which is] wrought neither by myself<br />
					nor by another,<br />
					befallen me by chance?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so verily, Kassapa,"<br />
					said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					is suffering non-existent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, Kassapa, suffering is not non-existent;<br />
					suffering is."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Master Gotama<br />
					neither knows nor sees suffering?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, Kassapa, I am not one who knows not suffering<br />
					nor sees it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one that knows suffering, Kassapa,<br />
					I am one that sees suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How now, Master Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br />
					'is suffering wrought by one's self?'<br />
					you have answered:<br />
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br />
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					is one's suffering wrought by another?'<br />
					you have answered:<br />
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br />
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br />

					and by another?'<br />
					you have answered:<br />
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br />
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					has [the] suffering [which is] wrought neither by myself<br />
					nor by another,<br />
					befallen me by chance?'<br />
					you have answered:<br />
					'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br />
					'What then, Master Gotama,<br />
					is suffering non-existent?'<br />
					you have answered:<br />
					<a id="pg16"><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></a> 'Not so verily, Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked:<br />
					'Then Master Gotama<br />
					neither knows nor sees suffering?'<br />
					you have answered:<br />
					'Nay, Kassapa, I am not one who knows not suffering<br />
					nor sees it.<br />
					I am one that knows suffering, Kassapa,<br />
					I am one that sees suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Declare then to me, Master, Exalted One,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					[the nature of] suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Teach me, Master, Exalted One,<br />
					the nature of suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'One and the same person<br />
					both acts and experiences [the results]'</p>

					<p class="f4">-this, Kassapa, which you called at first</p>

					<p class="f4">'suffering self-wrought,'</p>

					<p class="f4">amounts to the Eternalist theory.</p>

					<p class="f4">'One acts,<br />
					another experiences [the result]'</p>

					<p class="f4">this, Kassapa, which<br />
					to one smitten by the feeling<br />
					occurs as</p>

					<p class="f4">'suffering caused by another,'</p>

					<p class="f4">amounts to the Annihilationist theory.</p>

					<p class="f4">To you, Kassapa, the Tathāgata,<br />
					not approaching either extreme,<br />
					teaches the Norm by a middle [way]:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass,<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness;<br />
					conditioned by consciousness, name-and-shape;<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape, sense;<br />
					conditioned by sense, contact;<br />
					conditioned by contact, feeling;<br />
					conditioned by feeling, craving;<br />
					conditioned by craving, grasping;<br />
					conditioned by grasping, becoming;<br />
					conditioned by becoming,<br />
					birth,<br />
					decay-and-death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br />
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br />
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br />
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br />
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br />
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br />
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br />
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br />
					from ceasing of birth,<br />
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said Kassapa the Unclothed said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which had been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which was hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who had gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br />
					so that those who had eyes could see shapes, -<br />
					even so, lord, has the lord Gotama shown me<br />
					his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord, betake myself to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world<br />
					under the Rule of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would be ordained."</p>

					<p class="f4">"He, Kassapa, who, being formerly a votary of another doctrine,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					desires to leave the world<br />
					to obtain orders in this Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					remains on probation for four months.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the end of four months<br />
					spent in seclusion,<br />
					the brethren,<br />
					moved in heart and willing,<br />
					receive him from the world<br />
					and <a id="pg17"><span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span></a> ordain him to be a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless, I acknowledge a difference in persons."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, lord, he who, formerly a votary of another doctrine,<br />
					desires to leave the world,<br />
					to obtain orders in this Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					goes on probation for four months,<br />
					and if at the end of four months<br />
					spent in seclusion,<br />
					the brethren,<br />
					moved in heart and willing,<br />
					receive him from the world<br />
					and ordain him to be a brother,<br />
					I will live on probation for four years.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the end of four years<br />
					so living<br />
					may the brethren,<br />
					moved in heart and will,<br />
					receive me<br />
					and ordain me as a brother."</p>

					<p class="f4">So Kassapa the Unclothed was received<br />
					under the Exalted One<br />
					and obtained ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br />
					the venerable Kassapa,<br />
					remaining alone and separate,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and strenuous,<br />
					attained ere long<br />
					to that supreme goal of the divine life,<br />
					for the sake of which the clansmen<br />
					rightly go forth from home into the homeless:<br />
					yea, that supreme goal did he,<br />
					by himself,<br />
					even in this present life,<br />
					come to understand and realize,<br />
					namely, that birth was destroyed,<br />
					that the divine life was lived,<br />
					that the task was done,<br />
					that for life in these conditions<br />
					there was no hereafter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And that venerable Kassapa became one of the Arahants.</p>
