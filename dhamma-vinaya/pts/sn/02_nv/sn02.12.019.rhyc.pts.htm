					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a><br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the fool, brethren,<br />
					cloaked by ignorance<br />
					and tied to craving,<br />
					this body is wrought on this wise:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is just this body<br />
					and names-and-shapes without:<br />
					thus this pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the pair [there is] contact,<br />
					just six spheres of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by these,<br />
					or by one of them,<br />
					the fool experiences pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">For the wise man, brethren,<br />
					cloaked by ignorance<br />
					and tied to craving<br />
					this body is wrought on this wise:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is just this body<br />
					and names-and-shapes without:<br />
					thus this pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the pair [there is] contact,<br />
					just six spheres of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by these,<br />
					or by one of them,<br />
					the wise man experiences pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What, brethren, is there here that is different,<br />
					distinctive,<br />
					diverse<br />
					between the wise man and the fool?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, things have the Exalted One as their root,<br />
					their guide,<br />
					their resort.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed were it<br />
					if the meaning <a id="pg20"><span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></a> of this that he has spoken<br />
					were to manifest itself in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it from him<br />
					the brethren will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brethren,<br />
					listen,<br />
					give your mind thoroughly<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br />
					responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ignorance, brethren,<br />
					wherewith the fool,<br />
					whose body is so wrought,<br />
					is cloaked,<br />
					the craving whereto he is tied,<br />
					that ignorance the fool has not thrown off,<br />
					that craving is not withered away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fool has not lived the divine life<br />
					for the right withering away of ill,<br />
					therefore the fool<br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					is on his way to [another]<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He being on his way thither<br />
					is not set free from birth,<br />
					nor from old age<br />
					and death,<br />
					nor from grievings,<br />
					from lamentings,<br />
					from ills,<br />
					from sorrows,<br />
					from despairs -</p>

					<p class="f4">I say, he is not set free from Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The ignorance, brethren,<br />
					wherewith the wise man,<br />
					whose body is so wrought,<br />
					is cloaked,<br />
					the craving whereto he is tied,<br />
					that ignorance the wise man has thrown off,<br />
					and that craving is withered away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The wise man has lived the divine life<br />
					for the right withering away of ill,<br />
					therefore the wise man<br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					is not on his way to [another sense-] body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He not being on his way thither<br />
					is set free from rebirth,<br />
					from old age<br />
					and death,<br />
					from grievings,<br />
					from lamentings,<br />
					from ills,<br />
					from sorrows,<br />
					from despairs -</p>

					<p class="f4">I say, he is set free from Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, is how the wise man is different,<br />
					distinctive,<br />
					diverse from the fool,<br />
					namely in that he lives the divine life."</p>
