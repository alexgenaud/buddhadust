<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 5. Gahapati Vagga), Sutta 42. The Buddha tells a group of bhikkhus that when a disciple is able to identify in himself that he is free from the five sources of guilty dread in poor ethical behavior, when he has solid faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saṇgha, and when he has wised up to the aristocratic method, he may call himself a Streamwinner and assure himself that rebirth below human states is finished." />

					<p class="f4">Which 'four possessions of the Streamwinner' are his?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> In this religion, brethren, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					possesses unwavering faith in the Buddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He it is, the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant supremely enlightened,<br />
					proficient in wisdom and righteousness,<br />
					Wellfarer,<br />
					Worldknower,<br />
					peerless Driver of men to be tamed,<br />

					upright is their practice,<br />
					practised are they in the Law,<br />
					practised in right lines of action,<br />

					<p class="f4">And which is the Ariyan truth that he has well seen by insight,<br />
					well penetrated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, brethren, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					thoroughly and systematically<br />
					gives his mind to the Causal Law,<br />
					thus: -</p>

					<p class="f4">This being,<br />

					this not being,<br />
					that does not come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the arising of this,<br />
					that arises;<br />
					from the ceasing of this,<br />
					that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br />
					conditioned by sense contact,<br />
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br />
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br />
					conditioned by craving grasping,<br />
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br />
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br />
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br />
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br />
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br />

					<p class="f4">And when, brethren, for the Ariyan disciple<br />
					this fivefold guilty dread is mastered,<br />

					and when he has by insight well seen and penetrated this Ariyan truth,<br />
					he, if he desire it,<br />
					may declare himself by himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am he for whom perished is purgatory,<br />
