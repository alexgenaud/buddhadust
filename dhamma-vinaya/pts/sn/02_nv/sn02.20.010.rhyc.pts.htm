					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.20.010.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi</a> at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a certain brother<br />
					spent too much time among the clansmen's houses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the brethren admonished him<br />
					not to spend too much time<br />
					over such intercourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">That brother being spoken to by them<br />
					did not desist.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then many of them went and told the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, brethren,<br />
					a cat was standing<br />
					on the refuse-heap of a house-sewer,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					watching for a mouse,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When this mouse will come out of her home,<br />
					I shall then <a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> and there catch and eat her.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And that mouse did come out of her home,<br />
					and the cat pounced violently on her,<br />
					disposed of her,<br />
					swallowed her.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the mouse gnawed his guts,<br />
					gnawed his bowels,<br />
					thence he came to death<br />
					or to mortal pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, with us<br />
					when a brother rising betimes<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					enters the village or township for alms,<br />
					unguarded in deed,<br />
					word<br />
					and thought,<br />
					without calling up self-possession,<br />
					without self-restraint,<br />
					it happens that there he sees womenfolk<br />
					thinly clad<br />
					or slightly clad.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seeing them<br />
					lust begins to assail his heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereby he comes to death<br />
					or to mortal pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this, brethren,<br />
					is death in the discipline of the Ariyan ­<br />
					that a man reject the training<br />
					and turn away to the low things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren,<br />
					is mortal pain -<br />
					that he incur some dire offence,<br />
					an offence, that is,<br />
					whence recovery is declared possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br />
					thus must ye train yourselves:­</p>

					<p class="f4">'Only with guarded deed,<br />
					word<br />
					and thought,<br />
					calling up self-possession,<br />
					and self-restraint<br />
					will we enter village or township for alms'<br />
					—even thus."</p>
