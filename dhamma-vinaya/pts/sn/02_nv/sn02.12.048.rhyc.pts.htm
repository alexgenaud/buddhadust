					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a><br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There a world-wise brahmin came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and exchanged greetings with him,<br />
					and in courteous and friendly converse<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What [say you] here, Master Gotama: -<br />
					everything is?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Everything is' -<br />
					that, brahmin, is the chief world-wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Master Gotama: -<br />
					nothing is?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Nothing is': -<br />
					that, brahmin, is the second world-wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Master Gotama,<br />
					everything is a unity?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Everything is a unity': -<br />
					that, brahmin, is the third world-wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Master Gotama: -<br />
					everything is a plurality?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Everything is a plurality': -<br />
					that, brahmin, is the fourth world-wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, not approaching either of these extremes,<br />
					teaches you a Doctrine by a middle [way]:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape sense,<br />
					conditioned by sense contact,<br />
					conditioned by contact feeling,<br />
					conditioned by feeling craving,<br />
					conditioned by craving grasping,<br />
					conditioned by grasping becoming,<br />
					conditioned by becoming birth,<br />
					conditioned by birth old age-and death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and ceasing of ignorance [comes] ceasing of activities;<br />
					from ceasing of activities ceasing of consciousness;<br />
					from ceasing of consciousness ceasing of name-and-shape;<br />
					from ceasing of name-and-shape ceasing of sense;<br />
					from ceasing of sense ceasing of contact;<br />
					from ceasing of contact ceasing of feeling;<br />
					from ceasing of feeling ceasing of craving;<br />
					from ceasing of craving ceasing of grasping;<br />
					from ceasing of grasping ceasing of becoming;<br />
					from ceasing of becoming ceasing of birth;<br />
					from ceasing of birth,<br />
					old age-and-death, grief, lamenting, suffering, sorrow, despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, the world-wise brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, Master Gotama, wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which had been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which was hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who had gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br />
					so that those who had eyes could see shapes, -<br />
					even so, lord, has the lord Gotama shown me<br />
					his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, even I, lord, betake myself to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama accept me as a follower,<br />
					as one who from this day forth,<br />
					as long as life lasts,<br />
					has taken his refuge therein!"</p>
