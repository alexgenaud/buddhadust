					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before my enlightenment, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">And knowledge, insight arose in me<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the last birth!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In his comments B. reads into these four the more abstract meanings - extension, cohesion, calorific property, mobility - that they came to have in later Abhidhamma. He refers throughout to their presence in the human body. The three characteristics here discerned in the four elements are also discerned in the senses, <i>S.</i> iv, 7-13; v, 194, 203 <i>f.;</i> in the bodily and mental factors in general, <i>ib.</i> iii, 81, 160 etc.; in feeling in particular, <i>ib.</i> iv, 208, 234; in sense-desires, <i>M.</i> i, 85, 92. Suttas 31, 32 occur in <i>A.</i> i, 258 <i>f.</i> and 33 in <i>A.</i> i, 260, where 'the elements' are replaced by 'the world.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Deities and devas are in the text both <i>deva: - sa-devake, sa-deva-manussāya.</i> We have no word that does not mislead, for to the Buddhist devas were not gods in the Vedic or the Greek or Christian sense, nor were they 'spirits,' since they were not 'discarnate.'</p>
