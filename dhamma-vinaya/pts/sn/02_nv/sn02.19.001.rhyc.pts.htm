Lakkhana asks the venerable Maha-Moggallāna to explain the reason that he smiled on their way to Rājagaha. Maha-Moggallāna tells of having seen a ghost suffering great torments. The Buddha says that he too has seen this ghost and reveals the reason it is experiencing such a fate. One in a series that comprise this chapter which should all be read together.">

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/lakkhana.htm">Lakkhana</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Mahā-Moggallāna</a><br />
					were staying at Vulture's Peak hill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					rising at an early hour<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					went to see the venerable Lakkhana<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, friend Lakkhana,<br />
					and enter Rājagaha for alms."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Lakkhana consented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					as he was descending the hill<br />
					and passing a certain place<br />
					smiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Lakkhana said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause, friend Moggallāna,<br />
					that you smile?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not the right time for that question, friend Lakkhana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me the question in the Exalted One's presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the twain had made their alms-round in Rājagaha,<br />
					had dined<br />
					and come away from their meal,<br />
					they went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and took their seat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Lakkhana said to Mahā-Moggallāna:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"As the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna was descending Vulture's Peak hill just now,<br />
					<a id="pg170"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></a> as he came to a certain place<br />
					he smiled:-</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the reason,<br />
					what was the cause for the smile?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, friend,<br />
					as I was descending Vulture's Peak hill,<br />
					I saw a skeleton<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> going through the air,<br />
					and vultures,<br />
					crows<br />
					and falcons<br />
					kept flying after it,<br />
					pecking at<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> its ribs,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					pulling it apart<br />
					while it<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> uttered cries of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, friend, came this thought:-</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 but this is wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 but this is marvellous<br />
					that a person will come to have such a shape,<br />
					that the individuality acquired<br />
					will come to have such a shape!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Disciples, brethren, live the life of vision,<br />
					yea, of insight,<br />
					since a disciple will know,<br />
					or will see,<br />
					or will testify<br />
					to a thing like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">I also, brethren, had seen that being before now,<br />
					yet I did not reveal it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I might have revealed it,<br />
					and others would not have believed me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had they not believed me,<br />
					it would have been to their hurt and their sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">This being, brethren,<br />
					was a cattle-butcher<br />
					in this very Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He by the effect of that work<br />
					has been punished<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> for many years,<br />
					for many hundreds,<br />
					nay, hundred thousands of years<br />
					in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now by the remaining effect of that work<br />
					he has acquired a personality of that kind."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This was a thera, one of the 1,000 Jaṭilas ordained by the Buddha when the three famous Kassapas were converted by him (<i>Vin. Texts</i> i, 132-5), and he had preached the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p28">'Burning'</a> Sermon; a very worthy saint. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The comment on the vision may thus be summarized:- The skeleton was a Peta. He and the birds, not being earth-dwellers, could only be seen clairvoyantly. They would not come into the focus of the earthly eye <i>(pasāda-cakkhu)</i>.	M.-M. should have felt pity - why did he smile? He thought of how the Buddha's wisdom and he too had prevailed, so that never could he come again to such a state. His exclamations were prompted by pity. Lakkhana could also have seen the vision, but he was not attending as a clairvoyant must.</p>
