					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthi at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p2" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.002.pali.bd.htm#p2">2</a>]</span> And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, brethren, both the wrong way and the right way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br />

					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord," responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Which, brethren, is the wrong way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance activities come to pass;<br />
					conditioned by activities consciousness,<br />
					conditioned by consciousness name-and-shape,<br />
