					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now thirty brethren only,<br />
					from <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#pava">Pāvā</a>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					all forest dwellers,<br />
					all almsmen,<br />
					all rag-robed,<br />
					all three-garment-men,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					all not yet fetter-free<br />
					came to the Exalted One<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at the side of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These thirty from Pāvā<br />
					all forest-dwellers,<br />
					all almsmen,<br />
					all rag-robed,<br />
					all three-garment-men,<br />
					all not yet fetter-free,<br />
					what if I were now so to teach them such a doctrine,<br />
					that at this very sitting<br />
					their hearts were to be liberated,<br />
					without grasping,<br />
					from the intoxicants?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So he addressed them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> they responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br />
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the running on,<br />
					the faring on<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the greater?</p>

					<p class="f4">The blood that has flowed,<br />
					that has been shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					as ye have run on,<br />
					fared on<br />
					this long while,<br />
					or the waters in the four seas?</p>

					<p class="f4">As we allow, lord,<br />
					that we have been taught by the Exalted One,<br />
					it is this that is greater,<br />
					even the blood that has flowed,<br />
					that has been shed<br />
					by the loss of our heads<br />
					as we have run on,<br />
					fared on<br />
					this long while,<br />
					and not the waters of the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said!<br />
					well said, brethren!<br />
					well do ye allow<br />
					that I have thus taught you the doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the blood that has flowed,<br />
					that has been shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					as you have run on,<br />
					fared on<br />
					this long while,<br />
					that is greater,<br />
					and not the waters of the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were oxen,<br />
					born as oxen,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were buffaloes,<br />
					born as buffaloes,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were rams<br />
					born as rams,<br />

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were as wild beasts,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					born as wild beasts,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were fowls,<br />
					born as fowls,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were swine<br />
					born as swine,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were seized as robbers,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were seized as village-plunderers,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were seized as highwaymen,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many a long day<br />
					did blood flow,<br />
					was blood shed<br />
					by the loss of your heads<br />
					when ye were seized as adulterers,<br />
					more blood than there are waters in the four seas.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brethren,<br />
					of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of beings running on,<br />
					faring on,<br />
					cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brethren,<br />
					have ye been suffering ill,<br />
					have ye been suffering pain,<br />
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br />
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />
					for you to be repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleased at heart<br />
					those brethren took delight<br />
					in that which was spoken by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And during the speaking of this catechism<br />
					the hearts <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> of the thirty Pāvā brothers were set free,<br />
					without any grasping,<br />
					from the intoxicants.</p>
