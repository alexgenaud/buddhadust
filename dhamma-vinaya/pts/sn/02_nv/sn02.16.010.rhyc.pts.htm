					<p class="f4">The venerable Mahā-Kassapa was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda, robing himself at an early hour and taking his bowl and robe, went into the presence of the venerable Mahā-Kassapa,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said to the venerable Mahā-Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, your reverence,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to a certain sisters' settlement."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go thou, friend Ānanda,<br />
					thou art a man of many duties,<br />
					of much work."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Ānanda said to the venerable Mahā-Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, your reverence,<br />
					to a certain sisters' settlement."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Mahā-Kassapa responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go thou, friend Ānanda,<br />
					thou art a man of many duties,<br />
					of much work."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Ānanda said to the venerable Mahā-Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, your reverence,<br />
					to a certain sisters' settlement."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā-Kassapa<br />
					at that early hour<br />
					robing himself<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					with Ānanda walking as attendant behind him,<br />
					went to that certain sisters' settlement<br />
					and sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of sisters came before Mahā-Kassapa,<br />
					and saluted him<br />
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those sisters so seated<br />
					the venerable Mahā-Kassapa instructed by a religious talk,<br />
					enlightening,<br />
					inciting,<br />
					and inspiring them.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the sister Fat Tissa was not pleased,<br />
					and gave vent to words of displeasure:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What! does Father<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Mahā-Kassapa deem he is to speak doctrine<br />
					in the presence of Father Ānanda<br />
					the learned sage?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if the needle-pedlar<br />
					were to deem he could sell a needle<br />
					to the needlemaker!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa heard<br />
					that Fat Tissa the sister<br />
					was talking like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, now, friend Ānanda,<br />
					am I the needle-pedlar<br />
					and you the needlemaker,<br />
					or am I the needlemaker<br />
					and you the needle-pedlar?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be indulgent, your reverence,<br />
					women are foolish."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, come, friend Ānanda,<br />
					let not the Order inquire further concerning thee.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this what thinkest thou, friend Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Was it thou whom the Exalted One brought before the Order, saying:</p>
