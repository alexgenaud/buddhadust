<meta name="description" content="The C.A.F. Rhys Davids' translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 2. Nidana Vagga, 14 Dhatu Samyutta, Sutta 33. The Buddha describes how if there were no satisfaction to be got from the properties of solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion, there would be no lust for them, how if there were no pain associated with them there would be no dissatisfaction with them, how if there were no way to escape from them there would be no escaping from them, but since there is, there is, and that it is only insofar as one has understood these things as they are that there is any living of the religious life and attaining to freedom." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were not, brethren,<br />
					this satisfaction that comes from the earth-element,<br />
					beings would not lust after the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as there is,<br />

					beings could not escape from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as that there is<br />

					<p class="f4">But when, brethren,<br />

					in these four elements,<br />
					then do beings live aloof,<br />
