					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.008.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/wp/sn/02_nv/sn02.16.008.bodh.wp.htm#p1">bodh</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and sat down at his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br />
					the Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Exhort the brethren, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give them discourse on doctrine, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I, Kassapa, or thou<br />
					must exhort the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Either I or thou<br />
					must give them discourse on doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br />
					it is difficult to speak to the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just now, lord, it is difficult to speak to the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are in a state that makes it difficult to speak to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are intractable; they pay no deference to instruction."</p>

					<p class="f4">Yea, Kassapa, there was a time<br />
					when the senior brethren were forest dwellers<br />
					and commenders of the forest life,<br />
					almsmen were they<br />
					and they commended going for alms,<br />
					rag-robe wearers were they<br />
					and they commended rag-robe wearing,<br />
					three-garment men were they<br />
					and they commended the triple-raiment;<br />
					of little wants were they,<br />
					and they commended few wants;<br />
					contented were they,<br />
					and they commended contentment;<br />
					secluded were they,<br />
					and they commended seclusion;<br />
					aloof from society were they,<br />
					and they commended such aloofness;<br />
					strenuous in energy were they,<br />
					and they commended such strenuous energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brother who was a forest dweller<br />
					and commender of the forest life,<br />
					almsman<br />
					and commendeder of going for alms,<br />
					rag-robe wearer<br />
					and commendeder of rag-robe wearing,<br />
					three-garment man<br />
					and commendeder of the triple-raiment;<br />
					of little wants,<br />
					and commendeder of few wants;<br />
					contented,<br />
					and commendeder of contentment;<br />
					secluded,<br />
					and commendeder of seclusion;<br />
					aloof from society,<br />
					and commendeder of such aloofness;<br />
					strenuous in energy,<br />
					and commendeder of such strenuous energy,<br />
					the senior brethren would invite to a seat,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Kassapa, the novice <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> who was a forest dweller<br />
					and commender of the forest life,<br />
					almsman<br />
					and commendeder of going for alms,<br />
					rag-robe wearer<br />
					and commendeder of rag-robe wearing,<br />
					three-garment man<br />
					and commendeder of the triple-raiment;<br />
					of little wants,<br />
					and commendeder of few wants;<br />
					contented,<br />
					and commendeder of contentment;<br />
					secluded,<br />
					and commendeder of seclusion;<br />
					aloof from society,<br />
					and commendeder of such aloofness;<br />
					strenuous in energy,<br />
					and commendeder of such strenuous energy,<br />
					the senior brethren would invite to a seat,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They practised that they might so attain;<br />
					that made for many a day<br />
					for their good,<br />
					for their happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, Kassapa, the senior brethren<br />
					are neither forest dwellers,<br />
					nor do they commend forest life;<br />
					they are neither almsmen,<br />
					nor do they commend going for alms;<br />
					they are neither rag-robe men,<br />
					nor do they commend rag-robe wearing;<br />
					they are neither three-garment men,<br />
					nor do they commend the triple-raiment;<br />
					they are neither of little wants,<br />
					nor do they commend few wants;<br />
					they are neither contented,<br />
					nor do they commend contentment;<br />
					they are neither secluded,<br />
					nor do they commend seclusion;<br />
					they are neither aloof from society,<br />
					nor do they commend such aloofness;<br />
					they are neither strenuous in energy,<br />
					nor do they commend such strenuous energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is that the brother who is known,<br />
					is of repute,<br />
					one who gets presents of raiment,<br />
					alms,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medical requisites -<br />
					him it is that the senior brethren invite to a seat,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Who may this brother be?</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome indeed is this brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Anxious to learn truly is this brother!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Kassapa, the novice who is known,<br />
					is of repute,<br />
					one who gets presents of raiment,<br />
					alms,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medical requisites -<br />
					him it is that the senior brethren invite to a seat,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, brother, take this seat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They practise that they may so attain.</p>

					<p class="f4">That makes for many a day<br />
					for their hurt<br />
					and for their sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">If anyone, Kassapa, were to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'They who lead the religious life<br />
					are harassed by its own dangers;<br />
					they who lead the religious life<br />
					are fighters of that which assails it,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he would thereby be saying that which is right.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> See <i>*brahmacārī.</i> The dangers 'within the fold,' B. explains, are excessive desire for material comforts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>*brahmacārī.</i> The inflexions in this sentence are puzzling. One would think the text should read <i>'upaddutā brahmacārino ... abhibhūta brahmacārino.</i> The printed S. text of the <i>Comy.</i> says, that Burmese texts read <i>abhitthanā</i> for <i>abhibhavanā.</i> This does not help. p. 141.</p>
