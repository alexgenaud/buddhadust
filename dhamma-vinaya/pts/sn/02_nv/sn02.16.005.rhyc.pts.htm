					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					at the Bamboo Grove:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Kassapa came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and sat down at his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br />
					the Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thou art old, Kassapa,<br />
					and these coarse cast-off rags<br />
					are past wearing<br />
					and irksome to thee.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore do thou, Kassapa,<br />
					wear the raiment [given] by householders<br />
					and enjoy their invitations<br />
					and abide near me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, lord, for many a day<br />
					have been a forest dweller<br />
					and have commended forest life;<br />
					have been an almsman<br />
					and have commended alms-living;<br />
					have been a rag-robe wearer<br />
					and have commended rag-robe wearing;<br />
					have been a three-garment man<br />
					and have commended the triple-raiment;<br />
					have wanted little<br />
					and have commended few wants;<br />
					have been contented<br />
					and have commended contentment;<br />
					have dwelt in seclusion<br />
					and have commended seclusion;<br />
					have held aloof from society<br />
					and have commended such aloofness;<br />
					have lived in strenuous energy<br />
					and have commended strenuous energy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what advantage dost thou, Kassapa,<br />
					discern in this<br />
					that for many a day<br />
					thou hast been a forest dweller<br />
					and have commended forest life;<br />
					have been an almsman<br />
					and have commended alms-living;<br />
					have been a rag-robe wearer<br />
					and have commended rag-robe wearing;<br />
					have been a three-garment man<br />
					and have commended the triple-raiment;<br />
					have wanted little<br />
					and have commended few wants;<br />
					have been contented<br />
					and have commended contentment;<br />
					have dwelt in seclusion<br />
					and have commended seclusion;<br />
					have held aloof from society<br />
					and have commended such aloofness;<br />
					have lived in strenuous energy<br />
					and have commended strenuous energy?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Discerning two advantages, lord,<br />
					have I for many a day<br />
					been a forest dweller<br />
					and have commended forest life;<br />
					have been an almsman<br />
					and have commended alms-living;<br />
					have been a rag-robe wearer<br />
					and have commended rag-robe wearing;<br />
					have been a three-garment man<br />
					and have commended the triple-raiment;<br />
					have wanted little<br />
					and have commended few wants;<br />
					have been contented<br />
					and have commended contentment;<br />
					have dwelt in seclusion<br />
					and have commended seclusion;<br />
					have held aloof from society<br />
					and have commended such aloofness;<br />
					have lived in strenuous energy<br />
					and have commended strenuous energy:</p>

					<p class="f4">Discerning mine own present happiness<br />
					and being filled with compassion<br />
					for them who will come after us.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely these may fall into error.</p>

					<p class="f4">But let them say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They who were disciples of the Buddha<br />
					and of the followers of the Buddha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					were for many a day<br />
					forest dwellers<br />
					and commended forest life;<br />
					they were almsmen<br />
					and commended alms-living;<br />
					they were rag-robe wearers<br />
					and commended rag-robe wearing;<br />
					they were three-garment men<br />
					and commended the triple-raiment;<br />
					they were of few wants<br />
					and commended few wants;<br />
					they were contented<br />
					and commended contentment;<br />
					they dwelt in seclusion<br />
					and commended seclusion;<br />
					they held aloof from society<br />
					and commended such aloofness;<br />
					they lived in strenuous energy,<br />
					and they commended strenuous energy,'|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying they will practise that<br />
					so they <a id="pg137"><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></a> may attain this end.</p>

					<p class="f4">This for many a day<br />
					will be for their good<br />
					and for their happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two advantages, lord,<br />
					the which discerning<br />
					I have for many a day<br />
					lived on this wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well said, well said, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the good of many,<br />
					truly, hast thou thus practised,<br />
					for the happiness of many folk,<br />
					out of compassion for the world,<br />
					for the salvation,<br />
					the good,<br />
					the happiness<br />
					of devas and of men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Kassapa,<br />
					wear thou thy coarse rag-robes<br />
					that are past wearing,<br />
					go thy rounds for alms<br />
					and dwell in the forest."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Buddhānubuddhasāvakā.</i> B. is silent, though extremely wordy on the former advantage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa judges that the Master intentionally afforded his great follower opportunity here to 'roar his lion's roar.'</p>
