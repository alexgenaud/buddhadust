<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya, Nidana Vagga: 19: Lakkhana-Samyutta: Sutta 6. Lakkhana asks the venerable Maha-Moggallāna to explain the reason that he smiled on their way to Rājagaha. Maha-Moggallāna tells of having seen a ghost suffering great torments. The Buddha says that he too has seen this ghost and reveals the reason it is experiencing such a fate. One in a series that comprise this chapter which should all be read together.">

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.19.006.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/lakkhana.htm">Lakkhana</a> and the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Mahā-Moggallāna</a> were staying at Vulture's Peak hill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna rising at an early hour<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					went to see the venerable Lakkhana and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let us go, friend Lakkhana,<br />
					and enter Rājagaha for alms.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Lakkhana consented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					as he was descending the hill<br />
					and passing a certain place<br />
					smiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Lakkhana said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause, friend Moggallāna,<br />
					that you smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not the right time for that question, friend Lakkhana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask me the question in the Exalted One's presence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the twain had made their alms-round in Rājagaha,<br />
					had dined<br />
					and come away from their meal,<br />
					they went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and took their seat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					the venerable Lakkhana said to Mahā-Moggallāna:-</p>

					<p class="f4">'As the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna was descending Vulture's Peak hill just now,<br />
					as he came to a certain place<br />
					he smiled:-</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the reason,<br />
					what was the cause for the smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just now, friend,<br />
					as I was descending Vulture's Peak hill,<br />
					I saw a man with bristles of javelins<br />
					going through the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">The javelins kept rising and falling<br />
					just on his body<br />
					while he uttered cries of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, friend, came this thought:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"0 but this is wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 but this is marvellous<br />
					that a person will come to have such a shape,<br />
					that the individuality acquired<br />
					will come to have such a shape!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Disciples, brethren, live the life of vision,<br />
					yea, of insight,<br />
					since a disciple will know,<br />
					or will see,<br />
					or will testify<br />
					to a thing like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">I also, brethren, had seen that being before now,<br />
					yet I did not reveal it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I might have revealed it,<br />
					and others would not have believed me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had they not believed me,<br />
					it would have been to their hurt and their sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This being, brethren,<br />
					was a deer-hunter<br />
					in this very Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He by the effect of that work<br />
					has been punished for many years,<br />
					for many hundreds,<br />
					nay, hundred thousands of years<br />
					in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now by the remaining effect of that work<br />
					he has acquired a personality<br />
					of that kind.'</p>
