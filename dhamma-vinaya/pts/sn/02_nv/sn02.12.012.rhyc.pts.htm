<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Ahara Vagga), Sutta 12. After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food. Gotama responds correcting his thinking from 'who feeds?' to 'what results from feeding on?', which leads into the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada)." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park:</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these four sustenances, brethren,<br />
					for the maintenance of beings<br />
					that have come to birth<br />
					or for the forwarding of them<br />
					that seek to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material food,<br />
					coarse or fine, <br />
					secondly, contact, <br />
					thirdly, volition,<br />
					fourthly, consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four are the sustenances<br />

					that have come to birth,<br />
					or for the forwarding of those<br />
					that seek to become."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moḷiya-Phagguna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who now is it, lord,<br />
					who feeds on the consciousness-sustenance?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not saying [someone] feeds on.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br />
					to that the question would be a fit one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

					<p class="f4">this were a fit question.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fit answer to it is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The consciousness-sustenance<br />
					is the cause of renewed becoming,<br />
					of rebirth in the future.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When that <a id="pg10"><span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span></a> is come to pass,<br />
					is present,<br />
					the sixfold sense-sphere becomes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by the sixfold sense-sphere<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who now, lord, exercises contact?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not a fit question," said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not saying [someone] exercises contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br />
					the question would be a fit one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I not saying so,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Conditioned now by what, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">this were a fit question.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fit answer there would be:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by contact is feeling.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were saying so,<br />
					the question would be a fit one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by craving<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who now, lord, is it who grasps?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not a fit question, said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not saying [someone] grasps.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were saying so, the question would be a fit one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I am not saying so.</p>

					<p class="f4">this were a fit question.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fit answer there would be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Conditioned by craving<br />
					is grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by grasping<br />
					is becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">conditioned by becoming, birth;<br />

					come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising<br />
					of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and cessation<br />
					of the sixfold <a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a> sphere of sense-contact, Phagguna,<br />

Why, asks the <i>Comy.,</i> does he leave out the other three? Because they are more obvious conditions of effects. He could see anyone eating food, could easily understand contact-sustenance, say, of a bird feeding its young, and thoughtful volition as when a turtle lays her eggs in sand above high water mark. But the (new and yet old) mind, that will continue to function in a new body in the process of rebirth, was not so easy to bring under the notion of a 'sustenance,' which conditions the appearance of a new compound or name-and-shape.</p>
