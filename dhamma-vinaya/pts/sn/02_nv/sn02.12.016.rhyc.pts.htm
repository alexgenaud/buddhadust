<meta name="description" content="The C.A.F. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 2.12, Nidana Vagga, Sutta 16. The Buddha describes how if one teaches even only one link in the paṭicca samuppāda one may be called a Dhamma Teacher; if one practices only one link one may be called one who lives the Dhamma of the Dhamma; if one experiences freedom as a consequence of the experience of only one link one may be said to have won Nibbāna in this life. He repeats this three-fold formula for each of the links." />
