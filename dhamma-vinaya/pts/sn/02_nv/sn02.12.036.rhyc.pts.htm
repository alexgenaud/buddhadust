<meta name="description" content="Mrs. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 4. Kalarakhattiyo Vagga), Sutta 36. The Buddha explains that questions concerning 'what and who' experiences the various stages of the paṭicca samuppāda assume the idea of an individual or experiencer, and a differentiation between the experience and the experiencer and that such an assumption falls into the trap of postulating an eternal self or a self that is annihilated and that with either of those two extreme views it is not possible to end pain and reach the goal of Arahantship and that this amounts to blindness, but by bringing this blindness to an end and seeing that the process is impersonal the end of pain is attainable and the goal of Arahantship can be reached." />
