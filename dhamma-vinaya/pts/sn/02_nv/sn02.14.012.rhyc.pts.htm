					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Kāma</i> means literally desire, but with sense-experience as its constant context. Unlike <i>chando,</i> translated 'desire' just below, it has no conational emphasis. It bears, in Buddhist doctrine, almost the sense of 'carnal' in Christian homiletics. It is a name for all life from the lowest up to and inclusive of the nearer, <i>i.e.,</i> more akin-to-earth deva-spheres. For here too is 'incarnate' life and carnal desire. The difficulty of translating it is obvious. See <i>Ency. Religion and Ethics,</i> 'Desire'; <i>Compendium,</i> 81, n. 2; <i>Bud. Psych. Ethics,</i> p. 334. The antithetical term, 'renunciation': - <i>nekkhamma</i> - is not from the same root but from <i>kram,</i> going forth. The other two antithetical terms - benevolence, kindness - are negative in form, lit. non-enmity, harmlessness, but are not necessarily so in meaning. <i>E.g.,</i> the latter, in the Sutta-Nipāta <i>Comy.,</i> is paraphased as <i>sa-karuṇabhāvo,</i> state of feeling pity, and pity is actively conceived by Buddhaghosa, <i>Vis. Mag.,</i> p. 314  <i>f.,e.g.,</i> 'the not being able to endure the sufferings of others.'</p>
