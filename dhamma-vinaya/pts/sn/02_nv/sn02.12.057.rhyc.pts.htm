					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In him, brethren, who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br />
					in all that makes for enfettering,<br />
					craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					despair come to pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the uprising of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if, brethren, there were a tender sapling,<br />
					and a man were from time to time to clear around<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the roots,<br />
					were from time to time to give it earth,<br />
					were from time to time to give it water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, brethren, such a tender sapling<br />
					so fed,<br />
					so given nutriment,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> would attain to growth,<br />
					to development,<br />
					to abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the enjoyment that there is<br />
					in all that makes for enfettering,<br />
					craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grasping is conditioned by craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming is conditioned by grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is conditioned by becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay-and-death is conditioned by birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />

					<a id="pg63"><span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span></a> suffering,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, brethren, who contemplates the misery that there is<br />
					in all that makes for enfettering,<br />
					craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a tender sapling;<br />
					and a man were to come with axe and basket,<br />
					and were to cut down that tree at the root,<br />
					and were then to dig a trench<br />
					and were to pull out the roots<br />
					even to the rootlets<br />
					and root-fibres.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he were to cut the sapling into logs,<br />
					and were then to split the logs,<br />
					and were then to make the logs into chips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he were to dry the chips in wind and sun,<br />
					then burn them by fire,<br />
					then make an ashheap,<br />
					then winnow the ashes in a strong wind,<br />
					or let them be borne down<br />
					by the swift stream of a river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily that sapling<br />
					thus cut down at the root<br />
					would be made as a palmtree stump,<br />
					a no-thing,<br />
					incapable of growing again in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so in him who contemplates the misery that there is<br />
					in all that makes for grasping,<br />
					craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving ceases, grasping ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When grasping ceases becoming ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When becoming ceases birth ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">When birth ceases decay-and-death ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					despair cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the ceasing of this entire mass of ill."</p>
