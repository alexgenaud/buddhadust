					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, meditating in solitude,<br />
					gave utterance to that way<br />

					<p class="f4">"Because of sight and visible objects<br />
					visual consciousness arises,<br />

					<p class="f4">And at that time a certain brother stood overhearing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One saw him standing and overhearing,<br />

					he spake thus unto him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Didst thou hear, brother,<br />
					this our way of setting forth the Doctrine?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do thou learn this way, brother,<br />
					do thou master it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It belongs to thy good, brother,<br />
					this way of setting forth the Doctrine,<br />
					it is of the rudiments of the divine life."</p>
