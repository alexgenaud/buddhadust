					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side<br />
					he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How long, lord, is an aeon?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long, brother, is an aeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reckon how long<br />
					by saying so many years,<br />
					so many centuries,<br />
					so many thousand centuries."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can it be told, lord, by a parable?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can, brother", said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brother, there were a great crag,<br />
					a hill one yojana wide,<br />
					one yojana across,<br />
					one yojana high<br />
					without chasms or clefts,<br />
					a solid mass.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a man at the end of every hundred years<br />
					were to stroke it <a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> once each time<br />
					with a Kasi cloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, that mountain<br />
					in this way<br />
					would be sooner done away with<br />
					and ended<br />
					than would an aeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long, brother, is an aeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of aeons thus long<br />
					more than one has passed,<br />
					more than a hundred have passed,<br />
					more than a thousand,<br />
					more than a hundred thousand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brother, of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the faring on, running on,<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brother,<br />
					have ye been suffering ill,<br />
					have ye been suffering pain,<br />
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br />
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brother,<br />
					for you to be repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>
