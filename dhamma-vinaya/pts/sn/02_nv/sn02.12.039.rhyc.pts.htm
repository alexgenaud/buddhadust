					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a><br />

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which we will, brethren,<br />
					and that which we intend to do<br />
					and that wherewithal we are occupied: -<br />
					this becomes an object<br />
					for the persistence of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The object being there,<br />
					there comes to be a station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness being stationed<br />
					and growing,<br />
					there comes to pass descent of name-and-shape;<br />
					because of name-and-shape, sense;<br />
