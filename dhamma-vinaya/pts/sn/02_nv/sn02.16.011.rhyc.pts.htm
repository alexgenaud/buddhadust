					<p class="f4">The venerable Mahā-Kassapa was once staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the venerable Ānanda was making a tour about the Southern Hills<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with a great company of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					as many as thirty brethren,<br />
					followers of <a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> Ānanda,<br />
					and for the most part youths,<br />
					had renounced the training,<br />
					and turned to low things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda<br />
					when he had toured in the Southern Hills<br />
					as long as it pleased him,<br />
					came to Rājagaha,<br />
					and going to the Bamboo Grove,<br />
					to the Squirrels' Feeding-ground,<br />
					he entered the venerable Mahā-Kassapa's presence,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br />
					Mahā-Kassapa said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What were the several advantages, friend<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span>, Ānanda,<br />
					on account of which were<br />
					'three only at a meal'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					prescribed by the Exalted One<br />
					for the families?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are three advantages, your reverence, Kassapa,<br />
					on account of which was<br />
					'three only at a meal'<br />
					prescribed by the Exalted One<br />
					for the families,<br />
					namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">[1] For restraining ill-natured persons,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					[2] for the well-being of pious brethren,<br />
					(lest evil-wishers, backed by a clique, should bring discord into the Order),<br />
					[3] and for the tender care of the families.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is these three advantages<br />
					on account of which was<br />
					'three only at a meal'<br />
					prescribed by the Exalted One<br />
					for the families."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Then why on earth dost thou, friend Ānanda,<br />
					tour about with these young brethren<br />
					who have the gates of their senses unguarded,<br />
					who are without moderation in their food,<br />
					who are not devoted to vigils?</p>

					<p class="f4">Corn-trampler methinks art thou!</p>

					<p class="f4">Despoiler of the families methinks art thou!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thy following, friend Ānanda,<br />
					is breaking up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thy youngsters, friend,<br />
					are melting away!</p>

					<p class="f4">This boy does not know his own measure!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence,<br />
					and yet we are not vexed at the venerable Mahā-Kassapa<br />
					even at this time of day<br />
					calling us 'boy.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, friend Ānanda,<br />
					it is thus that thou goest on tour<br />
					with these new brethren<br />
					who have the gates of their senses unguarded,<br />
					who are without moderation in their food,<br />
					who are not devoted to vigils.</p>

					<p class="f4">Corn-trampler methinks art thou!</p>

					<p class="f4">Despoiler of the families methinks art thou!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thy following, friend Ānanda,<br />
					is breaking up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thy youngsters, friend,<br />
					are melting away!</p>

					<p class="f4">This boy does not know his own measure!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> Now sister Fat Tissa heard that Father Ānanda<br />
					the learned sage<br />
					had been chidden<br />
					and called 'boy'<br />
					by Father Mahā-Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then sister Fat Tissa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn3" href="#edn3">ed3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					displeased<br />
					gave vent to her displeasure saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What now!<br />
					does Father Mahā-Kassapa,<br />
					who was once a heretical teacher,<br />
					deem that he can chide Father Ānanda<br />
					the learned sage,<br />
					calling him 'boy'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Great Kassapa<br />
					heard that sister Fat Tissa was talking thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In faith, friend Ānanda,<br />
					it is an outrageous<br />
					and a thoughtless word<br />
					that Sister Fat Tissa has been saying,<br />
					seeing that I, friend,<br />
					when I cut off my hair<br />
					and donned the saffron raiment<br />
					and went forth from home into the homeless,<br />
					acknowledged myself learner from no teacher<br />
					save the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I was still leading house-life, friend,<br />
					this came to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Stuffy it is to live in a house,<br />
					a dusty procedure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as air<br />
					is life out of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not easy is this,<br />
					that one dwelling in the house<br />
					should lead the divine life<br />
					entirely perfect,<br />
					entirely pure as a polished shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me now shave my hair,<br />
					don the saffron raiment<br />
					and go forth from home<br />
					into the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I, friend,<br />
					later on<br />
					had an under-robe made of cut cloth<br />
					and, following the example of the world's Arahants,<br />
					I shaved my head,<br />
					donned the saffron robes<br />
					and left home for the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having thus left the world,<br />
					and being on the highway between Rājagaha and Nalanda,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saw the Exalted One seated at the shrine of the Many Children,<br />
					and seeing him I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 to think that I may see the Master,<br />
					the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 to think that I may see the Well-Farer,<br />
					the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 to think that I may see the Supreme Buddha,<br />
					the Exalted One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And forthwith I fell prone<br />
					at the feet of the Exalted One<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My teacher, lord,<br />
					is the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">His disciple am I!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He, Kassapa, who,<br />
					not recognizing a disciple with his will thus fully made up,<br />
					should say<br />
					"I know,"<br />
					who not seeing him should say<br />
					"I <a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> see,"<br />
					his head would split asunder.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, Kassapa, recognizing say<br />
					"I know,"<br />
					seeing say<br />
					"I see."</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Kassapa,<br />
					thou must thus train thyself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There shall be a lively conscientiousness and discretion<br />
					manifested among seniors,<br />
					novices,<br />
					and them of middle status."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wherefore also, Kassapa,<br />
					thou must thus train thyself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever doctrine I shall hear,<br />
					bearing upon what is good,<br />
					to all that doctrine<br />
					I will hearken with attentive ear,<br />
					digesting it,<br />
					pondering on it,<br />
					gathering it all up with my will."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wherefore also, Kassapa,<br />
					thou must thus train thyself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Happy mindfulness<br />
					with respect to the body<br />
					shall not be neglected by me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Yea, thus must thou train thyself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, friend,<br />
					when he had thus exhorted me,<br />
					rose from his seat and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, friend,<br />
					for seven days,<br />
					not yet liberated,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					ate the country's alms;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on the eighth day<br />
					arose in me assurance of salvation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it happened, friend,<br />
					that the Exalted One came off the road<br />
					and went up to the roots of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I folded my under-robe of cut cloths<br />
					into a square<br />
					and said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the lord the Exalted One sit down hereon,<br />
					that it may be for many a day<br />
					to my good and happiness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One sat down<br />
					on the seat I had prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to me this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Soft, Kassapa, is thy underrobe of patched cloths.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Would the lord, the Exalted One, accept from me<br />
					the under robe of patched cloths<br />
					out of his compassion for me?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But wilt thou, Kassapa,<br />
					wear my rough rag-robes<br />
					that are past wear?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will wear, lord,<br />
					the Exalted One's rough rag-robes past wear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, friend, made a gift to the Exalted One<br />
					of my patched-cloth under-robe,<br />
					while I used the rough rag-robes past wear<br />
					of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, friend, if one might speak truly of me,<br />
					truly might <a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> he say<br />
					that here is a very son of the Exalted One,<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					born of the Norm,<br />
					created by the Norm,<br />
					heir of the Norm,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who has received from him<br />
					his rough cast-off rag-robes.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I, friend,<br />
					according as I desire [can],<br />
					aloof from sense and evil,<br />
					attain to<br />
					and abide in First Jhāna,<br />
					wherein thought is applied and sustained,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I, friend,<br />

					uplifting of will,<br />
					where is no applying and sustaining of thought,<br />
					which is born of concentration<br />
					and filled with zest and pleasant emotion.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I, friend,<br />
					according as I desire,<br />

					abiding with even mind,<br />
					mindful and discerning,<br />

					of that pleasant emotion<br />
					whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy doth he abide with even, lucid mind!</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I, friend,<br />
					according as I desire,<br />
					from putting away both pleasant and painful emotion,<br />

					[can] attain to<br />
					and abide in Fourth Jhāna,<br />
					that utterly pure lucidity<br />
					and indifference of mind,<br />
					wherein is neither happiness nor unhappiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I, friend,<br />
					according as I desire,<br />
					by passing entirely beyond the awareness of visible shapes,<br />
					by the dying out of the awareness of resistances,<br />
					by paying no heed to the awareness of diversity,<br />
					[can] attain to<br />
					and abide in<br />
					the conceptual sense of space as infinite,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Infinite is space.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I, friend,<br />
