					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.20.009.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi</a> at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a certain novice<br />
					spent too much time among the clansmen's houses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the brethren admonished him not to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He being spoken to said thus:-</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily these senior brethren<br />
					deem it permissible to go about<br />
					among the clansmen's houses;<br />
					why then should not I?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then many of the brethren<br />
					went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated they told him of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, brethren,<br />
					there was a great lake in a wooded region,<br />
					and elephants dwelt by it.</p>

					<p class="f4">They, plunging into the lake,<br />
					plucked up stalks and root-fibres of lotuses,<br />
					cleansed them well,<br />
					worked them free from mud and swallowed them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This made in them<br />
					for beauty and strength;<br />
					there was naught therein<br />
					whence they should suffer death or mortal pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">But following the example of those great elephants<br />
					tender baby-elephants<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> plunged into the lake,<br />
					plucked up stalks and <a id="pg181"><span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span></a> root-fibres of lotuses,<br />
					and swallowed them not cleansed,<br />
					and kneaded together all muddy.</p>

					<p class="f4">This made in them<br />
					neither for beauty nor for strength;<br />
					there was herein whence<br />
					they came to suffer death or mortal pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brethren, with us<br />
					when the senior brethren rise at an early hour<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					enter village or township for alms,<br />
					there they utter the doctrine<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the laymen pleased with them do their duty.</p>

					<p class="f4">They enjoy what they get<br />
					without greed or longing,<br />
					void of offence,<br />
					watchful of danger<br />
					and discerning their salvation.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus these things make in them<br />
					for beauty and strength;<br />
					there is naught therein<br />
					whence they should come to death<br />
					or to mortal pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">But novices, when they,<br />
					following the training of the senior brethren,<br />
					rise at an early hour,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe<br />
					enter village or town for alms,<br />
					there they utter the doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">The laity pleased with them do their duty.</p>

					<p class="f4">The novices enjoy what they get<br />
					greedily and with longing,<br />
					committing offence,<br />
					heedless of danger<br />
					and undiscerning their salvation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus these things do not make in them<br />
					for beauty or strength;<br />
					for that reason they come to death<br />
					or to mortal pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, brethren,<br />
					thus must ye train yourselves: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will enjoy what we get<br />
					without greed,<br />
					or longing,<br />
					or offence,<br />
					watchful of danger,<br />
					discerning our salvation'<br />
					­ even thus."</p>
