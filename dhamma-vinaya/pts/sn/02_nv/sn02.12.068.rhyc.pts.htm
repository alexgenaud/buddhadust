<meta name="description" content="The C.A.F. Rhys Davids translation of Samyutta Nikaya, 2.12, Nidana Vagga, Sutta 68. Venerable Savittha questions the Venerable Musila about whether or not apart from belief, inclination, hearsay, argument as to method, reflection on and approval of an opinion, he has, as his very own, the knowledge of the various steps of the Paticca Samuppada and of the knowledge that the ending of becoming is Nibbāna. In all cases he states that he has such knowldge. And when the Venerable Savittha declares him an arahant he remains silent. Then the Venerable Narada, who has overheard this dialogue asks that the same questions be asked of him and when asked he responds in the same way. But when Savittha pronounces him too an arahant, Narada explains that while he has personal knowledge of these things, he has not attained them. And he gives the simile of the thirsty man who comes across a well with no means to retrieve the water." />
