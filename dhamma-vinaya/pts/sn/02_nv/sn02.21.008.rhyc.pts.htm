					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Savatthī at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p2" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.008.pali.bd.htm#p2">2</a>]</span> Now the venerable Nanda, nephew of the Exalted One's mother, donning robes that had been dressed on both sides,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> painting his eyes and taking a bright, clean bowl, went into the presence of the Exalted One, saluted him, and took his seat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p3" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.008.pali.bd.htm#p3">3</a>]</span> To him so seated the Exalted One said: —</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p4" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.008.pali.bd.htm#p4">4</a>]</span> 'Not meet is  it for thee, Nanda, who as a clansman, left the world infaith, going from home to the homeless, to don robes that have been dressed on both sides, to paint thine eyes and bear about a bright, spotless bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">Meet for thee, Nanda, is it that thou shouldst be a forest-dweller, an almsman and a ragged robeman, and that thou shouldst dwell unheeding desires of sense.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p5" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.008.pali.bd.htm#p5">5</a>]</span> The Exalted One spake this.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Wellfarer so saying, the Master spake this yet further: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Maybe some day shall I see<br />
					      Nanda a forest-votary,<br />
					      In gear cast out he knows not whence,<br />
					      His maintenance supplied<br />
					      By food he knows as cast aside,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					      Heedless to calls of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p6" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.21.008.pali.bd.htm#p6">6</a>]</span> Then the venerable Nanda after that became a forest-dweller and an almsman, and a rag-robeman, heedless as to desires of sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This method, corresponding posssibly to our 'presssing cloth,' is described as rapping with hand or mallet, and again rapping after reversing the cloth. <i>Cf. Dhammapada, Comy.</i> i, 37. On Nanda see <i>Udāna,</i> p. 21, <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 46. B. here states that he 'got himself up' to evoke an opinion from his cousin — either 'truly this little brother of mine is beautiful!' or a fault-finding — that he might dress accordingly for the rest of his life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> So the <i>Comy.</i> 'marked off when choice food is selected for the great folk.' <i>Cf. Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 144, <b>n.</b>1.</p>
