					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Incalculable is the beginning, brethren, of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the running on, the faring on,<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is greater: -<br />
					the flood of tears<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> shed by you<br />
					crying and weeping<br />
					as ye fare on,<br />
					run on this long while,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					united as ye have been<br />
					with the undesirable,<br />
					sundered as ye have been<br />
					from the desirable,<br />
					or the waters in the four seas?</p>

					<p class="f4">'As we allow, lord,<br />
					that we have been taught by the Exalted One,<br />
					it is this that is greater:<br />
					the flood of tears shed by us<br />
					crying and weeping<br />
					as we fare on,<br />
					run on this long while,<br />
					united as we have been<br />
					with the undesirable,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, brethren!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well do ye allow that so has the doctrine been taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly the flood of tears shed by you<br />

					The earliest point is not revealed<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brethren,<br />

					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be delivered therefrom."</p>
