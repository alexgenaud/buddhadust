					<p class="f4">Now the brother Kaḷāra of the nobles<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					went into the presence of the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and exchanging with him greetings<br />
					and the compliments of friendship and courtesy,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moliya-Phagguna,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> friend Sāriputta,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then that venerable brother<br />

					<p class="f4">"I gather that the venerable Sāriputta<br />

					<p class="f4">"<i>I</i> have no doubt about it, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But as to the future, friend?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not worried about it, friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Kaḷāra the noble rose from his seat,<br />
					went into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I know, lord, that the venerable Sāriputta<br />

					that there is nothing further of these conditions."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed a certain brother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come thou, brother, tell my word to Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master, friend Sāriputta, is speaking to you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord,"<br />

					<p class="f4">"The Master, friend Sāriputta, is speaking to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend,"<br />
					responded Sāriputta,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg39"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span></a> To him so seated the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not in these words, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"In whatever way, Sāriputta,<br />
					a clansman declares [the winning of saving] knowledge,<br />
					the declaration must be considered as such."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But did I not say, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus should I make answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is because, friend,<br />
