					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those brethren to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the earth-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the earth-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the earth-element.<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the water-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the water-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the water-element,<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the heat-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the heat-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the heat-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the heat-element,<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that satisfaction, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the air-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found that misery, brethren,<br />
					that comes from the air-element<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">I walked seeking the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">I found the escape, brethren,<br />
					from the air-element,<br />
					so that by insight<br />
					I saw it well.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long as I, brethren,<br />
					had not fully come to know<br />
					even as it really is<br />
					the satisfaction as such,<br />
					the misery as such,<br />
					the escape as such<br />
					that there is in the four elements,<br />
					so long did I not discern<br />
					what it was to be enlightened<br />
					with supreme enlightenment<br />
					with regard to the world and its deities -<br />
					its Maras,<br />
					its Brahmas -<br />
					and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, brethren,<br />
					had fully come to know<br />
					even as it really is<br />
					the satisfaction as such,<br />
					the misery as such,<br />
					the escape as such<br />
					that there is in the four elements,<br />
					then did I discern<br />
					what it is to be enlightened<br />
					with supreme enlightenment<br />
					with regard to the world and its deities,<br />
					its Maras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					and to the generations of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">And knowledge, insight arose in me<br />
					that sure is my emancipation of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the last birth!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is there no more rebecoming!</p>
