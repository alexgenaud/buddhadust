					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brethren, that a man should lay together on Sineru, lord of the hills,<br />
					seven grains of gravel as large as beans.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to that what think ye, brethren, which is more?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those seven grains of gravel as large as beans laid together,<br />
					or Sineru, lord of the hills?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just this is more, lord, even Sineru, lord of the hills.</p>

					<p class="f4">Small are seven grains of gravel laid together as large as beans.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not make up a hundredth,<br />
					a thousandth,<br />
					a hundred thousandth part<br />
					when compared with Sineru, lord of the hills -<br />
					those seven grains of gravel laid together as large as beans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brethren,<br />
					for the Ariyan disciple who has won vision,<br />
					for the person who <a id="pg100"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span></a> has understanding<br />
					this is the greater ill, to wit,<br />
					that which for him is wholly perished,<br />
					wholly finished;<br />
					little is the ill that remains,<br />
					not worth the hundredth part,<br />
					not worth the thousandth part,<br />
					not worth the hundred thousandth part<br />
					when measured with the former ill<br />
					which for him is wholly perished,<br />
					wholly finished,<br />
					to wit, a term of seven times.</p>

					<p class="f4">So great in good, brethren,<br />
					is it to be wise in the Norm;<br />
					so great in good is it<br />
					to have gained the eye of the Norm."</p>
