					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> explains papatā as a dart encased in a coiled sheath of twine, to be hurled by hand.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Luddakena,</i> lit. 'hunter-ish (thing).' The Burmese read <i>suttakena,</i> 'by this cord': — easier, but not therefore more plausible.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> gives, as clue to the elliptical Pali, that a thunderbolt destroys one life-span only, but gains, etc., bring a man to infinitely prolonged misery hereafter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The title should read <i>diddhaŋ,</i> with the <i>Comy.</i> This accepts the inclusion of <i>visallena: — visamakkhitena sallena, sattiyā.</i> But it should surely read visa-sallena?</p>
