					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a><br />

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brethren!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master!" responded those brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The well taught Ariyan disciple, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">'How now?</p>

					<p class="f4">What being, what comes to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">From the arising of what, what arises?</p>

					<p class="f4">There being what,<br />

					<p class="f4">There being what,<br />
					does sense come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">There being what,<br />
					does contact come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">There being what,<br />

					<p class="f4">There being what,<br />

					<p class="f4">Nay, brethren, the well taught Ariyan disciple has come to know,<br />
					without depending upon another,<br />
					that here:</p>

					<p class="f4">This being,<br />
					that comes to be;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being consciousness,<br />

					<p class="f4">That there not being feeling,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus it is he knows that thus this world ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, brethren, the Ariyan disciple thus knows as it really is<br />
					the coming to pass and the passing away of the world,<br />
					he is what we call an Ariyan disciple who has won the view,<br />
					he sees this Norm,<br />
					his is the knowledge of the trained man,<br />
					he has won to the stream of the Doctrine,<br />
					he is Ariyan with the insight of revulsion;<br />
					he stands knocking at the door of the Deathless."</p>
