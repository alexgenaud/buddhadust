					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads not <i>yāvad-eva</i> but <i>yāva deva-.</i> Its paraphrase is 'to be known by many (<i>bahujana viññeyyaŋ</i>) so far as there is the division as to devas and men (<i>deva manussehi paricchedo atthi</i>) in the ten-thousandfold-universe (<i>cakkavāḷe</i>) ... well manifested <i>by the Tathāgata</i>' I do not hink for a moment that the Sutta would have omitted <i>Tathāgatena,</i> had this been meant. The Suttas never do so. The success of the divine life is precisely in proportion as devas and men lead it and so manifest it.</p>
