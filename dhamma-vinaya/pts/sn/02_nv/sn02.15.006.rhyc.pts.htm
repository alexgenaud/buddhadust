					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.15.006.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain brother came to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at one side<br />
					he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How long, lord, is an aeon?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long, brother, is an aeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reckon how long<br />
					by saying so many years,<br />
					so many centuries,<br />
					so many thousand centuries."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can it be told, lord, by a parable?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It can, brother", said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, brother, there were a city of iron [walls]<br />
					one yojana in length,<br />
					one in width,<br />
					one yojana high,<br />
					filled up with mustard-seed<br />
					[to the top as if] turban-bound.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Therefrom a man were to take out<br />
					at the end of every hundred years<br />
					a mustard-seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That great pile of mustard-seed, brother,<br />
					would in this way<br />
					be sooner done away with and ended<br />
					than an aeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long, brother, is an aeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of aeons thus long<br />
					more than one has passed,<br />
					more than a hundred have passed,<br />
					more than a thousand,<br />
					more than a hundred thousand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Incalculable is the beginning, brother, of this faring on.</p>

					<p class="f4">The earliest point is not revealed<br />
					of the faring on, running on,<br />
					of beings cloaked in ignorance,<br />
					tied to craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a day, brother,<br />
					have ye been suffering ill,<br />
					have ye been suffering pain,<br />
					have ye been suffering disaster,<br />
					have the charnel-fields been growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far enough is there, brother,<br />
					for you to be repelled<br />
					by all the things of this world,<br />
					enough to lose all passion for them,<br />
					enough to be delivered therefrom.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
