					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This Chapter V. has already been translated into German by Windisch, <i>op. cit.,</i> and into English in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/022.verses.from.sn1.05.bhikkhuni.sn.htm">Psalms of the Sisters (Appendix).</a><br />
					I repeat the latter translation here to make some emendations, and to give a few commentarial elucidations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Her name was Selā, and as such she is numbered among the Theris, or senior sisters of the Anthology <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/008.three.verses.htm#fn30">(<i>Pss</i> p. 43, n. 4 [Ed. n.30]).</a> The <i>Saɱyutta</i> contains the more adequate rejoinder to the tempter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> B. states that Dark Wood (Andha-Vana) was a <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#gavuta"><i>gāvuta</i></a>, or 1/4 <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#yojana"><i>yojana</i></a> south of Sāvatthī (? about 1-1/2 miles), and was so called from having been the haunt of 500 bandits who gouged out the eyes of their victims (<i>akkhibhedapattā</i>). They had so treated Yasodhara the preacher, when he had collected moneys for repairing the Chetiya of Buddha Kassapa. Dark Wood should thus perhaps be better rendered Blind Wood, <i>Andhavana</i> meaning either. The grove, adds B., was then guarded by royal custodians, and was often visited by a brother or sister in quest of solitude.<br />
					<i>Viveka</i> may mean spiritual detachment, but the <i>Comy.</i> here specifies it as physical (<i>kāyavivek'atthikinī</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Lit. 'fall from.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Nissaranan ti nibbānaɱ.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Paññā,</i> equated by <i>paccavekkhana-ñāṇaɱ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.04.001-025.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.4.24">IV, 3, § 4.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Way and goal = <i>padaɱ</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Divā-vihārāya:</i> lit. 'for the day-sojourn.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Thānaɱ,</i> meaning both 'place' and 'opportunity.' B. explains it as Arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> On this delightfully impudent figure <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/008.three.verses.htm#pg45"><i>Sisters,</i> p. 45.</a> B. gives another application of it: insignificant understanding, or because taking her cotton wool in two fingers she cuts the thread. For aptness we commend Dharmapāla's figure of testing the boiling rice. [Ed.: The 'two-finger wit' 'testing the boiling rice' figure exists to this day in Italy. She takes grains of boiled rice between her fingers and squeezes to test their tenderness. This is the extent of her wisdom.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> 'The knowledge (<i>ñaṇa</i>) in the attainment of the fruitions proceeding,' lit. rolling on. For <i>vutta-&deg;</i> in the text, read <i>vatta&deg;</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Questions, says B., arising under the influence of natural desire, conceit, false opinion. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> 'Lean through paucity of flesh and blood.' <i>Comy.</i> The legend of Kisa-Gotamī, of whom we know only the family name: 'she of the Gotama's,' is the most widely known of almost all those that have survived concerning the earliest followers of the Buddha, thanks mainly to E. Arnold's <i>Light of Asia.</i> B. here repeats the story of the mustard-seed, and gives a prior account of the Gotamī, narrated more fully, not in the <i>Therigāthā</i> <i>Comy.</i>, but in that on <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v270"><i>Dhp.</i> ii, 270-5.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Verbatim as in <a href="#sn.1.5.2">§ 2.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> We give here a different rendering from Windisch's, which influenced that in <i>Pss. of the Sisters.</i> The <i>Comy.</i> sees in <i>accanta</i> simply <i>antam atītaɱ,</i> an end or term that is past, viz. of the days when marriage and maternity filled her life. <i>Bhāvan apuŋsakaɱ etaɱ:</i> — 'This is a sexless state; that which was for me the end of child-dying, that was also for me the end of men' [as males]. Men were 'that-endish,' ending there (<i>tad-antikā,</i> not <i>antikaɱ,</i> 'near at hand'). <i>Cf. anta-ko,</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/01_sagv/sn01.04.001-025.olds.bd.htm#sn.1.4.1">IV, 1, § 1,</a> and <i>antiyā,</i> the Singh, <i>v.l.</i> here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Of this Sister the <i>Comy.</i> tells nothing. Her name is equivalent to Victrix, and her verses coincide with the opening verses of Queen Khemā's longer poem <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/011.six.verses.htm#pg83">(<i>Sisters,</i> p. 83).</a> Between these two women, indeed, tradition has recorded a tie of companionship, if we may assume that Vijayā Then <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/011.six.verses.htm#LVII">(op. cit p. 91)</a> is the bhikkhuni of the Saɱyutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> gives the usual list of instruments <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/022.verses.from.sn1.05.bhikkhuni.sn.htm#n11">(see <i>op. cit.,</i> p. 183, n. 4).</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> I have modified the rendering given <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/022.verses.from.sn1.05.bhikkhuni.sn.htm#pg184"><i>op. cit.</i> p. 184</a>. B. pronounces <i>santā samāpatti,</i> 'the good attainment,' to mean only the eightfold 'worldly attainment' of <i>Jhāna</i> practised for rebirth, and not as an accessory in the quest for Arahantship. The former was 'good' so far as it went. 'Darkness,' as always, is a figure for ignorance. <i>Cf.</i> with the last lines in <a href="#sn.1.5.6">§ 6.</a> We have followed S.Z. Aung's views in discarding 'form' in this connection, because of its ambiguity. The belief was that, in the Rūpa heavens there was such sublimated matter as served for vision and hearing, not to speak of locomotion, but in the formless, Arūpa heavens life was of purely mental stuff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Nor concerning this redoubtable lady has B. aught new to say.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> On this tree and its appearance see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.256.rhyc.pts.htm#pg330"><i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 330.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> B. does not admit an alternative rendering for <i>dutiya,</i> such as Windisch finds in the <i>Therīgāthā Comy.</i> We do not find there such an alternative, unless, for <i>ekikā va,</i> we read <i>ekikā vā.</i> And we judge that, in ver. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/016.twelve.verses.htm#v230">230 of the <i>Sisters' Pss.</i>,</a> 'none to companion thee' ... should have been rendered 'no one can rival thee.' ... This does more justice to the literary quality of the verse. It was redundant to add anything as to her want of a chaperone after the word <i>ekā.</i><br />
				 	We follow Windisch in finding that Māra's fourth line <i>in the text,</i> absent in <i>Therigāthā,</i> is an intrusive errant from Uppalavaṇṇā's reply, where alone it fits, forming the second line. So we omit it. Nevertheless the <i>Comy.</i> accepts the intrusion, with the exegesis: 'Just as thou, come hither, meetest with neither acquaintance nor love, so they too (the sisters alluded to as less fair) would be even as thou art.' This seems a little pointless. It should be 'thou here alone, for all thy beauty, gettest no more credit than a plainer woman.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> On these curious features in Buddhist cosmogony we can find as yet no discussion to add to Childers' art: <i>Nimmānarati,</i> a definition given also in <i>Therīgāthā Comy.,</i> 169.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>Padhūpito. Cf.</i> above, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.041-050.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.1.41">I, 5, § 1.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> <i>Puthujjana,</i> lit. many-folk, the 'masses' or 'million,' <i>hoi polloi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Pāsaṇḍa</i> is exegetically derived from 'the snares (pāsā) of opinions thrown over the hearts of men.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> The <i>Saɱyutta</i> has the singular, the <i>Therīgāthā,</i> the plural.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> 'all [the mystery of the] factors of life and all [the mystery of] rebirth.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> <i>Bimbaɱ</i> 'applied to the individual organism' (<i>attabhāva</i>). <i>Comy.</i> Windisch renders by <i>Leib</i>, which does not include mind. The whole 5-aggregate person is meant. The same figure occurs in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.251.rhyc.pts.htm">Raṭṭhapāla's</a> and <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.260.rhyc.pts.htm">Ānanda's</a> verses: <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> ver. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.251.rhyc.pts.htm#v769">769;</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.260.rhyc.pts.htm#v1020">1020,</a> where body and mind are explicitly included.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> <i>Agha</i> is as vague as our 'evil,' hence we have taken into account B.'s <i>dukkha-patiṭṭhānattā attabhāvo.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Or condition (<i>hetu</i>); always, in Buddhist philosophy, understood as impersonal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> We have slightly altered here to get closer following of the original. <i>'Satta,'</i> 'being,' is used for living intelligent creatures in general, including <i>devas.</i> 'All souls' would be perhaps a better rendering, the emphasis in the word being upon a permanent entity held to reside in a perishable frame, the worst of heresies for Buddhism. 'In the ultimate or highest sense,' comments B., 'a "being" is not found (or known).' So <i>Kathāvatthu</i> (<i>Points of Controversy,</i> p. 8, n. 3). <i>Māra</i> was apparently pointing to himself or to Vajirā in 'harping on (<i>paccesi, cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.09.rhyt.pts.htm#n21"><i>Dialogues,</i> I, 252, n. 3;</a> lit. 'going back to'). In <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.060.rhyc.pts.htm#v60"><i>Theragāthā,</i> ver. 60,</a> <i>Comy.</i>, the verb is paralleled by <i>gavesanto,</i> seeking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> The suffering attending the life of the five aggregates. <i>Comy.</i> It is as if Vajirā went on to say: 'If you must have a unity, a unified notion that is perpetually present when the five aggregates are present, take Suffering rather than <i>Satta.</i> <i>There</i> is constancy of being for you, so only you see in that too the threefold pulse of life: — genesis, equilibrium, dying away.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> It is a curious accident that verses so famous and quoted in the Canon (<i>Kathā-vatthu</i>) and other works, <i>e.g. Mil.</i> i, 45, and by B. himself, <i>e.g. Visuddhi-magga,</i> ch. xviii, as these should (1) not be incorporated in the <i>Therīgāthā,</i> (2) receive so brief a notice in the <i>Comy.</i>, (3) be accompanied by no legend about their author.</p>
