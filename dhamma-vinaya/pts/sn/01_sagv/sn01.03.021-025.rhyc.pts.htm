					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now the King, the Kosalan Pasenadi,<br />
					came into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and after exchanging greetings with him<br />
					and compliments of friendship and courtesy,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, sire, whence come you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have been zealously busied, lord,<br />
					with all such matters as occupy kings —<br />

					who are drunk with the intoxication of authority,<br />
					yield indulgence to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> their greed for sensuous pleasures,<br />
					who have won security in their kingdoms<br />
					and live as conquerors of a wide area of land."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to that what think you, sire?</p>

					<p class="f4">'May it please you to know, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatever you can do, sire, do it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a man were to come to you from the west,<br />
					a man loyal and trustworthy,<br />
					and were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May it please you to know, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatever you can do, sire, do it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And you, sire, seized with mighty dread,<br />
					the destruction of human life so terrible,<br />
					rebirth as man so hard to obtain,<br />
					what is there that you could do?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In such a mighty peril, lord,<br />
					the destruction of human life so terrible,<br />
					rebirth as man so hard to obtain,<br />
					what else could I do<br />
					save to live righteously and justly<br />
					and work good and meritorious deeds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I tell you, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">Yea, lord, such matters as battles<br />
					with elephant or horse cavalry,<br />
					with chariots, with infantry —<br />
					the business of kings of noble birth and anointed,<br />
					who are drunk with the intoxication of authority,<br />
					yield indulgence to their greed for sensuous pleasures,<br />
					who have won security in their kingdoms<br />
					and live as conquerors of a wide area of land -<br />
					these cannot come to pass,<br />
					there is no scope for these<br />

					<p class="f4">There are mighty counsellors, lord,<br />

					able by their spells<br />
					to arrest advancing foes.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there is, lord,<br />
					at my court an immense gold supply,<br />
					heaped in vaults<br />
					and upper floors,<br />
					enough to enable us to frustrate<br />
					an attack by financial strategy.</p>

					<p class="f4">These battles of spells<br />
					and of finance<br />
					cannot come to pass,<br />
					there is no scope for them<br />
					with old age and death rolling in upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">With old age and death <a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> rolling in upon me,<br />
					what is there that I can do<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, sire, even so.</p>

					<p class="f4">What else is there that you can do,<br />
					save to live righteously and justly<br />
					and to work good and meritorious deeds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One, and the Master said: —</p>

							Noble and brahmin, commoner and serf,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> pictures this interview as a public one. Among the large audience are rival teachers, self-consciously 'scratching the ground with their feet.' They had suffered in popularity through Gotama's rising fame, and had represented him as exhorting the people	to give to him and his followers only. The king summons the meeting to let him vindicate himself.</p>

He was warned in time, and had the wood surrounded, capturing and impaling or crucifying the bandits on either side of the way leading through the wood. The Teacher judged that if the king, who came on red-handed to him, were taxed with the horrid deed, he would become sullen and not countermand anything. Hence the method adopted in this impressive dialogue.<br />
					It does not fit well, however, and the king would scarcely be referring to the gens d'arme work he had been doing in the wood by such expressions as 'battle* (<i>hatihi-yuddhāni,</i> etc.) and the rest. Nor does the <i>Comy.</i> tell of any repentant action at the end.</p>
