					<p class="f4">On one occasion when the Exalted One was at Sāvatthi<br />
					the brahmin Sangārava<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was living there,<br />
					and he was a Purity-by-Water man<br />
					believing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> in purification by water;<br />
					evening and morning he made a religious practice<br />
					of going down into the water.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg232"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span></a> Now the venerable Ānanda<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> rising early and dressing himself,<br />
					took bowl and robe<br />
					and went into Sāvatthì for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Making his tour he dined,<br />
					and on his return went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he told the Exalted One<br />
					of the views of Sangārava the brahmin,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be well, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would visit the dwelling<br />
					of Sangārava the brahmin,<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One silently consented.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the next morning early<br />
					the Exalted One dressed himself,<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					set out for the dwelling of Sangārava the brahmin<br />
					and, when there,<br />
					seated himself on a seat that stood ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sangārava came up to the Exalted One,<br />
					and exchanging with him the greetings<br />
					and compliments of courtesy,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, to him the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it indeed true, brahmin,<br />
					that thou art a water-purifier,<br />
					and believest in purification by water;<br />
					and dost thou make it a religious practice<br />
					to go down into the water both evening and morning?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is so, Master Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what advantage, brahmin,<br />
					art thou looking for,<br />
					in that thou believest and actest on this wise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this way, Master Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">The evil deeds that I do during thè day,<br />
					these by my bathing<br />
					I cause to be borne away the same evening;<br />
					the evil deeds that I do at night,<br />
					these by my bathing<br />
					I cause to be borne away the next morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the advantage I look for,<br />
					in that I believe and act on this wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The Norm's a lake, virtue its strand for bathing,<br />
							Clear, undefiled, praised by the good to good men,<br />
							<a id="pg233"><span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span></a> Wherein in sooth masters of lore come bathing,<br />
							So, clean of limb, to the Beyond cross over."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When this was spoken,<br />
					Sangarava said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br />
					that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed<br />
					that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way<br />
					to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>
