					only in this Vagga. He interprets the name as the 'Hundred-Shouters' <i>(sat-ullapā)</i>. In their previous birth they were a ship's crew on a trading voyage. Their vessel was overwhelmed by stormy seas and sank, none escaping. During the storm the terrified crew noticed one only who, ' seated like a yogi,' was calm. He was thinking, not on his sins but on his good deeds. Of these he had enough and to spare to ensure happy rebirth, and the passengers implored his charity. He divided them into five groups of a hundred each, and shouted to them through the tempest the Five Precepts, one to each group, assuring them that to take these maxims on themselves would see them to a happy doom. As the waters rose in the ship they recited them and after death were reborn in Sakka's heaven, each with a noble golden <i>vimāna</i> (I, 2, § 10).

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> These, wrote B., formed no separate deva-world.

Because of their captious remarks the Theras, when editing these verses, gave them their name. The soubriquet is also given to a Thera in the <i>Dhp.
