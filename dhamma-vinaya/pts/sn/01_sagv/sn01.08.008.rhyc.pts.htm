					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at the Jeta Vana,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br />
					with a great company of twelve hundred and fifty brethren.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One was instructing,<br />
					enlightening,<br />
					inciting,<br />
					and inspiring the brethren by a sermon bearing on Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those brethren, with their whole mind applied,<br />
					attentive and intent,<br />
					listened with rapt hearing to the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaŋgīsa,<br />
					arising from his seat,<br />
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					bent his clasped hands saluting toward the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One!<br />
					it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaŋgīsa." Then the venerable Vaŋgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence with suitable verses: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"A thousand brethren, yea, and more than these<br />
							Attend around the Blessed One who here<br />
							Doth teach the Norm, the passionless, the pure,<br />
							Even Nibbāna, where can come no fear.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							They hearken to the Norm immaculate,<br />
							Taught by the Enlightened One Supreme.<br />
							0 wondrous fair the All-enlightened shines<br />
							'Mid all the Band of brethren as their chief.<br />
							Mysterious spirit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> thou, Exalted One,<br />
							The seventh in the lineage of the Seers,<br />
							Like a great storm-cloud [in the summer sky]<br />
							On thy disciples pouring plenteous rain.<br />
							<a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> And one of these from siesta-musing come,<br />
							Full fain his [gracious] Master to behold,<br />
							Thy true disciple, mighty Hero [see!],<br />
							Low at thy feet Vaŋgīsa worships thee."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say now, Vaŋgīsa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					were these verses thought out by thee beforehand,<br />
					or have they been revealed to thee just on the spot."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, these verses were not thought out by me beforehand;<br />
					they were revealed to me just on the spot."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, Vaŋgīsa,<br />
					let yet more verses,<br />
					not thought out beforehand,<br />
					be revealed to thee just on the spot."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord," replied Vaŋgīsa,<br />
					and in additional verses<br />
					not thought out beforehand<br />
					he extolled the Exalted One: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"O'er Māra's devious ways faring triumphant.<br />
							Thou breakest up the fallows of our hearts.<br />
							Behold him from all bondage our deliverer,<br />
							Himself full fraught<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> the harvest he imparts.<br />
							Yea, thou hast shown a Way by many methods<br />
							For crossing o'er the torrent safe to land;<br />
							And that Ambrosial thus manifested,<br />
							Norm-seers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> inexpugnable we stand.<br />
							Light-bringer, he hath pierced beyond, beholding<br />
							Past all those stations [where we end our flight],<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The topmost height knowing and realizing,<br />
							He showeth us that vantage-point of sight.<br />
							<a id="pg246"><span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span></a> Lo! now in truth so well revealed, for trifling<br />
							What place is there for those who learn his Lore?<br />
							Hence zealously within that Master's system<br />
							Train ye alway, and while ye train, adore."</p>
