					<p class="f4">A great number of brethren were once staying among the Kosalese<br />
					in a certain forest-tract.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were muddled in mind,<br />
					puffed up,<br />
					vain,<br />
					noisy,<br />
					loose of speech,<br />
					heedless,<br />
					unintelligent,<br />
					without concentration,<br />
					unsteady in mind,<br />
					uncontrolled in faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the deva who haunted that forest,<br />
					moved with compassion for those brethren,<br />
					desiring their welfare,<br />
					and wishing to agitate them,<br />
					drew near and addressed them in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Happy the bhikkhus as they lived of yore,<br />
							Who true disciples were of Gotama.<br />
							Unhankering they sought their frugal alms,<br />
							Unhankering, their lodging and their couch.<br />
							The impermanence of things they understood,<br />
							And hence of misery they made an end.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Now, making evil-doers of themselves,<br />
							Like headmen of the village [taking toll],<br />
							Longing for what their neighbours' house contains,<br />
							They eat and eat until they sink to rest.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The Order [as a whole] I humbly greet;<br />
							To some of those here met I homage pay.<br />
							Others, forlorn and leader-less are they,<br />
							As cast out bodies of the dead are they.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">My message is for them who heedless live.<br />
							To earnest diligent souls I say, All hail!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those brethren, agitated by the deva, were greatly moved.</p>
