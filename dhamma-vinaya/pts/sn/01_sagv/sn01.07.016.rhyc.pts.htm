					<p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi,<br />
					a brahmin named The Gainsayer<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was living at Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What if I were to go to visit the Samana Gotama,<br />
					and to whatever he says,<br />
					I were to maintain the opposite?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One<br />
					was walking to and fro in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Gainsayer drew nigh<br />
					and followed the Exalted One<br />
					as he walked to and fro,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Recite some doctrine, friar!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One:—]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Nay, not with thee, Gainsayer, with thine heart<br />
							Corrupt and full of animosity,<br />
							Sound thinking or sound speaking [shall I find].</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg227"><span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span></a> Whoso can strife and discord of the mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Suppress, and give up enmity, 't is he<br />
							In truth can apprehend what's soundly spoke."</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Gainsayer the brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br />
					that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed<br />
					that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way<br />
					to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways<br />
					made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Lit. Happy-in-gainsaying, or opposing. If some one said: 'it's all white,' he would say: 'it's all black,' etc. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Appasada,</i> the opposite of that pleasure arising from satisfaction which is harmony.</p>
