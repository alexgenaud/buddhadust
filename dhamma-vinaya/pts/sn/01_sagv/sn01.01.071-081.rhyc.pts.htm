					<p class="f4">There a certain deva, when the night was far spent, shedding radiance with his effulgent beauty over the entire Jeta Grove, came into the presence of the Exalted One, and coming, saluted him, and stood at one side. So standing, he spoke this verse before him: —</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads Jhatvā, not Chetvā, as do the Sinh. MSS. and Feer. In his MS. of the Comy, he found Ghatvā. I have retained *Jhatvā (having destroyed), as agreeing better with <i>vadhaɱ</i> (slaughter) in the context of the first <i>gāthā,</i> whence the Vagga derives its name. Spiritual 'cutting' (<i>chetvā</i>) is prescribed for taṇhā and doubt, but never, I believe, for anger.</p>
