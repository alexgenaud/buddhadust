					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once waiting near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#gaya">Gayā,</a><br />
					on the Stone Couch,<br />
					at the haunt of the yakkha Suciloma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					Khara the yakkha and Suciloma the yakkha<br />
					were passing by,<br />
					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Khara said to Suciloma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's a friar."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No [replied the other], that's not a friar,<br />
					that's a mere shaveling,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at least until I know<br />
					that he's the one and not the other."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Suciloma came up to the Exalted One<br />
					and bent his body up against him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One bent his body away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Suciloma said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dost fear me, friar?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, friend, I fear thee not,<br />
					albeit contact with thee is an evil thing."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg265"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span></a> "Friar, I will ask thee a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">If thou answerest me not,<br />
					I will either derange thy mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or split thy heart,<br />
					or I will take thee by the feet<br />
					and throw thee over the Granges."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I see no one, friend,<br />
					in the whole world,<br />
					be he Māra or Brahmā,<br />
					nor among gods or men<br />
					with all the recluses and the brahmins,<br />
					who is able to do to me<br />
					any one of these things;<br />
					nevertheless, friend,<br />
					ask according to thy desire."</p>

							The outcome,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> like the banyan's trunk-born runners,<br />

							<a id="pg266"><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></a> And they who know self and wherefrom it riseth,<br />
							They crush it down — listen to me, 0 yakkha —<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> An expressive statue of the yakkha Suciloma is among the bas-reliefs of the Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham, p. 136). It and those of other yakkhas compare favourably with presentations of devas. The Stone Couch is, in the <i>Sutta Nipāta Comy.</i> (i, 301), described as a long slab of rock resting on four upright rocks. Gaya comprised both a town and a landing-stage, and the Couch was at the latter, but not far from the town-gate. Here the Master sat, awaiting his two converts-to-be.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Samaṇa, samaṇaka,</i> the affix 'of appurtenance' here has, as is often the case, a diminutive and contemptuous value.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Fausböll's 'sinful' is misleading. B. says: 'shameful or unpleasant, to be avoided like dirt, fire, or a black snake, not to be acquiesced in by that golden-hued body,' so he 'bent away slightly as when one bends back the golden envelope of a piece of jewelry. Now the yakkha had hairs (<i>loma</i>) over the body like tapestry needles (<i>sūci</i>); these he erected, assuming a horrid shape with wide-opened mouth.' Khara is described as having scales like a crocodile's back. Both cases were results of thefts from 'the Order' in a former birth.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Either by making an appalling sight of himself before the Buddha, or by uttering fearful sounds, etc. <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The verses are in <i>triṣṭhubh</i> metre, interrupted by two <i>ślokas</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The simile is explained by B. as I give it: Boys pass a string round a crow's leg and their finger, and pull it down in its flight; so our evil thoughts springing from ourselves are pulled back again into consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Taṇhā-snehato jātā.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Ito attabhāvato jātā.</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>
