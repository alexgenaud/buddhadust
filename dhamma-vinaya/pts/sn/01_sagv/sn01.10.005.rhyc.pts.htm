					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The story in this little drama-sutta is given briefly in the <i>Comy.</i> on Sānu's <i>gāthā</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.044.rhyc.pts.htm">(<i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> XLIV.),</a> and more fully in the <i>Dhp. Comy.</i> on ver. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.mulr.sbe.htm#v326">326 (iv, 18 f.)</a> and in our <i>Comy.</i> Sānu, whose pious mother had placed him in the Order as a child, leads a model career till he suffers a normal relapse and recrudescence of worldly longing. In distress and dishevelment he visits his mother and confesses his distracted condition. She prepares food to comfort him, but his previous mother, who had been a Yakkha, was now a daughter of the gods and honoured exceedingly by them because of her late son's piety. Anxious not to lose credit and to 'save his soul,' she intervenes and 'possesses' him, so that he falls in an epileptic fit. The mother takes him on her knees, with embraces and lamentation. The ex-mother 'in' the son warns her of her son's parlous state; the son revives and wonders; the mother admonishes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Is this <i>so ahu</i>? The four lines are in Burmese MSS. only, and B. takes no notice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The arahant was just a holy man to the average layman. (<i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/018.twenty.verses.htm#pg130"><i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> 130.</a>) The line seems to resemble a ballad refrain, not always very pertinent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> These 2-1/2 lines occur in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/007.two.verses.htm#pg31"><i>Pss. of the Sisters,</i> p. 31.</a> She now refers to her own piety as meeting, no less than her son's, with unfair reward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> On this power ascribed to Yakkhas, Pisāchas, etc., <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../resources/pdf/hopkins/hopkins-religions_of_india.pdf">Washburn Hopkins's <i>Religions of India,</i> p. 415:</a> — 'Associated with <i>Skanda</i> (the Saivite battle-god) are the spirits, or 'mothers,' who afflict people. ... As in other lands, people are 'possessed' by evil spirits called <i>graha's:</i> seizers (our Pali has <i>gahito</i>, seized). ... The mothers are witches and live in cross-roads, cemeteries, and mountains. They may be of Dravidian origin ...' He refers to several passages in the <i>Anugītā</i> (Mahābhārata).</p>
