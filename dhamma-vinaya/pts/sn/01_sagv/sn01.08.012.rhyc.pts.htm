					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Vaŋgīsa had but a little while ago won Arahantship,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and experiencing the bliss of emancipation,<br />

							From town and village on to town again.<br />
							Then we beheld the All-Enlightened <i>[him<br />
							Who hath transcended all that we can know]</i>.<br />
							He in the Norm instructed me <i>[the Seer<br />
							Who hath transcended all the power of ill.<br />
							And when we heard that Norm our heart was glad],</i><br />
							And faith and trust therein rose up in us.<br />
							Hearing that Norm concerning body, mind,<br />
							Sensations, objects of the same, and all<br />
							The data of our knowledge — learning these<br />
							I left the world to lead the homeless life.</p>

							And seen salvation's system and its way,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The holy seer did win enlightenment ...<br />
							0 welcome wast thou then to me who now,<br />

							<a id="pg249"><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span></a> The greater Triple Veda have I won,<br />
							The training in the Buddha's Rule is done.<br />
							I know as what I lived in times gone by,<br />
							Clear is the vision of the heavenly eye;<br />
							And magic power, the threefold lore is mine,<br />
							And thoughts of others can my thought divine."</p>
