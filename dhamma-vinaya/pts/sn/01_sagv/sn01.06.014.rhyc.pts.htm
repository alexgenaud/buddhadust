					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br />
					and on that occasion the Exalted One addressed the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord!" they made reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In days gone by, bhikkhus,<br />
					I was a king named Aruṇavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this king had a royal residence named Aruṇavatī.</p>

					<p class="f4">And near it<br />
					was staying Sikhin,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant Buddha Supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Sikhin had a pair of disciples,<br />
					chief, elect,<br />
					named Abhibhu<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and Sambhava.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sikhin addressed Abhibhu, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Brahmin, let us go to one of the Brahmā-worlds<br />
					till the time comes for a meal.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied Abhibhu,<br />
					and like as a strong man would stretch forth his bent arm,<br />
					or bend his arm stretched forth,<br />
					so did they twain vanish from Aruṇavatī,<br />
					the king's residence,<br />
					and appear in that Brahmā-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said Sikhin, the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant Buddha Supreme<br />
					to Abhibhu bhikkhu:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let there occur to thee, brahmin,<br />
					a religious discourse<br />
					for this Brahmā and his company<br />
					and his attendants.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied Abhibhu bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he therewith instructed,<br />
					enlightened,<br />
					incited,<br />
					and inspired the Brahmā,<br />
					his company,<br />
					and his attendants<br />
					with a religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">But forsooth the Brahmā,<br />
					his <a id="pg195"><span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span></a> company,<br />
					and his attendants were thereupon offended,<br />
					annoyed,<br />
					irritated,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 but this is a wondrous thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 but this is a strange thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">How shall a disciple<br />
					preach a religion<br />
					in the presence of his Master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sikhin told Abhibhu<br />
					what they were feeling and thinking,<br />
					and added:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wherefore now, do thou, brahmin,<br />
					agitate them exceedingly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied Abhibhu,<br />
					and continued to preach<br />
					now with a visible,<br />
					now with an invisible body,<br />
					now with a body,<br />
					the lower half only of which was visible,<br />
					now with a body,<br />
					the upper half only of which was visible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the hearts of the Brahmā,<br />
					his company,<br />
					and his attendants,<br />
					were filled with wonder and marvel:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 but this is a wondrous thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">0 but this is a marvellous thing: —<br />
					the great magic power and might of the recluse!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And Abhibhu bhikkhu said to Sikhin the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I profess, lord, that using just such speech<br />
					as if I were speaking in the midst of [a gathering of] our Order,<br />
					I am able as I stand in the Brahmā-world<br />
					to make its thousand realms hear my voice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the hour for it, brahmin,<br />
					this is the hour<br />
					in which standing in the Brahmā-world<br />
					thou mayest make its thousand realms hear thy voice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' replied Abhibhu bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">And standing in the Brahmā-world he uttered these verses: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Bestir yourselves, rise up, renounce and come,<br />
							And yield your hearts unto the Buddha's rule.<br />
							Shake off the armies of the king of death<br />
							As doth the elephant a reed-thatched shed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Whoso within this Norm and Discipline,<br />
							Shall ever strenuous and earnest live,<br />
							Rebirth's eternal round put far away,<br />
							All pain and suffering he shall end for aye.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, bhikkhus, Sikhin the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant Buddha Supreme,<br />
					and Abhibhu bhikkhu,<br />
					having agitated the <a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> Brahmā,<br />
					his company<br />
					and his attendants,<br />
					like as a strong man would stretch forth his bent arm,<br />
					or bend his arm stretched forth,<br />
					vanished from that Brahmà-world<br />
					and appeared at Araṇavatī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sikhin the Exalted One addressed the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Did ye hear, bhikkhus,<br />
					the verses uttered by Abhibhu bhikkhu<br />
					whiles he was standing in Brahmā-world?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'We did hear, lord, the verses he so spoke.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'And what, bhikkhus, were the verses that ye heard him utter?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'"Bestir yourselves, rise up, renounce and come,<br />
							And yield your hearts unto the Buddha's rule.<br />
							Shake off the armies of the king of death<br />
							As doth the elephant a reed-thatched shed.<br />
							Whoso within this Norm and Discipline,<br />
							Shall ever strenuous and earnest live,<br />
							Rebirth's eternal round put far away,<br />
							All pain and suffering he shall end for aye."</p>

					<p class="f4">These, lord, were the verses that we heard Abhibhu bhikkhu utter,<br />
					whiles he was standing in Brahmā-world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well done, bhikkhus, well done!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well did ye hear the verses uttered by Abhibhu bhikkhu<br />
					whiles he was standing in Brahmā-world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the gladdened bhikkhus were delighted by the sayings of the Exalted One.</p>
