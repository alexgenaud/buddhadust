					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Uruvelā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					on the banks of the river Nerañjarā,<br />
					beneath the Goatherd's Banyan,<br />
					and he had just attained full enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now as he was privately meditating,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the thought arose in him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have penetrated<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> this Norm,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					deep, hard to perceive, hard to understand,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					peaceful<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and sublime,<br />
					no mere dialectic,<br />
					subtle, intelligible only to the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this is a race devoting itself to the things to which it clings,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					devoted thereto,<br />
					delighting therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">And for a race devoting itself to the things to which it clings,<br />
					devoted thereto,<br />
					delighting therein,<br />
					this were a matter hard to perceive, to wit,<br />
					that this <a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> is conditioned by that —<br />
					that all that happens is by way of cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, were a matter hard to discern, to wit,<br />
					the tranquillization of all the activities of [worldly] life,<br />
					the renunciation of all substrates of rebirth,<br />
					the destruction of natural cravings,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now I only might teach the Norm,<br />
					and others might not acknowledge me:<br />
					this would be wearisome to me,<br />
					this would be hurtful to me."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And then verily to the Exalted One were revealed these verses on the spur of the moment,<br />
					unheard of before: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"This that thro' many toils I've won,<br />
							Enough! Why should I make it known?<br />
							By folk with lust and hate consumed<br />
							Not this a Norm that can be grasped.<br />
							Against the stream [of common thought],<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Deep, subtle, fine, and hard to see,<br />
							Unseen 't will be by passion's slaves,<br />
							Cloaked in the murk [of ignorance]."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise,<br />
					pondering over the matter,<br />
					did the heart of the Exalted One incline to be averse from exertion<br />
					and not towards preaching the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon to Brahmā-Sahampati,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					becoming aware in thought of the thoughts of the Exalted One,<br />
					was this revealed: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Woe, woe! now will the world perish!</p>

					<p class="f4">Woe! now will the world utterly perish,<br />
					in that the heart of the Tathāgata,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					Buddha Supreme<br />
					inclines to be averse from exertion<br />
					and not towards preaching the Norm!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg173"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span></a> Then did Brahmā-Sahampati,<br />
					even like a strong man stretching his bent arm out,<br />
					or drawing together his arm outstretched,<br />
					vanish from the Brahmā world<br />
					and appear before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					and stooping his right knee to the ground,<br />
					raised his joined hands towards the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord! let the Exalted One preach the Norm!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One preach the Norm!</p>

					<p class="f4">There are souls whose eyes are hardly dimmed by dust<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>;<br />
					they are perishing from not hearing the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">They will come to be knowers of the Norm."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thereafter he said this also:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"There hath appeared in Magadha before thee<br />
							A Norm impure by minds unclean contrived.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Unlock this door<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> t' Ambrosia! Let them hearken<br />
							To Norm by Pure and Holy One revived.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">As on a crag on crest of mountain standing<br />
							A man might watch the people far below,<br />
							E'en so do thou, 0 Wisdom fair, ascending,<br />
							0 Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<br />
							Look down, from grief released, upon the nations<br />
							Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Arise, thou Hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br />
							Thou freed from debt! Lord of the Caravan!<br />
							Walk the world o'er, [sublime and blessed Teacher!]<br />
							Teach us the Norm! There are, who'll understand."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					understanding the entreaty of Brahmā,<br />
					because of his pitifulness toward all souls,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					looked down with a Buddha's Eye over the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One saw,<br />
					<a id="pg174"><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span></a> with a Buddha's Eye, so looking,<br />
					souls whose eyes were scarcely dimmed by dust,<br />
					and souls whose eyes were sorely dimmed by dust,<br />
					souls sharp of sense<br />
					and souls blunted of sense,<br />
					souls of good<br />
					and souls of evil disposition,<br />
					souls docile<br />
					and souls indocile,<br />
					some among them living with a perception of the danger of other worlds and of wrongdoing.</p>

					<p class="f4">As in a pool of blue or red or white lotus,<br />
					some lotus plants born in the water,<br />
					emerge not, but grow up and thrive sunken beneath the surface;<br />
					and other lotus plants,<br />
					born in the water and growing up in the water,<br />
					rise to the surface;<br />
					and other lotus plants,<br />
					born in the water and growing up in the water,<br />
					stand thrusting themselves above the water and unwetted by it,<br />
					even so did the Exalted One,<br />
					look down over the world with a Buddha's Eye,<br />
					and see souls whose eyes were scarcely dimmed by dust,<br />
					souls whose eyes were sorely dimmed by dust,<br />
					souls sharp of sense<br />
					and blunted of sense,<br />
					souls of good<br />
					and souls of evil disposition,<br />
					souls docile<br />
					and souls indocile,<br />
					some among them living with a perception of the danger of other worlds and of wrongdoing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing Brahmā Sahampati he made response in verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Open for them the doors stand to Ambrosia!<br />
							Let those that hear renounce the faith they hold.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Foreseeing hurt I have not preached, Brahmā,<br />
							The Norm sublime and excellent for men."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now am I one by whom an opening has been given<br />
					for the preaching of the Norm by the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he bowed down before the Exalted One,<br />
					and passing round him by the right,<br />
					vanished there and then.</p>
