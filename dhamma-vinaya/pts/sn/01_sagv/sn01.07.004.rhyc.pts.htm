Another relation of the Bharadvaja Brahman is outraged at his conversion and confronts the Buddha in silence.

					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p4.1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.07.001-022.pali.bd.htm#p4.1">4.1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>,<br />
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Bhāradvaja brahmin<br />
					[known as] the Congey-man<br />
					heard that the Bhāradvaja had<br />
					"left the world to enter the Order of Gotama the Recluse."</p>

					<p class="f4">Vexed and displeased,<br />
					he sought the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and when there<br />
					sat at one side in silence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, discerning by his mind<br />
					the thoughts of that man's mind,<br />
					addressed him in verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Whoso doth wrong the man that's innocent: —<br />
							Him that is pure and from all errors free —<br />
							His wicked act returns upon that fool<br />
							Like fine dust that is thrown against the wind."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, the Congey-man said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which had been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which was hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who had gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br />
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br />
					shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br />
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br />
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One,<br />
					and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br />
					the venerable Bhāradvāja,<br />
					remaining alone and separate,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent and strenuous,<br />
					attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br />
					for the sake of which the clansmen<br />
					rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br />
					yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br />
					even in this present life,<br />
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand<br />
					that rebirth was destroyed,<br />
					that the holy life was being lived,<br />
					that his task was done,<br />
					that for life as we conceive it<br />
					there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
