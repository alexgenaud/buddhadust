					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Lit. this be-<i>saṇṇā</i>-ed be-<i>mano</i>-ed carcase (<i>kaḷebara,</i>*). The Buddha draws him away from his pre-occupation about the dimensions of the world (this Chakkavāla) and his 'seven-league-boot's' stride, and leaves him to infer that the only way to get past or out of all processes of life was to get release from the ill that goes with life. It was a great opportunity for exegesis, but B. makes no use of it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Read <i>have</i> for <i>bhave</i>. The Pali metre changes here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> B. judges that this Sutta is an opportunity for him, and expatiates on the magnanimous enthusiasm of Ānanda for his beloved comrade, on the epithets he uses in his eulogy, and on the glowing effulgence in the devas' expression of their emotions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> So far the eulogy agrees with that ascribed to the Buddha in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.111.pali.bd.htm"><i>M.</i> iii, 25 f.</a> (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p111">Anupada-Sutta;</a> <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/01_ones/an01.585-654.pali.bd.htm#p637"><i>A.</i> i, 45</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/01_ones/an01.585-654.pali.bd.htm#p637">[I, xxi, 53];</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/05_mv/sn05.55.024.pali.bd.htm#pg376"><i>S.</i> v, 376 f.</a>). B. analyzes each term, here and in the other Commentaries. For the content of 'wisdom' he refers to <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.115.pali.bd.htm#pg62"><i>M.</i> iii, 62 f.</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p115">(Bahudhātuka-Sutta):</a> 'proficient knowledge of elements, of sense-processes, of cause and effect, and of possibles and impossibles' in the cosmic order.

'Swift': 'who quickly cognizes, understands.' On the double meaning of <i>*javana</i>, see <i>Compendium,</i> 245 f. 'Sharp' implies swift elimination, intolerance of vicious consciousness, volcanic attainment 'at one sitting.' Here the Vedanāpariggaha-Sutta <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p74">(<i>sic</i>: <i>M.</i> i, No. 74)</a> is instanced. <i>Cf,</i> <i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> pp. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.259.rhyc.pts.htm#pg342">342,</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.259.rhyc.pts.htm#pg345">345.</a> 'Fastidious' involves the exegetical double use of <i>nibbedhika:</i> he is pierced by emotion and disgust at the World, and he pierces and shatters greed, hate, ignorance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>Vattā</i> is speaker, but the <i>Comy.</i> adds the implication of <i>odhunana,</i> stirring, and of undelaying exhortation. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.259.rhyc.pts.htm#v994">Pss. of the Brethren, v. 994.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> There is a word-play in this line and the last of the preceding stanza ābhato (praise-<i>borne</i>) and bhatiko (<i>bearer,</i> carrier, wage-earner). The concluding line is amplified in Sāriputta's own verses <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.259.rhyc.pts.htm#v1003">(<i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> 1002, 1003),</a> quoted by B.: —</p>
