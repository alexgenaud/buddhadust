					<p class="f4">On one occasion, at Sāvatthi,<br />
					a certain brahmin millionaire,<br />
					looking worn and in a coarse cloak,<br />
					came to visit the Exalted One and,<br />
					exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of courtesy,<br />
					took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore, brahmin, art thou looking worn<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and art clad in a coarse cloak?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> "Four sons have I, Master Gotama,<br />
					in this place and they,<br />
					in concert with their wives,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					have shown me the door."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, brahmin, thou shouldst learn these verses and,<br />
					when the folk are assembled in the Chapter Hall,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and thy sons seated there also,<br />
					recite them: —</p>

					      <p class="fp4 in2">'They at whose birth my heart was glad,<br />
							For whose becoming much I longed,<br />
							They now in concert with their wives<br />
							Are as a dog that drives off swine.<br />

							Who call me 'dear one,' call me 'dad'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Demons are they in guise of sons.<br />
							Him that is come to years they leave<br />

							<a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> And by the stick's effective power<br />

					<p class="f4">Then that brahmin, when he had learned the verses<br />
					taught him by the Exalted One,<br />
					recited them to all the folk assembled in the Chapter Hall,<br />
					his sons being seated there also.</p>

					      <p class="fp4 in2">"They at whose birth my heart was glad,<br />

					<p class="f4">There - after his sons led that brahmin to his house,<br />
					and when they had bathed him,<br />
					they each clothed him<br />
					with a suit of raiment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that brahmin, taking one of the suits,<br />
					went to visit the Exalted One and,<br />
					exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of courtesy,<br />
					took his seat at one side,<br />
					and so seated, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We brahmins, Master Gotama, select a teacher's fee for our teacher.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama be pleased to accept my fee."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One. moved by compassion, accepted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br />
					that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed<br />
					that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way<br />
					to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways<br />
					made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> A <i>mahdsāla</i> is a magnate either brahmin or noble, but emphatically a wealthy person. This man's fortune amounted to 800,000 (? coins) stored in his house. The legend told is that he presented each son on his marriage with an eighth. They fearing lest he, being a widower, would remarry, petted and coddled him, but told him that to carry this on, they would need each the remaining four-eights. He gave all, retaining only his clothing, and lived with his eldest son. Soon the daughter-in-law had him barred out; the others followed suit. He entered the brahmin order of Pandarangas and suffered great privations, till he throws himself on the reputed kindness and graciousness of the Samana Gotama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Lūkha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Sampuccha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The meeting of the brahmin synod, parallel to the santhāgāra or <i>Khattiya</i> (nobles') mote hall. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm#fn26"><i>Dialogues,</i> i, 113, n. 2.</a> B. amplifies the meagre account. Neglect of parents was punishable by death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The sons fall at the father's feet, who withdraws his charge and bids them support him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Tāta, tāta:</i> the gèneral familiar masculine appellative. We have nothing quite similar.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Daṇḍa</i> is here, I think, used in its double sense of recluse's staff, and legal punishment. The fact that he had arraigned his sons before the citizens in the hope of gaining redress gives point, lacking otherwise to these lines. 'He goes on to show his bettered condition,' is B.'s meagre comment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The metaphors are so elliptically expressed that they seem mixed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'I was in the dark; the <i>daṇḍa</i> guides me; I was in deep water; it steadies me, etc.'</p>
