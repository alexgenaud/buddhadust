					<p class="f4">On one occasion at Sāvatthi<br />
					a brahmin who supported his mother<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					came to see the Exalted One, and,<br />
					exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of courtesy,<br />
					took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth, Master Gotama,<br />
					I seek my alms after the normal manner,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and so seeking them I maintain my parents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I not, sir, in so doing,<br />
					doing what ought to be done?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, verily thou, brahmin,<br />
					in so doing<br />
					doest what ought to be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, brahmin, seeks alms after the normal manner,<br />
					and so seeking maintains his parents,<br />
					engenders much merit.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">In normal fashion whoso doth maintain<br />
							His mother or his father, in this life<br />
							Him for that cherishing the wise commend,<br />
							And after death he wins the joys of heaven."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been spoken<br />
					the mother-maintaining
					brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Most excellent, Master Gotama,<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br />
					that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed<br />
					that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way<br />
					to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways<br />
					made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! I go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer me as a lay-adherent,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> It was permissible, by the laws compiled in 'Manu,' for a brahmin to live by food given unasked or got by begging (IV, 4, 5), especially in times of scarcity (X, 120). Hence neither this brahmin, nor the mendicant <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.07.020.rhyc.pts.htm">(§ 10),</a> was necessarily a recluse.</p>
