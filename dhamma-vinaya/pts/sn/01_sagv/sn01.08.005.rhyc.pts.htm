					<p class="f4">On one occasion, when he was staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at the Jeta Vana,<br />
					the Exalted One addressed the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, lord," they said responsive.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessed of four qualities, Bhikkhus,<br />
					is the speech that is well<br />
					and not ill spoken,<br />
					faultless<br />
					and not blamable by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg240"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span></a> Of what four qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Bhikkhus, if a brother speak well<br />
					and not badly,<br />
					speak righteously<br />
					and not unrighteously,<br />
					speak affectionately<br />
					and not unkindly,<br />
					speak truth<br />
					and not falsehood,<br />
					his speech having these four qualities,<br />
					is well spoken,<br />
					faultless,<br />
					and not blamable by the wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and the Blessed One saying this,<br />
					the Master spake thus further: —</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"The good say: first let speech be nicely said,<br />
							And second, speak by good norm, not by bad,<br />
							Next, ye should kindly, not unkindly speak,<br />
							And fourthly, say ye what is true, not false."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaŋgīsa,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					and draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					stretched forth his hands<br />
					saluting, to the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is revealed to me, Exalted One,<br />
					it is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it revealed to thee, Vaŋgīsa!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vaŋgīsa extolled the Exalted One in his presence<br />
					in suitable verses: —</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Whoso can speak a word whereby he works<br />
							No torment to himself, nor causeth harm<br />
							To fellow-men, that word is spoken well.<br />
							Whoso can speak a kindly word, a word<br />
							That's grateful to the ear, and lays not hold<br />
							Of other's faults, that word is kindly spoke.<br />
							Truth is ambrosial speech<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>; of saints of old<br />
							This was the ancient Norm<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>; on Truth and good<br />
							And Norm, 't is said, the saints do firmly stand.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The Word which the Awakened speaketh, sure<br />
							Safe guide to make Nibbāna ours, to put<br />
							An end to Ill: — that is the Word Supreme."</p>
