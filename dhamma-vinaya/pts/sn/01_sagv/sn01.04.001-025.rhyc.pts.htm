Festival-cakes were also handed about, and Māra foreseeing much offering of these to the Buddha, and much profit accruing to the '500 maidens' at the sports, should he discourse, thwarted this.

It is a subtle touch, in this delightful legend, that, to be able to discern a transmission, from body to germ, of that which was not a substance, material or immaterial, but a resultant of forces, Māra, fertile in shape-transformation, should sublimate himself into vapour. Is it possibly associated with <i>ātman</i> (<i>pneuma</i>) myths?</p>
