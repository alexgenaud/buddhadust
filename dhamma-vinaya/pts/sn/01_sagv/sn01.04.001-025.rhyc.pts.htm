Clansmen's daughters, arrayed in their best, held a parade, the youths having also foregathered, and presents, or at least flowers, were presented. Festival-cakes were also handed about, and Māra foreseeing much offering of these to the Buddha, and much profit accruing to the '500 maidens' at the sports, should he discourse, thwarted this. The Buddha, adds B., could have foreseen the fruitlessness of his quest, had it not been unbecoming for a Buddha to have considered beforehand the chances of his obtaining food on a given round.</p>

The point lies in the antithesis between the irruption of the cares of this life — the result of worldly desires, possessions, ownership — and the calm and supramundane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibbāna the extinction of all such cares and desires. Māra's exordium had failed before it was uttered. The Buddha had no eyes for things owned, else Māra had retained some hold on him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> Windisch's rendering of <i>khandha</i> not by shoulder but by 'aggregate,' is strained.

The reason (<i>kāraṇa</i>) or conditions for its becoming reinstated in a new embryo were, in Godhika's case, absent.' It is a subtle touch, in this delightful legend, that, to be able to discern a transmission, from body to germ, of that which was not a substance, material or immaterial, but a resultant of forces, Māra, fertile in shape-transformation, should sublimate himself into vapour. Is it possibly associated with <i>ātman</i> (<i>pneuma</i>) myths?</p>

The <i>Comy.</i>., with Feer, reads <i>vittaŋ</i>: property, money, and explains: <i>vittaŋ nu jinno</i> (sic)? (<i>jino iti katthaci</i>) <i>sataŋ vā sahassaŋ vā jito si nu?</i> Are you beaten [to the tune of] a hundred or a thousand [coins]? At the repetition there is no further comment.
