					<p class="f4">When The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Bhāradvāja [known as] Tangles,<br />
					went to visit the Exalted One and,<br />
					exchanging with him the compliments of amity and courtesy,<br />
					took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he addressed the Exalted One in a verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Tangle within, without, lo! in the toils<br />
							Entangled is the race of sentient things.<br />
							Hence would I ask thee, Gotama, of this:<br />
							Who is't can from this tangle disembroil?"</p>

							<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"The man discreet, on virtue planted firm,<br />
					      In intellect and intuition trained;<br />
					      The brother ardent and discriminant:<br />
					      'Tis he may from this tangle disembroil.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They  that have lust and hate and nescience spurned,<br />
					      The Arahants immune from deadly Drugs,<br />
					      For them the tangle all unravelled lies.<br />
					      Where mind and body wholly cease to be,<br />
					      And earthly sense and sense celestial: —<br />
					      Here is the tangle riven utterly."</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, Tangles, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which had been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which was hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who had gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those who had eyes could see external objects<br />
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord, betake myself<br />
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br />
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world under the Exalted One, and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br />
					the venerable Bhāradvāja, remaining alone and separate,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent and strenuous,<br />
					attained [ere long] to that supreme goal of the higher life,<br />
					for the sake of which the clansmen<br />
					rightly go forth from home into the homeless;<br />
					yea, that supreme goal did he by himself,<br />
					even in this present life,<br />
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand that<br />
					rebirth was destroyed,<br />
					that the holy life was being lived,<br />
					that his task was done,<br />
					that for life as we conceive it<br />
					there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the Arahants.</p>
