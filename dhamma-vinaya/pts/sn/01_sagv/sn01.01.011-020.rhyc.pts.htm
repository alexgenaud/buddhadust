					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Samiddhi as the dawn drew near arose and went to the Hot Springs to bathe. And after his bath, he came out of the Hot Springs and stood clad in a single garment, drying his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain deva, when the night was far spent, illuminating all the Hot-Spring lake with her effulgent beauty, came up to the venerable Samiddhi and, floating in the air, uttered these verses:—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> "Ne'er having had thy fill thou seekest alms,<br />
					      O almsman; yea, nor taking now thy fill<br />
					      Thou seekest alms. O almsman, take thy fill<br />
					      Then seek thine alms. Let not the hour slip by!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">[<i>Samiddhi:</i> —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Naught of thine 'hour' know I. Mine hour is hid,<br />
					      Not manifest. Therefore I seek mine alms<br />
					      Not taking first my fill, lest the hour pass me by."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that fairy took her stand on the earth and spoke to Samiddhi thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Thou are young, bhikkhu, to have left the world, and callow, black-haired and blessed with the luck of youth; thou hast not in thine early prime had the fun that belongs to natural desires. Take thy fill, bhikkhu, of human leasures. Give not up the things of the present to pursue that which involves time."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, have not given up the things of the present to pursue that which involves time. Nay, I have given up that which involves time to pursue the things of the present. Things involving time, friend, as the Exalted One hath said, are the pleasures of the sense, full of ill, full of anxiety; that way lies abundant disaster. A thing of the present is this Norm, not involving time, inviting to come and see, leading onward, to be regarded by the wise as a personal experience."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg16"><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></a> "In what way, bhikkhu, hath the Exalted One pronounced the pleasures of the sense to involve time, to be full of ill, full of anxiety, conducive to abundant disaster? In what way is this Norm a thing of the present, not involving time, inviting to come and see, leading onward, to be regarded by the wise as a personal experience?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, am a novice;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> I have but lately left the world, and am newly admitted. I am not able to explain the Norm and Rule in detail. But the Exalted One, who is Arahant, fully enlightened, he is staying at Rājagaha in the Tapodā Park. Go to that Exalted One and ask him of this matter. Bear in mind that wherewith he shall answer you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not easy is it, bhikkhu, for us to approach the Exalted One, so is he surrounded by other and mighty devas. If thou, bhikkhu, wilt approach the Exalted One and ask him of this matter, we too may come to hear the doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friend," responded the venerable Samiddhi. And he went to the Exalted One, saluted him with obeisance, and sat down on one side. So seated, he spake to the Exalted One, telling him of the fairy's interview after his bathe in the Tapodā, and of his reply, and of the fairy's further questioning, and of her fear of not gaining access. "If, lord, that fairy spoke truly, she is just here, not far from us."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had so said, that fairy said to the venerable Samiddhi:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Ask, bhikkhu! Ask, bhikkhu, for I have won through!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the fairy in verses:—</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Buddha rebukes the fairy for her suggestive ambiguities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The burden of the verses is doctrinally and philosophically of high importance, and the bewilderment of the frivolous fairy, abruptly confronted with them, is ironically pathetic. 'Told by names,' lit., 'what may be expressed' (<i>akkheyyāni,</i> from <i>ā-khā</i>, to pro-claim); <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#pg4"><i>D.</i> i, 4;</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v275"><i>Dhammapada,</i> 275;</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.015.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> ii, 17,</a> etc. Mankind, says B., have many notions (<i>saññino</i> — are 'ware of) about the many compounds of the five aggregates (<i>i.e.,</i> of mind and matter), expressed in names, <i>e.g.</i> god, man, layman, recluse, person, individual, Tissa, Phussa, etc. He who understands sees in these compounds as such no realities, nor a permanent entity in the declarer of them. The only realities are the several components (the five khandhas), and these, though real, are ever changing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> These are the three forms of false opinion and strife springing from <i>māna.</i> See above <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.001-010.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.1.9">I, 1, § 9;</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.049.pali.bd.htm"><i>S</i>. iii, 48;</a> <i>Bud.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> <i>Sankhā.</i> The arahant has put away such notions as 'lusting,' 'being angry,' 'confused.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> reads <i>na ca mānam ajjhagā,</i> and it is very likely, since this agrees with the context, that Feer read <i>vi-</i> erroneously if he consulted here only Singhalese MSS. Nevertheless B. allows the alternative sense, in <i>mānan</i> of an abode, <i>i.e.,</i> in rebirth, a matrix, <i>as if</i> he had a <i>v.l. = vimānaŋ</i> before him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> The fairy has rightly discerned, says B., the Middle Path between self-indulgence and self-torture. In fact she gives the whole Eightfuld Path: — 'in speech, or body': Angas 305; 'mindful': Angas 6-8; 'understanding': Angas 1,2. 'It was in fact the occasion of a mighty teaching.'</p>
