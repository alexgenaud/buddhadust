					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying
					among the Sākyans<br />
					at a Sākyan township named Khomadussa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at an early hour<br />
					the Exalted One dressed himself and,<br />
					taking bowl and robe,<br />
					entered the township of Khomadussa for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just then the brahmin householders of the place<br />
					were assembled in their place of council<br />
					to transact some matters,<br />
					and the god was raining drop by drop.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One came up to the hall,<br />
					and they saw him coming from afar.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seeing him, they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who now are these shaveling friar-men?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what can they know about council rules?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the brahmin house-fathers of Khomadussa in the verse: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"No 'council' that where are no pious gentlemen,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Nor gentle they whose speech observes no rule.<br />
							They who have put far from them lust and enmity<br />
							And dullness, they become good gentlemen.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was spoken,<br />
					the Khomadussa brahmin housefathers said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, Master Gotama, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one raised up<br />
					that which had been overthrown,<br />
					or revealed<br />
					that which had been hidden,<br />
					or declared the way<br />
					to one who was bewildered,<br />
					or carried an oil-lamp into the dark,<br />
					so that they that had eyes could see,<br />
					even so is the Norm in many ways made manifest by Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lo! We go for refuge to Gotama the Exalted One,<br />
					to the Norm,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama suffer us as a lay-adherents,<br />
					who from this day forth<br />
					as long as life endures<br />
					has taken in him refuge!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Meaning 'linen cloth'; 'because of the preponderance (<i>usmnnattā</i>) of such,' says B.; but whether as made there, or worn, or both, does not appear. I can find no other reference to the place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Lit. 'hall-rule' (<i>sabhā-dhamma</i>). According to B., there was a side-entrance to avoid disturbing those who were comfortably seated, but the Buddha, aware that he would be creating or suffering discomfort, walked 'straight' in (<i>ujukam eva āgacchati</i>), angering the audience. He had previously 'willed the rain to fall.' The reason is not given, unless it served as an excuse for taking shelter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Santo:</i> 'wise, good men.' <i>Comy.</i></p>
