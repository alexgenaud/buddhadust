					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Āḷavi [and had entered] the haunt of a yakkha of Āḷavi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that yakkha said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Get out, friar!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, friend,'<br />
					said the Exalted One, and came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come in, friar!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, friend,'<br />
					said the Exalted One, and came in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did the yakkha order the Exalted One a second,<br />
					and yet a third time,<br />
					and the Exalted One complied each time.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet a fourth time the Āḷavan yakkha said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, friend, I will not come out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do what thou hast to do.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will ask thee, friar, a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">If thou wilt not answer,<br />
					I will either derange thy mind,<br />
					or split thy heart,<br />
					or take thee by the feet<br />
					and throw thee over the Ganges.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'1 see no one, friend, in the whole world,<br />
					be he Māra or Brahmā,<br />
					be he god or man,<br />
					be he brahmin or recluse,<br />
					who is able to do any one of these things to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless ask thou according to thy desire.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The story of this little episode is given with great amplitude and in many identical words by both our <i>Comy.</i> and that on the <i>Sutta Nipāta,</i> where the Sutta also occurs (I, 10). Three salient features at least link it to the large group of stories grouped so ably by Dr. Watanabe under the name of Kalmāsapāda stories (<a href="../../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1909_vi.pdf#page=235"><i>JPTS.</i>, 1909-10, p. 240 f.</a>): — (1) The man-eating yakkha, (2) the captured King saving himself by a promise, and the sanctity of that promise. (3) The conversion of the man-eater. When the Sutta begins, the yakkha is represented as returning home and finding the Teacher seated in his dwelling and exhorting a respectful group of his women folk 'as if he were master of the house.' The Buddha has sought permission to enter, with the intention of converting the yakkha. With a heart full of amity, he judges the best way is to soften the yakkha by compliance. The yakkha, expecting a night's wrestling with the supernormal powers of a Rishi, is dazed, and tries that compliance, thinking eventually to tire him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> That the questions and answers had been handed down by the yakkha's parents (who had them from Kassapa Buddha), written on
					and	gold leaf (<i>pappe</i>) in red ink, are a quaint feature in the legend.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Mittāni,</i> the neuter plural. Perhaps 'kind acts' are meant. See I, 6, § 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Vicakkhaṇo.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Khanti</i> replaces <i>dhiti</i>. The preceding term, <i>cāga,</i> is in Pali unchanged.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Attho aamparāyiko.</i> 'Growth and good' just below is also <i>attho.</i> B. gives six meanings of <i>*attha,</i> and explains 'causes,' and 'growth and good' thus: — 'causes': <i>karaṇass' etaɱ adhivacanaɱ:</i> 'growth and good': <i>hitāya vuddhiyā ca.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Dhammassa sudhammatā, lit. the fine normality of the Norm: 'So well proclaimed by the Buddha' is all that the Commentaries see in this striking phrase, often occurring in the <i>Pss. of the Brethren.</i></p>
