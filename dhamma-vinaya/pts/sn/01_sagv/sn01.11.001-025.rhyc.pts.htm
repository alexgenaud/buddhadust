					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br />

					<p class="f4">'If in you, dear sirs,<br />

					<p class="f4">And why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br />

					is timid,<br />
					given to panic,<br />
					to fright,<br />

					<p class="f4">If in you<br />
					when ye have gone into forests,<br />
					to the roots of trees,<br />
					to empty places,<br />
					fear and panic and creeping of the flesh should arise,<br />
					do ye in that hour only call me to mind and think:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This, that is the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					supremely enlightened,<br />
					proficient in knowledge and in conduct,<br />
					the Blessed One,<br />

					the Master,<br />
					the Buddha for gods and men,<br />

					<p class="f4">For if ye so call me to mind, bhikkhus,<br />
					any fear,<br />
					panic,<br />
					creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br />
					will be overcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if ye cannot call me to mind,<br />
					call to mind the Norm, and think:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm,<br />
					relating to the present,<br />
					immediate in its results,<br />
					inviting all,<br />
					giving gidance,<br />
					appealing to each,<br />

					<p class="f4">For if ye so call the Norm to mind<br />
					your fear,<br />
					panic,<br />
					creeping of the flesh that will have arisen<br />

					<p class="f4">And if ye cannot call the Norm to mind,<br />
					then call to mind the Order, and think:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Well practised is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples,<br />

					<p class="f4">For if ye so call the Order to mind,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> And why is this?</p>

					Supremely Enlightened,<br />

					hate,<br />
					ignorance,<br />
					is without timidity<br />
					or panic<br />
					or fright,<br />
					and fleeth not."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whene'er in forest or in leafy shade<br />

					      Call to your mind, bhikkhus, th'Enlightened One;<br />
					      No fear, no sense of peril will ye know.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Or if ye cannot on the Buddha think —<br />
					      The chief, the senior of the world, the Bull of men —<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					      Then call the Norm to mind, the well-taught guide.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Or if ye cannot think upon the Norm —<br />
					      The well-taught doctrine wherein guidance lies —<br />
					      Then turn your thoughts to the Fraternity,<br />
					      Unrivalled field where men may sow good deeds.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If ye in Buddha, Order, Norm thus refuge take,<br />
					      Fear, panic, creeping of the flesh will never rise.</p>

Sineru, or Meru) as its King. Other versions are given in the Kulāvaka Jātaka (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.1/jat.1.031.chlm.pts.htm">No. 31</a>) and in the Mahāli-pañha story of the <i>Comy.</i> on <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v30"><i>Dhp.</i> ver. 30</a> (i, 263 <i>f.</i>).

We may presume that, for Buddhists, the thrones and powers of the 33 were relative permanencies, like the Sakkatta (Sakka-hood) of Sakka, occupied successively by long-lived devas. B.'s version of the Asura wars is, that certain devas tried to get the vigorous and virtuous new rulers into their power by doping them with <i>gaṇḍapāna.</i> Sakka warned his comrades to abstain; the plotters alone got dead drunk and were thrown down Sineru. They formed a kingdom below, and lived <i>a-sura,</i> without strong drink, trying from time to time to regain the lost Paradise.</p>

Sakka, B. says, had already conferred <i>(mantetvā)</i> with the Rishis, and the Asuras, wrathful lest this meant an enlisting of Rishis' magic powers, had on one occasion smashed up their hermitage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> And this, writes B. graphically amplifying the slender narrative of Sambara's nightmares, is how, his mind getting deranged <i>(vipati-citto),</i> he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve). <i>Cf.</i> below, <a href="#sn.1.11.23">3, §3.</a> That Rishis, armed with  their weapon of effective cursing, should seek protection seems incongruous, but it is a common trait in the European fairy-story for the witch, etc., to crave a boon.</p>

It was 'up' to B. to discuss the correction of Sakka's version by the 'higher criticism' of the Brahmā, but he passes it by.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> B. is silent over this not very obvious clause. But I think Feer is right and Warren wrong: 'And ne'er proclaim my virtue's fame' <i>(dhammāni).</i> This neuter plural is not unknown, but the proclaiming is precisely what the dear good god was doing! I read <i>dhammā</i> as equivalent to the instrumental <i>dhammena.</i> And <i>nikittaye,</i> 'I may not be false, or inconsistent to,' is good Sanskrit, though not yet found in Pali. Sakka's <i>dhamma</i> (norm or creed) was especially Forbearance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> See above, <a href="#sn.1.11.10">1, §10.</a> 'Through the Rishis' curse.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> <i>Sambari(yā) māyā.</i> Juggling, or ? white magic is all that <i>māyā</i> ever means in early buddhist literature of in Theravāda literature. <i>Asura-vidyā</i> is used in the <i>.Srauta Sūtras</i> as a synonym for <i>māyā.</i> See Vedic Index, Macdonell and Keith, s.v.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> Here is apparently a curious anomaly in B.'s comments. (1) He has told us that Vepacitti's real name was Sambara, Inda, or ruler of the Asuras <a href="#sn.1.11.10">(1, §10).</a> (2) He calls the magician or conjurer whose art is known to Vepacitti, or is Vepacitti's, and who practised it, with direful results, Sambaro Asurindo. (3) He explains the last line as 'Sambara ruler of Asuras, a juggler, who, having practised <i>māyā (māyāvī māyaŋ payojetvā)</i> is "roasting" since a century ago in purgatory:' — and all without making any distinction between any two Sambaras. The only inference is that there was a post of Sambaratta (Sambarahood) as there was of Sakkatta (Sakka-hood), and that the 'late' ruler of the Asuras had an art which was either an heirloom taught to, or an innate talent possessed by each succeeding Sambara. But what an opportunity for our good B. to have missed!<br />
					The Asuras naturally fear to put more power into Sakka's hands: — 'he will torment us, destroy us!' Vepacitti advises him and his, as honest men <i>(tumhe dhammikā va),</i> to keep clear of it <i>(alaŋ vo na māyāya).</i> The legend adds that Sakka's other offer of healing was to take Vepacitti to beg pardon of the Rishis. But to the champion of 'frightfulness' this was too much.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> 'Non-anger is love (or amity) at its inception <i>(pubbabhāgo),</i> non-cruelty is compassion in its inception and after.' <i>Comy.</i></p>
