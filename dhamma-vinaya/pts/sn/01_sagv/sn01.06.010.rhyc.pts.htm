					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p10.1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.06.001-015.pali.bd.htm#p10.1">10.1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD:</b></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On this occasion the Kokālikan bhikkhu<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					coming into the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him and took his seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so seated said thus <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wicked, lord, in their desires<br />
					are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">They are ruled by wicked desires!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the Kokālikan bhikkhu:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Kokālikan,<br />
					say not so!</p>

					<p class="f4">Put thy heart's trust<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in Sāriputta and Moggallāna!.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lovely<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!"</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Kokālikan bhikkhu spoke a second time thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even though, lord, the Exalted One be trustworthy<br />
					and his word reliable,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					yet wicked, I say, in their desires<br />
					are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!,<br />
					and ruled by wicked desires!"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One spoke a second time thus<br />
					to the Kokālikan bhikkhu:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan,<br />
					say not so!</p>

					<p class="f4">Put thy heart's trust<br />
					in Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lovely are Sāriputta and Moggallāna!"</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Kokālikan bhikkhu spoke the same words yet once again,<br />
					and the Exalted One answered him in the same words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Kokālikan bhikkhu,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by the right<br />
					and departed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And soon after,<br />
					the Kokālikan's entire frame<br />
					was covered with pustules<br />
					like mustard seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the size of mustard seed<br />
					they increased to that of small beans,<br />
					to that of chick-peas,<br />
					to that of kolaṭṭhi's,<br />
					to that of jujube-fruit,<br />
					<a id="pg190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span></a> to that of myrobalan,<br />
					to that of unripe vilva fruit,<br />
					to that of billa fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon they broke<br />
					and discharged pus and blood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Kokalikan bhikkhu died of that disease,<br />
					and being dead<br />
					he was reborn in the White Lotus Purgatory<br />
					for that he had hardened his heart<br />
					against Sāriputta and Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					when the night was far spent,<br />
					shedding radiance with his effulgent beauty<br />
					over the entire Jeta Grove,<br />
					drew near to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting, stood at one side and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Kokālikan bhikkhu, lord, is dead,<br />
					and being dead<br />
					he is reborn in the White Lotus Purgatory,<br />
					for that he did harden his heart<br />
					against Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">And having so said,<br />
					Brahmā saluted,<br />
					and passing round to left,<br />
					vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					when the night had passed,<br />
					addressed the brethren,<br />
					telling them of the visit of Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					and of what he had announced.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken,<br />
					a certain brother asked the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How long, lord, is the measure of life<br />
					in the White Lotus Purgatory?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long indeed, bhikkhu, is the measure of life<br />
					in the White Lotus Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not easy is it to reckon<br />
					how many years,<br />
					or centuries,<br />
					or tens or thousands of centuries."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can we reckon it by means of a figure, lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We can, bhikkhu," said the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose there were a load of twenty kharis<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					as we reckon them here in Kosala,<br />
					of sesamum seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose at the end of every century<br />
					a man were to take out one seed at a time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sooner, bhikkhu, would that same load<br />
					be used up and finished<br />
					than [a term in] the Abbuda Purgatory.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now one term in the Nirabbuda Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in Abbuda Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">one term <a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> in Ababa Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in Nirabbuda Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">one term in Aṭaṭa Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in Ababa Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">one term in Ahaha Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in Aṭaṭa Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">one term in Water-lily Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in Ahaha Purgatory;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">one term in the Sogandhika Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in the Water-lily Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">one term in the Blue Lotus Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in the Sogandhika Purgatory;</p>

					<p class="f4">one term in the White Lotus Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in the Blue Lotus Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">And one term in Red Lotus Purgatory<br />
					is equal to twenty in White Lotus Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it is in White Lotus Purgatory, bhikkhu,<br />
					that the Kokālikan bhikkhu has been reborn,<br />
					for that he hardened his heart against Sāriputta and Moggallāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thereupon the Blessed Master spake thus: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"In sooth to every man that's born<br />
							A hatchet grows within his mouth,<br />
							Wherewith the fool, whene'er he speaks<br />
							And speaks amiss, doth cut himself.<br />
							He who the blameworthy doth praise.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Or who the praiseworthy doth blame,<br />
							Builds by his mouth his evil doom,<br />
							And by that doom he finds no weal.<br />
							Trifling the evil luck of one<br />
							Who by the dice doth lose his wealth.<br />
							But greater far his evil luck,<br />
							Taking his all and eke himself,<br />
							Who 'gainst the Blessed Saints on earth<br />
							Doth set his heart at enmity.<br />
							For vaster epochs doth he go —<br />
							A hundred thousand years and eke <br />
							Thirty and six, and yet five more —<br />
							To life in purgatory, who,<br />
							In thought and word on wrong intent,<br />
							Utters abuse of Ariyans."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This popular story is also told in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/kd/snp/kd.snp.faus.sbe.htm#III.10"><i>Sn.</i>: — Kokāliya sutta, Mahāvagga, 10,</a> in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/10_tens/an10.089.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> v, 170,</a> and in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.481.rous.pts.htm"><i>Jāt</i>. iv, No. 481</a>, as the Takkariya Jātaka. B. states that the Kokālikan bhikkhu was a native of a kingdom and city called Kokālī, and the son of a setthi (leading citizen) also so-called! Also that he was <i>not</i> the pupil of Devadatta (see <i>Vin. Texts,</i> iii, 251), but was known as Culla-Kokālika, to distinguish him from Maha-Kokāllka, the former, who was of the brahmin class. He then gives a concise account of the Kokālikan's grievance, more fully told in the <i>Jātaka</i> <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>I.e. mā āhā, evaɱ. Comy.: mā evaɱ abhani.</i> Fausböll <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/kd/snp/kd.snp.faus.sbe.htm#III.10">(<i>SBE</i>. X, p. 118)</a> evidently read: <i>mā hi evaɱ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> 'Charity,' in the <i>Jātaka</i> translation is scarcely correct. The verb <i>pa-sad</i> is constantly used to express 'faith, trust, confidence in.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Pesalā,</i> not 'amiable' (Fausböll, <i>op. cit.</i>), but 'sweetly virtuous' (<i>piya-sīlā</i>). <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> So our text and <i>Comy.</i> The <i>Jātaka</i> <i>Comy.</i> has: 'Thou, Lord, believest in thy chief disciples.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> 'Why? Through the mighty power of Karma. When once Karma gets "room," no one can thrust it off. It gave him no longer there to remain.' <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> According to the <i>Comy.</i>, the Kosalan measure, from a <i>pattha</i> upwards, were four times the bulk of those used in Magadha.
