His life-work unfinished, he is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-Three Gods, leaning against a doorpost there. Accosted as their lord by nymphs with song and music, he believed himself still a bhikkhu, till they brought a cheval-glass (lit. a 'whole-body-ish mirror') and revealed the god-like figure. Bitterly disappointed at his earthly failure, he went, escorted by celestial attendants, to report himself to the Master, de- preciating celestial delights in his verse.

The orthodox view is that merit grows less by utility of the gift, than by the benevolent thought and wish of the donor before, during, and after the giving. If he 'sends such a disposition after' his gift, his merit grows.</p>
