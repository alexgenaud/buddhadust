					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>,<br />
					in the Bamboo Grove,<br />
					at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Asurinda Bhāradvaja<br />
					heard that the Bhāradvaja had<br />
					'left the world to enter the Order of Gotama the Recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Vexed and displeased,<br />
					he sought the presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					and there reviled and abused the Exalted One<br />
					with rude and harsh words.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br />
					the Exalted One remained silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Asurinda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thou art conquered, recluse,<br />
					thou art conquered!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Exalted One: —]</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The fool forsooth doth deem the victory his<br />
							In that he plays the bully with rude speech.<br />
							To him who knoweth how he may forbear,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							This in itself doth make him conqueror.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Worse of the two is he who, when reviled,<br />
							Reviles again. Who doth not, when reviled,<br />
							Revile again, a two-fold victory wins.<br />
							Both of the other and himself he seeks<br />
							The good; for he the other's angry mood<br />
							Doth understand and groweth calm and still.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He who of both is a physician, since<br />
							Himself he healeth and the other too,—<br />
							Folk deem him fool, they knowing not the Norm."</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had so said,<br />
					Asurinda of the Bhāradvājas spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord,<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which had been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which was hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who had gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those who had eyes<br />
					could see external objects<br />
					— even so, lord, has the lord Gotama<br />
					shown me his doctrine in various ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I even I, lord,<br />
					betake myself to the Exalted One<br />
					as my refuge,<br />
					to the Norm<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would leave the world<br />
					under [the Rule of] Gotama;<br />
					I would take orders."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja brahmin left the world<br />
					under the Exalted One,<br />
					and was ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his ordination<br />
					the venerable Bhāradvāja, remaining alone and separate,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent and strenuous,<br />
					attained to that supreme goal<br />
					of the higher life,<br />
					for the sake of which<br />
					the clansmen rightly go forth from home<br />
					into the homeless;<br />
					yea, that supreme goal did he<br />
					by himself,<br />
					even in this present life,<br />
					come to understand and realize.</p>

					<p class="f4">He came to understand<br />
					that rebirth was destroyed,<br />
					that the holy life was being lived,<br />
					that his task was done,<br />
					that for life as we conceive it<br />
					there was no hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Bhāradvāja<br />
					became one of the Arahants.</p>
