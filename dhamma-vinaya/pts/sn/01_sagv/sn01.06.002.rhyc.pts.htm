					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Uruvelā,<br />
					on the banks of the river Nerañjarā,<br />
					beneath the Goatherd's Banyan,<br />
					and he had just attained full enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> And to the Exalted One, as he meditated in privacy,<br />
					the thought arose in his mind:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"It is ill to live<br />
					paying no one the honour and obedience<br />

					<p class="f4">What recluse or brahmin is there<br />
					under whom I could live<br />
					paying him honour and respect?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the perfecting of the moral code<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					[if] imperfectly carried out,<br />
					I should live under another recluse or a brahmin,<br />
					paying him honour and respect.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I see not anywhere<br />

					—Māras, Brahmās —<br />
					not among recluses and brahmins,<br />
					not among the whole race,<br />
					human or divine,<br />
					any other recluse,<br />
					or any brahmin<br />
					more accomplished in moral conduct than myself,<br />
					and under whom I might live,<br />
					paying him honour and respect.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the perfecting of concentrative studies<br />

					<p class="f4">This Norm then,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					becoming aware in thought<br />
					of the thoughts of the Exalted One,<br />
					even like a strong man stretching his bent arm out,<br />
					or drawing together his outstretched arm,<br />
					vanished from the Brahmā world<br />
					and appeared before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					raised his joined hands towards the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">They, lord,<br />
					who in time past<br />
					were Arahants, Buddhas Supreme,<br />
					those Exalted Ones did also live only under the Norm,<br />
					honouring and respecting it.</p>

					<p class="f4">They also, lord,<br />
					who in time to come<br />
					will be Arahants, Buddhas Supreme,<br />
					they will live only under the Norm,<br />
					honouring and respecting it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One also, lord,<br />
					who now is Arahant Buddha Supreme<br />
					live only under the Norm,<br />
					honouring and respecting it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					and thereafter he spake thus: —</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They who were Buddhas in the days of yore,<br />
							And they who will be Buddhas yet to come,<br />

							Slayer of griefs for many multitudes:<br />
							All these have ever lived or<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> now do live<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Buddha was then about 35. In Manu, III, 1, the term for being <i>in statu pupillari</i> is stated to be from 9 to 36 years, for a brahmin — <i>i.e.</i> till the Vedas are mastered. Bandhāyana gives till over 48 years.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> On this and the four following branches of saintly studies, <i>cf.</i> above, III, <a href="sn01.03.021-025.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.3.24">3, § 4</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Cf. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.26.pali.bd.htm#pg77"><i>D.</i> iii, 77:</a> 'live ye having the Norm as your island, as your refuge, and no other.' The Dhamma or Norm came at one time and in one branch of Buddhism to be considered as a god (Hopkins, <i>Religions of India,</i> 249, 358; <i>cf. Manu,</i> XII, 50, 'the law'). It is just possible that this Saɱyutta passage may have been considered as bestowing the sanction for this view. (<i>Dhammo,</i> as a masculine noun, would be referred to as 'him,' and aid the growing myth. For the orthodox view <i>cf. Vin. Texts,</i> i, 91; <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.026.pali.bd.htm#pg171"><i>M.</i> i, 171,</a> translated in <i>Points of Controversy,</i> p. 169.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The text has ca, 'and.' B. guards the reader from seeing therein more than one living Buddha.</p>
