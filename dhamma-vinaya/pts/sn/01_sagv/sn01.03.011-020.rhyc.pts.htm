					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī,<br />
					in the Eastern Park,<br />
					at the Terraced House of Migāra's mother.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One<br />
					at eventide had arisen from his meditations<br />
					and was seated in the loggia outside the eastern door.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the king, the Kosalan Pasenadi, came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and having saluted him,<br />
					took a seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now just then there passed by,<br />
					not far from the Exalted One,<br />
					seven ascetics of those who wore the hair matted,<br />
					seven of the Niganthas,<br />
					seven naked ascetics,<br />
					seven of the Single Vestment class,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and seven Wanderers,<br />
					all with hairy bodies and long nails,<br />
					carrying friars' kit.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king, rising <a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> from his seat,<br />
					and draping his robe over one shoulder,<br />
					knelt down on his right knee,<br />
					and holding forth clasped hands,<br />
					thrice called out his name to those ascetics:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am the king, your reverences,<br />
					the Kosalan Pasenadi."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And when they were gone by,<br />
					he came back to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him,<br />
					sat down as before.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he asked the Exalted One: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are those persons, lord,<br />
					either among this world's Arahants,<br />
					or among those who are in the Path of Arahantship?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hard is it, sire, for you who are a layman,<br />
					holding worldly possessions,<br />
					dwelling amidst the encumbrances of children,<br />
					accustomed to Benares sandalwood,<br />
					arrayed in garlands and perfumed unguents,<br />
					using gold and silver,<br />
					to know whether those are Arahants,<br />
					or are in the Path of Arahantship.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by life in common with a person, sire,<br />
					that we learn his moral character;<br />
					and then only after a long interval<br />
					if we pay good heed and are not heedless,<br />
					if we have insight and are not unintelligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by converse with another, sire,<br />
					that we learn whether he is pure-minded;<br />
					and then only after a long interval<br />
					if we pay good heed and are not heedless,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is in time of trouble, sire,<br />
					that we learn to know a man's fortitude<br />
					and then only after a long interval,<br />

					<p class="f4">There on one occasion, five rājas,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Which of the pleasures of sense is the highest?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200">
							<p>There are five kings, four less Pasanadi, and four opinions. Since it is unlikely that any one of them would simultaneously hold that two different things were the highest, the translation of 'Ekacce' should rather be 'a certain one' 'one of such' rather than 'some'.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Which of the pleasures of sense is the highest?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The highest sensuous pleasure, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">Objects of sight are enjoyable for some,<br />

					<p class="f4">And when anyone is so gratified<br />
					and so satisfied<br />
					to all intents and purposes<br />
					by any given objects of sight,<br />

					any better thing to see<br />
					than just those objects,<br />
					then those objects are for him supreme,<br />
					those objects are for him superlative.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same, in my judgment, holds true,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a lay-adherent named Candanangalika<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> was seated among the company.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he, rising from his seat<br />

					<p class="f4">An idea is revealed to me, Blessed One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let it be revealed, Candanangalika!"<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Candanangalika, before the Exalted One,<br />

Bud- dhaghosa resolves it also into <i>veda-iha, vedena ihati,</i> or intellectual effort. Here, he says, 'there can be no question of Videha; the second meaning is right.' Ajātasattu's mother was a sister of the King of Kosala (see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.3/jat.3.338.frni.pts.htm"><i>Thusa</i></a> and <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.492.rous.pts.htm"><i>Tacchasūkara Jātakas,</i></a> <i>Comy.</i> iii, 121, iv, 342), not a Videhan.

But just as no line can be drawn, in a child's character, etc., between that which it derives from either parent, so with life lived according to the Eightfold Path.
