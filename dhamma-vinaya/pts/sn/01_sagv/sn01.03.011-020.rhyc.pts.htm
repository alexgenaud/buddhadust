					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī,<br />
					in the Eastern Park,<br />
					at the Terraced House of Migāra's mother.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One<br />
					at eventide had arisen from his meditations<br />
					and was seated in the loggia outside the eastern door.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the king, the Kosalan Pasenadi, came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and having saluted him,<br />
					took a seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now just then there passed by,<br />
					not far from the Exalted One,<br />
					seven ascetics of those who wore the hair matted,<br />
					seven of the Niganthas,<br />
					seven naked ascetics,<br />
					seven of the Single Vestment class,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and seven Wanderers,<br />
					all with hairy bodies and long nails,<br />
					carrying friars' kit.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king, rising <a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> from his seat,<br />
					and draping his robe over one shoulder,<br />
					knelt down on his right knee,<br />
					and holding forth clasped hands,<br />
					thrice called out his name to those ascetics:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am the king, your reverences,<br />
					the Kosalan Pasenadi."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And when they were gone by,<br />
					he came back to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him,<br />
					sat down as before.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he asked the Exalted One: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are those persons, lord,<br />
					either among this world's Arahants,<br />
					or among those who are in the Path of Arahantship?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hard is it, sire, for you who are a layman,<br />
					holding worldly possessions,<br />
					dwelling amidst the encumbrances of children,<br />
					accustomed to Benares sandalwood,<br />
					arrayed in garlands and perfumed unguents,<br />
					using gold and silver,<br />
					to know whether those are Arahants,<br />
					or are in the Path of Arahantship.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by life in common with a person, sire,<br />
					that we learn his moral character;<br />
					and then only after a long interval<br />
					if we pay good heed and are not heedless,<br />
					if we have insight and are not unintelligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by converse with another, sire,<br />
					that we learn whether he is pure-minded;<br />
					and then only after a long interval<br />
					if we pay good heed and are not heedless,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is in time of trouble, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Which of the pleasures of sense is the highest?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200">
							<p>There are five kings, four less Pasanadi, and four opinions. Since it is unlikely that any one of them would simultaneously hold that two different things were the highest, the translation of 'Ekacce' should rather be 'a certain one' 'one of such' rather than 'some'.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same, in my judgment, holds true,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Candanangalika, before the Exalted One,<br />

The Sutta, but with a different stanza, occurs <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#VI-2"><i>Udāna,</i> vi, 2.</a> The Buddha's prose remarks are developed in a sermon: <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/04_fours/an04.089.wood.pts.htm"><i>A.</i> ii, 89 f.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The <i>Comy.</i> directs that we read <i>pāsādadvāra-koṭṭhakassa bahi,</i> and that one of the gates in the wall that surrounded the Vihāra is not meant. Shaded at this east door from the westering sun, the Master was surveying the eastern landscape; and from where he sat the ascetics 'passing along the road near by towards the town' could be seen.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> It is said that the Nigaṇṭhas, or Jains, wore only loin-cloths, the Eka-sāṭakas (One-robers) wearing a longer waist-cloth reaching to the knee or lower.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> firesticks, a waterpot, needles, and, of course, the alms-bowl. See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm#pg125">Dialogues i. 125.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Why did the king, seated near the greatest man in all the world, do so? To conciliate them, ... in case he should ever leave the worldly life ... also to learn the Exalted One's sentiments.' <i>Comy.</i> One of the Anthology Theras, Brahmadatta, is said to have been 'a son of the king of Kosala.' See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.221.rhyc.pts.htm"><i>Pss. of the Brethren,</i> p. 223.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The story in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#VI-2">Udāna VI, 2,</a> is made to give point to a quite different stanza. In both versions the readings of 'thieves' give either <i>carā</i> or <i>corā,</i> but in <i>Majjhima</i> i, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.021.pali.bd.htm#pg129">129,</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.028.pali.bd.htm#pg186">186,</a> Trenckner gives only <i>corā.</i> That the (well-organized) trade of the <i>corā</i> should be employed as part of the King's 'secret service' is quite intelligible. <i>Ocarakā</i> is discussed in <i>Vinaya</i> iii, 52 (Sutta-vibhanga, Pārājika II.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Rāja</i> is not necessarily a king in our sense of the word, <i>e.g.</i> the Sākya nobles were all of them alluded to as rājas. <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.001.kings.htm#pg12">(<i>Cf. Buddhist India,</i> p. 12).</a> Pasenadi may have been, as mahārāja, overlord, or feudal chief to the nobles in this Sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The phrase: 'pleasures of sense' is in Pali <i>kāmānaṃ. Kāmas</i> are not exactly objects of sense, but (1) the <i>feeling</i> connected with them in (2) one <i>desiring</i> them. See this ambiguity discussed in <i>Compendium,</i> 81, n. 2. <i>Cf.</i> above, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.031-040.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.1.34">I, 4, § 4.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This is a good instance of the Vibhajjavāda method associated with Buddhism, of breaking up superficial generalizations by analysing the particularity, or personal equation, in one or both terms. B. has some interesting comments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> A fuller version than is here given in text, or in the <i>Comy.,</i> occurs in <i>Dhammapada Comy.</i> iii, 264 f., on verse 204 (<i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg508"><i>M.</i> i, 508</a>), and the verse on gross feeding in <i>Theragāthā,</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.017.rhyc.pts.htm#v17">17,</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.101.rhyc.pts.htm#v101">101,</a> is introduced. Sudassana is called the king's <i>bhagineyya</i> (nephew), and the reduction in diet is given as 3/4, viz. from a <i>doṇa</i> to a <i>nāḷika,</i> the prescribed bhikkhu rations. (<i>Cf. Rhys Davids,</i> <i>Ancient Coins,</i> etc.). Other factors contributing to the King's complacency are said to have been the treaty with Ajātasattu, and the recovery of his turban-jewel <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.03.001-010.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.3.10">(III, 1, § 10).</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Vedehiputta. Vedehi</i> means, more obviously, 'of Videha.' Bud- dhaghosa resolves it also into <i>veda-iha, vedena ihati,</i> or intellectual effort. Here, he says, 'there can be no question of Videha; the second meaning is right.' Ajātasattu's mother was a sister of the King of Kosala (see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.3/jat.3.338.frni.pts.htm"><i>Thusa</i></a> and <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.4/jat.4.492.rous.pts.htm"><i>Tacchasūkara Jātakas,</i></a> <i>Comy.</i> iii, 121, iv, 342), not a Videhan. Elsewhere the alternative meaning is allowed, namely in <i>Comy.</i> on <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.02.pali.bd.htm"><i>Dīgha</i> i, 47,</a> on <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.021.pali.bd.htm#pg125"><i>Majjhima</i> 1, 125 (<i>Kakacūpama S.</i>)</a> and on <i>Saṃyutta</i> ii, 215 (<a href="sn01.03.001-010.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.3.10">Kassapa-Saṃyutta 10</a>). Buddhaghosa's etymology is here, as often, not very plausible. But, assuming the Kosalan connection is historical, can we more plausibly derive Vedehi?</p>

Hence it only breeds more war.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> We should say 'temporal and eternal welfare.' The Buddhist never gave future life the monopofy of eternity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>Appamāda</i> is a negative term, meaning not-delay, not-dalliance, non-infatuation, from the root, or roots, <i>mad, mand,</i> 'to be exhilarated.' (See Whitney, <i>Sanskrit Roots,</i> 118.) From this source we get both the terms for such a state and those for its results and by-products: — intoxication, obsession, insanity, want of concentration and earnestness, etc. <i>Cf.</i> below, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.06.015.rhyc.pts.htm">VI, 2, § 5.</a> B. qualifies the term by the (unusual) word <i>kārāpaka</i>-: diligence in making [others] do their work.</p>

The more classical καλοκἀγαϕος — beautiful, good—is its equivalent. 'The Dhamma,' wrote B., 'was well proclaimed to all, but fulfils its object only in the hearers specified, like medicine in those who take it.' <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.03.011-020.rhyc.pts.htm#pg109">§ 4, p. 109</a> with <i>Dial</i> i, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#pg67">67 f.;</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#pg94">94 f.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, Ānanda, is supposed to have put this proposition as a question to test his own knowledge. His view put forward is that the recluse's régime yielded a result, a life, which had two parts: good friends and the shaping of individual character (<i>paccatta-purisakāra</i>). But just as no line can be drawn, in a child's character, etc., between that which it derives from either parent, so with life lived according to the Eightfold Path. The total result, as with all vital evolution, is no sum, but a product. B.'s note deserves investigation; it gives the salient 'marks' of each of the eight factors.</p>
