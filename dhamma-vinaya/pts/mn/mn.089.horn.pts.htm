					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Medaḷumpa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was the name of the market town belonging to the Sakyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Naṅgaraka<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi addressed Dīgha Kārāyana,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Kārāyana, harness some lovely vehicles;<br />
					we are going to the garden of the pleasaunce<br />
					to see its beauties."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire," and Dīgha Kārāyana,<br />
					having answered King Pasenadi in assent,<br />
					having had many lovely vehicles harnessed,<br />
					announced to King Pasenadi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Many lovely vehicles are harnessed for you, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may deem it is now the right time for that."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi, having mounted one of the lovely vehicles,<br />
					set forth from Naṅgaraka<br />
					with the many lovely vehicles<br />
					and with great royal pomp,<br />
					and drew near the park.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had gone by vehicle<br />
					as far as the ground was possible,<br />
					dismounting from the vehicle,<br />
					he entered the park on foot.</p>

					<p class="f4">As King Pasenadi was pacing up and down in the park<br />
					and roaming about on foot<br />
					he saw charming and attractive roots of trees,<br />
					quiet and silent,<br />
					without folk's breath,<br />
					far from the haunts of men,<br />
					suitable for solitary meditation.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing them,<br />
					he began to remember the Lord,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is at these charming and attractive roots of trees,<br />
					quiet and silent,<br />
					without folk's breath,<br />
					far from the haunts of men,<br />
					suitable for solitary meditation,<br />
					that we <a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> can pay homage to that Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi addressed Dīgha Kārāyana, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, good Kārāyana,<br />
					at these charming and attractive roots of trees,<br />
					quiet and silent,<br />
					without folk's breath,<br />
					far from the haunts of men,<br />
					suitable for solitary meditation,<br />
					that we can pay homage to this Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, good Kārāyana,<br />
					is this Lord staying at present,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, there is a market town of the Sakyans called Medaḷumpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord, perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					is staying there at present."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, how far, good Kārāyana, is Medaḷumpa,<br />
					the market town of the Sakyans,<br />
					from Naṅgaraka?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not far, sire;<br />
					it is three yojams.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is possible to get to it<br />
					in what remains of the day."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, good Kārāyana,<br />
					harness many lovely vehicles,<br />
					we will go to see this Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire," and Dīgha Kārāyana,<br />
					having answered King Pasenadi in assent,<br />
					having had many lovely vehicles harnessed,<br />
					announced to King Pasenadi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Many lovely vehicles are harnessed for you, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may deem it is now the right time for that."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi, having mounted one of the lovely vehicles,<br />
					set forth from Naṅgaraka<br />
					with the many lovely vehicles<br />
					and drew near Medaḷumpa,<br />
					the market town of the Sakyans,<br />
					arriving there in what remained of that day,<br />
					and approached the park.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he had gone by vehicle as far as the ground was possible,<br />
					dismounting from the vehicle,<br />
					he entered the park on foot.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time several monks<br />
					were pacing up and down in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi approached these monks;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to these monks;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where, revered sirs, is the Lord staying at present,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One?</p>

					<p class="f4">We are anxious to see the Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, this is the dwelling-place;<br />
					the door is closed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached quietly,<br />
					having entered the verandah<br />
					(but) not crossing it,<br />
					having coughed,<br />
					tap on the door-bolt.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord will open the door to you."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi immediately handed his sword and turban<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> to Dīgha Kārāyana,.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to Dīgha Kārāyana,:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The King wants to be alone now;<br />
					must I now remain just where I am?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi having quietly approached <a id="pg303"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></a> that dwelling-place with its closed door,<br />
					having entered the verandah<br />
					(but) not crossing it,<br />
					coughed<br />
					and tapped on the door-bolt.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord opened the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi, having entered the dwelling-place,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having inclined his head to the Lord's feet,<br />
					kissed the Lord's feet on all sides with his mouth<br />
					and stroked them on all sides with his hands,<br />
					and he made known his (own) name;</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am King Pasenadi of Kosala;</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, am King Pasenadi of Kosala."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But for what special reason do you, sire,<br />
					pay such deep respect to this body<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and display such tokens of friendship?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, for me there is a logical consequence<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> of the Lord's <i><i>Dhamma</i></i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, see some recluses and brahmans here,<br />
					faring a restricted Brahma-faring for ten,<br />
					twenty,<br />
					thirty<br />
					and forty years.</p>

					<p class="f4">After a time<br />
					these,<br />
					well washed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					well anointed,<br />
					with their hair and beards trimmed,<br />
					parade about in the full possession<br />
					and enjoyment<br />
					of the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand I, revered sir,<br />
					see monks here<br />
					faring a perfectly fulfilled,<br />
					perfectly purified Brahma-faring<br />
					all their lives long<br />
					until their last breath.</p>

					<p class="f4">And outside this, revered sir,<br />
					I behold no other Brahma-faring<br />
					so perfectly fulfilled<br />
					and perfectly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, revered sir, is a logical consequence of the Lord's <i>Dhamma</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, revered sir,<br />
					kings quarrel with kings,<br />
					and nobles quarrel with nobles,<br />
					and brahmans quarrel with brahmans,<br />
					and householders quarrel with householders,<br />
					and a mother quarrels with a child,<br />
					and a child quarrels with the mother,<br />
					and a father quarrels with a child,<br />
					and a child quarrels with the father,<br />
					and a brother quarrels with a brother,<br />
					and a brother quarrels with a sister,<br />
					and a sister quarrels with a brother,<br />
					and friend quarrels with friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, revered sir,<br />
					see monks here living on friendly terms and harmonious,<br />
					not quarrelling,<br />
					like milk and water blending,<br />
					regarding one another with the eye of affection.</p>

					<p class="f4">But outside this, revered sir, I <a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> behold no other such harmonious company.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this too, revered sir, is for me a logical consequence of Lord's <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, I, revered sir,<br />
					pace up and down<br />
					and roam about<br />
					from one park to another,<br />
					from one pleasaunce to another.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there I see some recluses and brahmans<br />
					who are thin,<br />
					wretched,<br />
					their colour bad,<br />
					yellowish,<br />
					their veins standing out on their limbs,<br />
					methinks not at all pleasing to behold.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it occurs to me thus, revered sir:</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly these venerable ones are faring the Brahma-faring displeased,<br />
					or there is some evil kamma done by them and concealed<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and that is why these venerable ones are thin, wretched,<br />
					their colour bad,<br />
					yellowish,<br />
					their veins standing out on their limbs,<br />
					methinks not at all pleasing to behold.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, approaching these venerable ones, I speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it that you, venerable ones, are thin,<br />
					wretched,<br />
					their colour bad,<br />
					yellowish,<br />
					their veins standing out on their limbs,<br />
					methinks not at all pleasing to behold?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is an illness that runs in our families,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand I, revered sir,<br />
					see monks here who are very joyful,<br />
					very exultant,<br />
					looking contented and cheerful,<br />
					living unconcerned,<br />
					unruffled,<br />
					dependent on others,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with a mind become as a wild creature's.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it occurs to me, revered sir:</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly these venerable ones<br />
					recognise a high excellence in the Lord's teaching,<br />
					a gradual accomplishing,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and that is why these venerable ones are very joyful,<br />
					very exultant,<br />
					looking contented and cheerful,<br />
					living unconcerned,<br />
					unruffled,<br />
					dependent on others,<br />
					with a mind become as a wild creature's.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this too is for me, revered sir, a logical consequence of the Lord's <i>Dhamma</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, revered sir, I,<br />
					a noble anointed king,<br />
					am able to execute one deserving execution,<br />
					to fine one deserving to be fined,<br />
					to banish one deserving banishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I am sitting on a case,<br />
					people sometimes speak interrupting (me).</p>

					<p class="f4">And I get no chance to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'While I am sitting on the case<br />
					do not, good sirs, speak<br />
					interrupting (me).</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the good sirs wait until I have finished speaking,'</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, revered sir,<br />
					see monks here<br />
					at a time when the Lord is teaching <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					to various assemblies,<br />
					and at that time<br />
					there is no sound of expectorating<br />
					among the Lord's disciples,<br />
					no <a id="pg305"><span class="f2 g"><b>[305]</b></span></a> sound of coughing.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, revered sir,<br />
					when the Lord was teaching <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					to various assemblies<br />
					a certain disciple of the Lord coughed;<br />
					one of his fellow Brahma-farers tapped his knee and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one be quiet,<br />
					let the venerable one make no noise;<br />
					the Lord, our Teacher, is teaching <i>Dhamma</i>'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In connection with this it occurred to me, revered sir:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, it is wonderful,<br />
					indeed it is marvellous;<br />
					assuredly, how well trained -<br />
					without stick,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					without sword -<br />
					must be such an assembly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And outside this, revered sir,<br />
					I see no other assembly well trained thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this too is for me, revered sir,<br />
					a logical consequence of the Lord's <i>Dhamma</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, revered sir,<br />
					I see here some clever nobles,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					subtle,<br />
					practised in disputing with others,<br />
					skilled in hair-splitting,<br />
					who go about, methinks,<br />
					breaking to pieces<br />
					in their wisdom<br />
					the views (of others).</p>

					<p class="f4">These hear:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Undoubtedly the recluse Gotama will visit a certain village or market town.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They construct a question, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having approached the recluse Gotama,<br />
					we will ask him this question of ours.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on being asked by us thus,<br />
					he answers thus,<br />
					we will refute him thus;<br />
					and if,<br />
					on being asked by us thus,<br />
					he answers thus,<br />
					we will refute him thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These hear:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is certain that the recluse Gotama is visiting a certain village or market town.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they approach the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord gladdens,<br />
					rouses,<br />
					incites,<br />
					delights them<br />
					with talk on <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted by the Lord<br />
					with talk on <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					do not ask the Lord the question at all -<br />
					whence can they refute him?</p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary, they become the Lord's disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is for me, revered sir,<br />

					do not ask the Lord the question at all -<br />
					whence can they refute him?</p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary,<br />
					they ask leave of the Lord himself<br />
					for the going forth from home into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord lets them go forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, gone forth like this,<br />
					living alone,<br />
					aloof,<br />
					<a id="pg306"><span class="f2 g"><b>[306]</b></span></a> diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					having by their own super-knowledge<br />
					soon realized here and now<br />
					that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					entering on it, abide in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">These speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed we were nearly lost,<br />
					indeed we were nearly lost,<br />
					for while we were formerly not (true) recluses,<br />
					we claimed that we were,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">We are recluses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not being (true) brahmans,<br />
					we claimed that we were<br />
					saying;</p>

					<p class="f4">We are brahmans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not being (true) perfected ones, we claimed that we were saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">We are perfected ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now we really are recluses,<br />
					now we really are brahmans,<br />
					now we really are perfected ones.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is for me, revered sir,<br />
					a logical consequence of the Lord's <i>Dhamma</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, revered sir,<br />
					I see here the equerries<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> Isīdatta and Purāṇa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					whose food is mine,<br />
					whose vehicles are mine,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for whom I provide a livelihood<br />
					and to whom I bring fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet they do not pay me respect<br />
					as they do the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, revered sir,<br />
					while marching against an army,<br />
					in order to test these same equerries,<br />
					Isldatta and Purāṇa, I took up my quarters in some cramped habitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, revered sir, these equerries, Isīdatta and Purāṇa,<br />
					having passed the greater part of the night<br />
					in talk on <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					lay down with their heads directed<br />
					towards where they had heard that the Lord was,<br />
					their feet towards me.</p>

					<p class="f4">In connection with this, revered sir,<br />
					it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it is wonderful,<br />
					indeed it is marvellous.</p>

					<p class="f4">These equerries, Isīdatta and Purāṇa,<br />
					whose food is mine,<br />
					whose vehicles are mine,<br />
					for whom I provide a livelihood<br />
					and to whom I bring fame,<br />
					yet do not pay me respect<br />
					as they do the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly these venerable ones<br />
					recognise a high excellence<br />
					in this Lord's teaching,<br />
					a gradual accomplishing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And this too is for me, revered sir,<br />
					a logical consequence of the Lord's teaching:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-Awakened One is the Lord,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Lord's Order of disciples fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, revered sir,<br />
					the Lord is a noble,<br />
					I too am a noble;<br />
					the Lord is a Kosalan,<br />
					I too am a Kosalan;<br />
					the Lord is round about eighty years of age,<br />
					I too am round about eighty years of age.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because the Lord is a noble<br />
					and I am a noble,<br />
					because the Lord is a <a id="pg307"><span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span></a> Kosalan<br />
					and I am a Kosalan,<br />
					because the Lord is round about eighty years of age<br />
					and I am round about eighty years of age<br />
					that I am disposed, revered sir,<br />
					to pay deep respect to the Lord<br />
					and display tokens of friendship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Please, revered sir,<br />
					I must be going now,<br />
					I am very busy,<br />
					there is much to be done."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do now, sire,<br />
					that for which you deem it<br />
					to be the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi, rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed<br />
					keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after King Pasenadi had departed,<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, that is King Pasenadi of Kosala who,<br />
					having spoken testimonies to <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span><br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					is departing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Learn, monks, the testimonies to <i>Dhamma</i>;<br />
					master, monks, the testimonies to <i>Dhamma</i>;<br />
					remember, monks, the testimonies to <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Connected with the goal, monks,<br />
					are the testimonies to <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					fundamental to the Brahma-faring."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

Therefore, if paid to the Lord, it is paid to <i>Dhamma,</i> and so tho Lord spoke of 'testimonies to <i>Dhamma</i>.' "Cetiya usually means a (sepulchral) monument, from a root meaning to pile up, and in this Discourse Chalmers renders by "monuments "and Neumann by "Denkmale." The memorial monuments of India are, however, also in the nature of testimony to tho virtues, etc. of the deceased person in whose honour they are erected. I hope the use of this word here does not take us too far from the meaning intended. "Attestations" might also have been chosen.</p>
