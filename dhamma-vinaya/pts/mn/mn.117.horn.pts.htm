					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>sa-upanisā.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> ii. 29 <i>ff.</i> "The history of this word has yet to be written," <i>P.E.D.</i> s.v. <i>upanisā.</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 130 gives it the meaning of <i>paccaya,</i> condition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>pubbaŋgama,</i> it is the fore-goer, <i>purecārika,</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 131. Right view is twofold: that of insight, <i>vipassanā,</i> and that of the Way. The former examines the three kinds of activities (<i>saŋkhāra:</i> of body, speech and thought) in respect of impermanence, etc. But the latter arises at the end of the examination while rooting out and allaying the stage that has been attained, <i>MA.</i> iv. 130. At <i>MA.</i> iv. 135 it is said, "In this Discourse there are five kinds of right view: through insight, of specific kamma (cf. <i>Dhs.</i> 1366, <i>Vbh.</i> 328, <i>MA.</i> v. 10), of the Way, of the fruits, through reflection on."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> This is right view through insight, <i>MA.</i> iv. 135.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> i. 287, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>D.</i> i. 8, <i>Vism.</i> 6 <i>ff.</i> for these five words. The first, <i>kuhanā,</i> means according to <i>MA.</i> iv. 134, <i>DA.</i> 91, that these people trick (deceive or delude, <i>kuhayanti</i>) the world and astonish it with three kinds of tricks. These are referred to at <i>Jā.</i> iv. 297. These five words also occur at <i>A.</i> iii. Ill, and the actions (trickery, etc.) are explained at <i>Vbh.</i> 352 <i>f.,</i> <i>Vism.</i> 23; <i>cf.</i> <i>VbhA.</i> 471. On <i>kuhanā</i> and <i>lapanā</i> <i>cf.</i> the phrases <i>janakuhanattha janalapanattha</i> at <i>M.</i> i. 465, <i>A.</i> ii. 26, <i>Iti.</i> pp. 28, 29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>lapanā.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Vism.</i> 26 <i>f.;</i> also <i>Iti.</i> §99 = <i>A.</i> i. 165, 168. <i>Lapakā,</i> translated at <i>Dial.</i> i. 15 "droners out (of holy words for pay)"; at <i>G.S.</i> iii. 88 "ranter"; at <i>Min.Anth.</i> ii. 186 (<i>lapita-lāpa</i>) "mere mutterings"; at <i>Path Purity</i> i. 27 "boasters." I follow <i>G.S.</i> ii. 28 and <i>Min.Anth.</i> ii. 136. <i>MA.</i> iv. 134: "they cajole for the sake of gains and honour."</p>

This it may easily mean. But in the above context the whole stress is on deceitful ways, unspecified, of obtaining gains and honours.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>nippesikatā.</i> I follow translation at <i>G.S.</i> iii. 88. For <i>nippesika</i> <i>Dial.</i> i. 16 gives exorcists, and <i>P.E.D.</i> juggler. But I see no need to be so definite. <i>MA.</i> iv. 134 says: <i>nippeso sīlam etesan ti nippesikā, tesaṁ bhāvo nippesikatā.</i> <i>AA.</i> iii. 273 says: <i>nippesiko ti nippiṁsanakathāya samannāgato.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>sammādiṭṭhissa;</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 134 explains this as meaning "of the man, <i>puggalassa,</i> who is established in the right view of the Way." So the meaning may bo more literally: "proceeds for one of right view," etc. <i>MA.</i> iv. 135 says that here "right view of the Way and right view of the fruits" are both being spoken of; see above, p. 114, <i>n.</i> 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 135 says here "right view through reflection on" is being spoken of.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 135 says that the repeaters of the remaining Nikāyas say the "fruit" is being spoken of, but the <i>M.</i> repeaters say the "Way" is being spoken of in the ten items to be worn away.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 135: ten beginning with right view and ten come under "various skilled things conditioned by right view."</p>
