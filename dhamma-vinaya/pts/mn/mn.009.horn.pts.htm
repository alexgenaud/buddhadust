							<p>"<i>MA. i. 221 says..." [n27]</i> It is not easy to understand what this note is supposed to mean. The <i>Sankhāras</i> are acts of thought, word, and deed or the results of such. The <i>khandhas</i> are <i>rūpa, vedanā, sannā, sankhāra and viññāṇa.</i> <i>Vedanā, sannā, cetanā, phasso, and manasikāro</i> (sense-experience, perception, intent, contact, and mental-study) are in this sutta said to be five things that define <i>'nāma,'</i> 'name' (Horner's 'mind'). Then in this note: Intent, contact, and mental-study (the better order would be mental-study, intent and (making) contact) are what 'form' own-making <i>(sankhāra).</i> What does 'form' mean? If it means 'constitute' this is not correct as the sankaras also include that which is formed by intent, etc. which would include feeling and perception. If 'form' means 'to shape,' 'are the bases for the formation of,' this is also not absolutely correct as feeling and perception are the objects of mental study, intent and the effort to contact, round and round, but the meaning could be that these three are the volitional aspects of the cycle, the own-making part that produces the own-made part.<br />
							If the meaning is this latter, I would re-state it this way: 'Sense-experiences, perceptions, intents, contacts, and mental-studies' are the categories which encompass that which is 'named'; The four great elements and the shapes derived from them are the categories which encompass that which is 'formed'. Own-making results in both, bound up together, and called 'named-forms'. In contact with the consciousness that arises in connection with named-forms, individuality, in the form of the <i>khandhas</i> is the end result. Those aspects of the individuality that roll on the process are work-of-mind, intent and effort to contact. In the <i>khandha</i> classification scheme, those three could all be put under <i>'sankhāra'</i>.</p>

							<p><i>[n34]</i> A perfect argument for ignoring the commentaries. That the end of samsaric existence is inconceivable may be, but this argument does not prove it. The commentator likely felt the need to make this point as a result of knowledge of the Mahayana Bodhisattva vow to abstain from entering Nibbāna until all sentient beings can do so at the same time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 223 <i>f.</i> says: "Here the cankers of sense-pleasures and becoming are, through co-naseence, the causes (or conditions) of ignorance." And again, "Ignorance is the cause, through co-nascence, of the cankers of sense-pleasures and becoming ... This exposition of the cankers is spoken of as an explanation of the conditions of that chief ignorance which is among the clauses of 'dependent origination.' Through the exposition made known thus, the fact that the end of <i>samsāric</i> existence is inconceivable is proved. How? From the arising of ignorance is the arising of the cankers; from the arising of the cankers is the arising of ignorance. Having made the cankers the cause of ignorance and ignorance the cause of the cankers, the earliest point of ignorance is not perceptible, therefore the fact that the end of <i>samsāric</i> existence is inconceivable is proved."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 224 says that only in this Discourse, even in the whole great fivefold classified collection of the Buddha's words, are the four truths proclaimed thirty-two times and arahantship thirty-two times.</p>
