					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p4">4</a>]</span> And how, monks, does a monk fare along contemplating the body in the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> monks, a monk who is forest-gone or gone to the root of a tree or gone to an empty place,<br />
					sits down cross-legged,<br />
					holding his back erect,<br />
					arousing mindfulness in front of him.<br />
					Mindful he breathes in,<br />
					mindful he breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he is breathing in a long (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in <a id="pg72"><span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span></a> a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a short (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a short (breath).'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is like a clever turner or turner's apprentice who,<br />
					making a long (turn), comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am making a long (turn)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when making a short (turn) comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am making a short (turn).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, does a monk who is breathing in a long (breath) comprehend,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when breathing breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when breathing breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a short (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when breathing breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a short (breath).'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'</p>
