					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk fare along contemplating the body in the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> monks, a monk who is forest-gone or gone to the root of a tree or gone to an empty place,<br />
					sits down cross-legged,<br />
					holding his back erect,<br />
					arousing mindfulness in front of him.<br />
					Mindful he breathes in,<br />
					mindful he breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he is breathing in a long (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in <a id="pg72"><span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span></a> a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a short (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a short (breath).'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is like a clever turner or turner's apprentice who,<br />
					making a long (turn), comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am making a long (turn)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when making a short (turn) comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am making a short (turn).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, does a monk who is breathing in a long (breath) comprehend,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when breathing breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when breathing breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a short (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when breathing breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a short (breath).'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, monks, he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body,<br />
					or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body,<br />
					or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Or, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is the body,'</p>

					<p class="f4">his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge,<br />
					just for remembrance,<br />
					and he fares along independently of<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and not grasping anything in the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a monk,<br />
					when he is walking, comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am walking';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when he is standing still, comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am <a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> standing still';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when he is sitting down,<a id="pt57" href="../../pali/mn/mn.010.pali.bd.htm#pg57"><span class="f2">[57]</span></a>comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am sitting down';</p>

					<p class="f4">or when he is lying down, comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am lying down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So that however his body is disposed<br />
					he comprehends that it is like that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally,<br />
					or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally,<br />
					or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body,<br />

					when he is eating, drinking, chewing, tasting<br />

					is one, acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he is walking, standing, sitting, asleep, awake, talking, silent,<br />
					he is one acting in a clearly conscious way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally,<br />

					<p class="f4">Or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body,<br />
