					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a sower does not sow a crop<br />
					for herds of deer,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the herds of deer,<br />
					enjoying this crop sown by me,<br />
					flourish in good condition<br />
					for many a long day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the sower sows the crop<br />
					for herds of deer<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The herds of deer will eat fodder<br />
					encroaching entranced<br />

					<p><b>[The First Herd of Deer]</b></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks,<br />
					the first herd of deer ate fodder<br />
					encroaching entranced<br />
					on this crop sown by the sower;<br />
					encroaching entranced and eating the fodder<br />
					these got elated;<br />

					being careless<br />
					they became those<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, this first herd of deer<br />

					<p><b>[The Second Herd of Deer]</b></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that we should all refrain<br />
					from eating the crops;<br />
					and refraining from enjoyment<br />
					where there is fear,<br />

					<p class="f4">So all these refrained<br />
					from eating the crops;<br />
					and refraining from enjoyment<br />
					where there was fear,<br />

					they stayed there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the last month of the hot weather<br />
					the grass and water gave out,<br />
					and their bodies became extremely emaciated<br />
					so that their strength and energy diminished,<br />
					and with diminished strength and energy<br />
					they came back again to those crops<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose that we were to make a lair<br />

					<p class="f4">Having made our lair there,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that we were to enclose<br />

					<p class="f4">So these enclosed that crop that was sown<br />

					<p class="f4">But, monks, neither the sower nor his companions<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If we beat up this fourth herd of deer,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, monks, neither the sower nor his companions<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this parable was made by me<br />

					<p class="f4">And just this is the meaning here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The crop,' monks,<br />
					this is a synonym for the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The sower,' monks,<br />
					this is a name for Māra, the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The sower's companions,' monks,<br />
					this is a synonym for Māra's companions.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The herds of deer,' monks,</p>

					<p class="f4">this is a synonym for recluses and brahmans.</p>

					<p><b>[The First Kind of Recluse and Brahman]</b></p>
