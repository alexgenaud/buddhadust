					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Ujuññā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the deer-park at Kaṇṇakatthala.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time King Pasenadi <a id="pg308"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span></a> of Kosala had arrived at Ujuññā<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi addressed a certain man,<br />
					saying;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, my good man,<br />
					approach the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head<br />
					and ask whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort,<br />
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, King Pasenadi salutes the Lord's feet with his head,<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort';<br />
					and then speak thus:<br />
					'Revered sir, today after the meal<br />
					when he has had breakfast,<br />
					King Pasenadi is expecting to come to see the Lord.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire,"<br />
					and that man,<br />
					having answered King Pasenadi in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					that man spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, King Pasenadi salutes the Lord's feet with his head,<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, today after the meal<br />
					when he has had breakfast,<br />
					King Pasenadi is expecting to come to see the Lord.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">The sisters Somā and Sakulā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Today after the meal<br />
					when he has had breakfast,<br />
					King Pasenadi is expecting to go to see the Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the sisters Somā and Sakulā,<br />
					having approached the place where King Pasenadi was eating,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, sire,<br />
					in our names salute the Lord's feet with your head<br />
					and ask whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā salute the Lord's feet with their heads<br />
					and ask whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after the meal<br />
					when King Pasenadi had eaten his breakfast,<br />
					he approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā<br />
					with their heads salute the Lord's feet<br />
					and ask whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how is it, sire,<br />
					that the sisters Somā and Sakulā<br />
					were not able to send another messenger?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā heard:<br />
					'Today after the meal<br />
					when he has had breakfast,<br />
					King Pasenadi is expecting to go to see the Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā<br />
					having approached me in the place where I was eating,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg309"><span class="f2 g"><b>[309]</b></span></a> 'Well then, sire,<br />
					in our names salute the Lord's feet with your head<br />

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, the sisters Somā and Sakulā salute the Lord's feet with their heads<br />

					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"May the sisters Somā and Sakulā be happy, sire."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard this about you, revered sir:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is neither a recluse nor a brahman<br />
					who, all-knowing, all-seeing,<br />
					can claim all-embracing knowledge-and-vision -<br />
					this situation does not exist."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, those who speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is neither a recluse nor a brahman<br />
					who, all-knowing, all-seeing,<br />
					can claim all-embracing knowledge-and-vision -<br />
					this situation does not exist."'</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that these, revered sir,<br />
					speak what was spoken by the Lord,<br />
					that they do not misrepresent the Lord<br />
					by what is not fact,<br />
					that they explain <i>dhamma</i><br />
					according to <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					and that no reasoned thesis<br />
					gives occasion for contempt?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Those, sire, who speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is neither a recluse nor a brahman<br />
					who, all-knowing, all-seeing,<br />
					can claim all-embracing knowledge-and-vision -<br />
					this situation does not exist."'</p>

					<p class="f4">these do not speak as I spoke<br />
					but are misrepresenting me<br />
					with what is not true,<br />
					with what is not fact."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi addressed the commander-in-chief, Viḍūḍabha,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, who was it, commander-in-chief,<br />
					that brought this subject of conversation into the palace?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan, sire."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi summoned a man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, my good man,<br />
					in my name summon the brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'King Pasenadi, revered sir, is summoning you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your majesty,"<br />
					and when this man had answered King Pasenadi in assent<br />
					he approached the brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan;<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to the brahman Sañjaya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"King Pasenadi is summoning you, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Could it be, revered sir,<br />
					that people might have transferred<br />
					to quite another topic<br />
					something (originally) said by the Lord<br />
					in reference to something else?</p>

					<p class="f4">In regard to what, revered sir,<br />
					does the Lord claim to have spoken the words?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, sire, claim to have spoken the words thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is neither a <a id="pg310"><span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span></a> recluse nor a brahman<br />
					who at one and the same time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					can know all,<br />
					can see all -<br />
					this situation does not exist.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the Lord speaks causally,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and it is in reference to cause,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />
					that the Lord says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is neither a recluse nor a brahman<br />
					who at one and the same time<br />
					can know all,<br />
					can see all -<br />
					this situation does not exist.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">These, revered sir, are the four castes:<br />
					nobles,<br />
					brahmans,<br />
					merchants<br />
					and workers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, revered sir,<br />
					could there be any distinction,<br />
					any difference,<br />
					between these four castes?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are, sire, the four castes:<br />
					nobles,<br />
					brahmans,<br />
					merchants<br />
					and workers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among these four castes, sire,<br />
					two are pointed to as chief:<br />
					the nobles and the brahmans,<br />
					that is to say in the way of addressing them,<br />
					rising up from one's seat for them,<br />
					saluting them with joined palms<br />
					and rendering them service."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am not asking the Lord<br />
					about the here and now; revered sir,<br />
					I am asking the Lord about a future state.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, revered sir, are the four castes:<br />
					nobles,<br />
					brahmans,<br />
					merchants<br />
					and workers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, revered sir, could there be any distinction,<br />
					any difference<br />
					between these four castes?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, there are these five qualities for striving.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, sire,<br />
					a monk has faith;<br />
					he has faith in the awakening of the Tathāgata, and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this is the Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and men,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is well,<br />
					in good health,<br />
					endowed with a good digestion,<br />
					not over-cool,<br />
					not over-hot,<br />
					but of a middle kind<br />
					suitable for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not fraudulent,<br />
					not deceitful,<br />
					but shows himself as he really is<br />
					to the Teacher<br />
					or the learned<br />
					among his fellow Brahma-farers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with energy stirred up<br />
					for getting rid of unskilled states,<br />
					for arousing skilled states,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					firm in advance,<br />
					persevering amid skilled states.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one of wisdom<br />
					endowed with wisdom<br />
					leading to (the cutting off of) rise and fall,<br />
					with ariyan discrimination<br />
					leading to the complete destruction of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, sire, are the five qualities for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, sire, are the four castes:<br />
					nobles,<br />
					brahmans,<br />
					merchants<br />
					and workers.</p>

					<p class="f4">These might be possessed of these five qualities for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time<br />
					that would be for their welfare and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, revered sir, are the four castes:<br />
					nobles,<br />
					brahmans,<br />
					merchants<br />
					and workers;<br />
					and these might be possessed of the five qualities for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, revered sir, might there be among them here<br />
					any distinction,<br />
					any difference?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, sire, here speak of a divergence in striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> there might be, sire,<br />
					among elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen to be tamed<br />
					two elephants,<br />
					two horses<br />
					or two oxen<br />
					that were well tamed,<br />
					well trained<br />
					and two that were not tamed,<br />
					not trained.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about <a id="pg311"><span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span></a> this, sire?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would those two elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen<br />
					that were to be tamed<br />
					and that were well tamed,<br />
					well trained -<br />
					would these,<br />
					on being tamed,<br />
					reach tamed capacity,<br />
					would they,<br />
					being tamed,<br />
					attain tamed rank?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But those two elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen<br />
					that were to be tamed<br />
					but that were neither tamed<br />
					nor trained -<br />
					would these,<br />
					not being tamed,<br />
					reach tamed capacity,<br />
					and would they,<br />
					not being tamed,<br />
					attain tamed rank<br />
					as do the two elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen<br />
					to be tamed<br />
					that were well tamed,<br />
					well trained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, sire,<br />
					that which may be achieved by faith,<br />
					by good health,<br />
					by honesty<br />
					and absence of deceit,<br />
					by output of energy,<br />
					by wisdom -<br />
					that one of no faith,<br />
					of poor health,<br />
					fraudulent and deceitful,<br />
					lazy,<br />
					weak in wisdom<br />
					could attain it -<br />
					this situation does not exist."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the Lord speaks causally,<br />
					and it is in reference to cause,<br />
					revered sir,<br />
					that the Lord speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, revered sir,<br />
					are the four castes:<br />
					nobles,<br />
					brahmans,<br />
					merchants<br />
					and workers.</p>

					<p class="f4">These might be possessed<br />
					of the five qualities for striving,<br />
					and if they made the proper efforts<br />
					would there be between them, revered sir,<br />
					any distinction,<br />
					any difference?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, sire, here speak of no difference,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					in freedom as against freedom.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as though a man, sire,<br />
					bringing dry sticks from a teak tree<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					were to produce a fire<br />
					and heat were to result.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another man,<br />
					bringing dry sticks from a sāl-tree<br />
					were to produce a fire<br />
					and heat were to result.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another man,<br />
					bringing dry sticks from a mango-tree<br />
					were to produce a fire<br />
					and heat were to result.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another man,<br />
					bringing dry sticks from a fig tree<br />
					were to produce a fire<br />
					and heat were to result.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, sire?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the different woods used for the fires,<br />
					would there be any difference in what is produced,<br />
					in flame as against flame,<br />
					in hue as against hue,<br />
					in brilliance as against brilliance?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so it is, sire,<br />
					with heat created by energy,<br />
					produced by striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not speak of any difference there,<br />
					that is in freedom as against freedom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the Lord speaks causally,<br />
					and it is in reference to cause<br />
					that the Lord speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, honoured sir, are there <i>devas?"</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg312"><span class="f2 g"><b>[312]</b></span></a> "How can yon, sire, speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, revered sir, are there <i>devas?'</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it that these <i>devas,</i> revered sir,<br />
					are returners<br />
					to a state of being such or so,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or be it<br />
					that they are not returners<br />
					to a state of being such or so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, whatever <i>devas</i> have been malevolent<br />
					are returners to a state of being such or so;<br />
					whatever <i>devas</i> have not been malevolent<br />
					are not returners to a state of being such or so."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the commander-in-chief, Viḍūḍabha,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, can those <i>devas</i> that are malevolent<br />
					and are returners<br />
					to a state of being such or so<br />
					drive away<br />
					or banish from that place<br />
					those devas that have not been malevolent<br />
					and are not returners<br />
					to a state of being such or so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This Viḍūḍabha, the commander-in-chief,<br />
					is a son of King Pasenadi;<br />
					I am the Lord's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a time when son<br />
					might confer with son."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda addressed Viḍūḍabha, the commander-in-chief,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well now, commander-in-chief,<br />
					on this point<br />
					I will ask yon something in return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer exactly as it seems right to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, commander-in-chief?</p>

					<p class="f4">As far as the realm of King Pasenadi (extends),<br />
					and there where King Pasenadi holds dominion and sway,<br />
					is King Pasenadi able to drive away<br />
					or banish from that place<br />
					a recluse or a brahman<br />
					whether he is meritorious<br />
					or not meritorious,<br />
					whether he is a BrahmaḤfarer<br />
					or not a Brahxna-farer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, as far as the realm of King Pasenadi (extends)<br />
					and there where King Pasenadi holds dominion and sway,<br />
					King Pasenadi is able to drive away<br />
					or banish from that place<br />
					a recluse or a brahman<br />
					whether he is meritorious or not<br />
					or not meritorious,<br />
					whether he is a BrahmaḤfarer<br />
					or not a Brahxna-farer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, commander-in-chief?</p>

					<p class="f4">As far as the realm of King Pasenadi does not (extend),<br />
					and there where King Pasenadi holds no dominion or sway,<br />
					is King Pasenadi able to drive away<br />
					or banish from that place<br />
					a recluse or a brahman<br />
					whether he is meritorious<br />
					or not meritorious,<br />
					whether he is a Brahma-farer<br />
					or not a Brahma-farer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, as far as the realm of King Pasenadi does not (extend),<br />
					and there where King Pasenadi holds no dominion or sway,<br />
					King Pasenadi is not able to drive away<br />

					a recluse or a brahman<br />
					whether he is meritorious<br />
					or not meritorious,<br />
					whether he is a Brahma-farer<br />
					or not a Brahma-farer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about, this, commander-in-chief?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you heard of the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> "Yes, good sir, I have heard of the devas of the Thirty-Three<br />
					and the good King Pasenadi has also heard of the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, commander-in-chief?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is King Pasenadi able to drive away<br />
					or banish from that place<br />
					the devas of the Thirty-Three?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sir, King Pasenadi is not even able to see the devas of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then could he drive them away<br />
					or banish them from that place?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, commander-in-chief,<br />
					those <i>devas</i> that have been malevolent<br />
					and are returners<br />
					to a state of being such or so<br />
					are not even able to see those devas<br />
					that have not been malevolent<br />
					and are not returners<br />
					to a state of being such or so.</p>

					<p class="f4">So how could they drive them away<br />
					or banish them from that place?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, revered sir, is this monk's name?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"His name is Ānanda, sire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bliss<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> indeed,<br />
					indeed blissful!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, the venerable Ānanda speaks causally<br />
					and it is in reference to cause,<br />
					revered sir, that the venerable Ānanda speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, revered sir, is there a Brahmā?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How can you, sire, speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is there a Brahmā?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be it that this Brahmā, revered sir,<br />
					is a returner to the state of being such or so,<br />
					or be it that he is not a returner<br />
					to a state of being such or so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, whatever Brahmā has been malevolent<br />
					is a returner to a state of being such or so;<br />
					but whatever Brahmā has not been malevolent<br />
					is not a returner to a state of being such or so."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain man spoke thus to King Pasenadi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan has arrived, sire."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the brahman Sañjaya of the Ākāsa clan:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, who was it, brahman,<br />
					that brought this subject of conversation into the palace?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Viḍūḍabha, sire, the commander-in-chief."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The commander-in-chief, Viḍūḍabha, speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The brahman Sañjaya, sire, of the Ākāsa clan.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain man spoke thus to King Pasenadi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time for the vehicle, sire."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We, revered sir, questioned the Lord about omniscience;<br />
					the Lord <a id="pg314"><span class="f2 g"><b>[314]</b></span></a> explained omniscience,<br />
					and because it was pleasing to us<br />
					and approved<br />
					we are delighted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, we questioned the Lord about the purity of the four castes;<br />
					the Lord explained the purity of the four castes,<br />
					and because it was pleasing to us<br />
					and approved<br />
					we are delighted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, we questioned the Lord about the <i>devas;</i><br />
					the Lord explained the <i>devas,</i><br />
					and because it was pleasing to us<br />
					and approved<br />
					we are delighted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, we questioned the Lord about Brahmāā;<br />
					the Lord explained about Brahmā,<br />
					and because it was pleasing to us<br />
					and approved<br />
					we are delighted.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir, whatever it was we questioned the Lord about,<br />
					that very thing the Lord explained,<br />
					and because it was pleasing to us<br />
					and approved<br />
					we are delighted.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, if it please you, revered sir,<br />
					we are going;<br />
					we are very busy<br />
					and there is much to be done."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You must do now, sire,<br />
					that for which you deem it the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					delighted at what the Lord had said,<br />
					having given thanks,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>
