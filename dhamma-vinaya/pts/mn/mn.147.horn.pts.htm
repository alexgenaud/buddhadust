					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in <span class="mozp">Anāthapiṇḍika's</span> monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as the Lord was in solitary meditation<br />
					a reasoning arose in his mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mature now in Rāhula<br />
					are the things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> that bring freedom to <a id="pg329"><span class="f2 g"><b>[329]</b></span></a> maturity.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to train Rahula further<br />
					in the destruction of the cankers?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And having dressed in the early morning<br />
					the Lord, taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked in Sāvatthī for almsfood,<br />
					on returning from the alms-gathering after the meal<br />
					he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Take your piece of cloth for sitting on,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Rāhula;<br />
					we will go to the Blind Men's Grove<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the day-sojoum."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					answered the venerable Rāhula<br />
					in assent to the Lord<br />
					and, taking his piece of cloth for sitting on,<br />
					he followed closely after the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					various thousands of <i>devas</i> were following the Lord,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today the Lord will train the venerable Rāhula further<br />
					in the destruction of the cankers."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord plunged into the Blind Men's Grove<br />
					and sat down on a seat made ready<br />
					at the root of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Rāhula,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Rahula<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Rāhula?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the eye permanent or impermanent?</p>
