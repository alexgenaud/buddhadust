<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 4. Brahman Janussoni questions the Buddha about the fears and distractedness of mind that arise on living alone in the wilderness. The Buddha explains that for those with corrupt behavior in body, speech and thought; with passionate desires, corrupt at heart, lazy, nervous, doubt-ridden, proud and arrogant, fearful, hungary for fame and gains, weak in energy, confused, without concentration, and weak in wisdom such a life does inspire fear, but for one without these corruptions such a life strengthens one in pursuit of the goal." />

While those of poor wisdom are talking, saliva drips from their mouths. It is called <i>lālā</i> and <i>eḷa</i>. Accordingly it is said: 'See the saliva-mouthed two-tongued snake' (reference to <i>Jā.</i> iii. 347, which should be inserted at <i>MA.</i> i. 118). Therefore they are called <i>eḷamugā. Eḷamūgā</i> is also a reading. Some also read <i>eḷamūkhā.</i> Further, there is also <i>eḷamukhā.</i> Everywhere the meaning is <i>eḷamukhā.</i>" It seems that <i>lālā,</i> saliva, is the real synonym. <i>Jā.</i> iii. 347 explains that <i>eḷamūgaɱ</i> is so called because <i>eḷa</i> trickles, or oozes, from the mouth. "To drivel" is given in the OED as "to let saliva or mucus flow from the mouth or nose, as infants and idiots do; to slaver. To flow ineptly from the lips."</p>
