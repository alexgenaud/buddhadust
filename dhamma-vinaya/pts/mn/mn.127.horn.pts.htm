					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the carpenter Fivetools<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> addressed a certain man,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, my good man,<br />
					approach the venerable Anuruddha;<br />
					having approached him,<br />
					in my name salute the venerable Anuruddha's feet with your head<br />
					and speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fivetools the carpenter, revered sir,<br />
					salutes the venerable Anuruddha's feet with his head<br />
					and speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir,<br />
					may the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and three others<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					consent to a meal with Fivetools the carpenter<br />
					on the morrow;<br />
					and, revered sir,<br />
					may the venerable Anuruddha arrive punctually<br />
					as Fivetools the carpenter is very busy<br />
					and has much to do<br />
					that is to be done for the king.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the man, having answered<br />
					"Yes, sir,"<br />
					in assent to Fivetools the carpenter,<br />
					approached the venerable Anuruddha;<br />
					having approached and greeted the venerable Anuruddha,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					this man spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Fivetools the carpenter<br />
					salutes the venerable Anuruddha's feet with his head<br />
					and speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir,<br />

					as Fivetools the carpenter is very busy<br />
					and has much to do<br />
					that is to be done for the king.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Anuruddha consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha,<br />
					towards the end of that night,<br />
					having dressed in the early morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe<br />
					approached the abode of Fivetools the carpenter;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Fivetools the carpenter<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served and satisfied the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					with sumptuous food,<br />
					solid and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the venerable Anuruddha had eaten<br />
					and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, <a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> Fivetools the carpenter,<br />
					taking a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Fivetools the carpenter was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br />
					monks who are elders,<br />
					have approached me and spoken thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Householder, develop boundless<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> freedom of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some elders spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Householder, develop widespread<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> freedom of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, as to boundless freedom of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householder,<br />

					it will become clear to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, it occurs to me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is boundless freedom of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">"Householder, as to that which is boundless freedom of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">These, householder, are four uprisings<br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, householder, someone,<br />
					thinking of limited light,<br />
					abides suffusing and pervading (it in meditation);<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					he arises in companionship<br />
					with the <i>devas</i> of limited Light.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, householder, someone,<br />
					thinking of boundless light<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					abides suffusing and pervading (it in meditation);<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />

					with the <i>devas</i> of boundless Light.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, householder, someone,<br />
					thinking of tarnished Light,<br />
					abides suffusing and pervading (it in meditation);<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					he arises in companionship<br />
					with the <i>devas</i> of tarnished Light.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, householder, someone,<br />
					thinking of pure light,<br />
					abides suffusing and pervading (it in meditation);<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					he arises in companionship<br />
					with the <i>devas</i> of pure Light.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, householder, are four uprisings<br />
					into a (new) becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a time, householder,<br />
					when those that are <i>devatās</i> gather together;<br />
					when they are gathered together<br />
					a difference in colour<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> can be seen<br />
					but not a difference in light.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as though, householder,<br />
					a man should take several oil-lamps into a house;<br />
					when they are being taken into the house<br />
					a difference in flame would be discernible<br />
					but not a difference in light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householder,<br />
					at the time when those that are <i>devatās</i> gather together;<br />
					when they are gathered together<br />
					a difference in colour can be seen<br />
					but not a difference in light.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a time, householder, when those that are <a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> <i>devatās</i> go away from there;<br />
					when they are going away from there<br />
					not only can a difference in colour be seen<br />
					but also a difference in light.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as though, householder,<br />
					a man should take out those several oil-lamps from that house;<br />
					when these are being taken out from there<br />
					not only would a difference in flame be discernible<br />
					but also a difference in light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householder,<br />
					there is a time when those that are <i>devatās</i> go away from there;<br />
					when they are going away from there<br />
					not only can a difference in colour be seen<br />
					but also a difference in light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, this does not occur to those <i>devatās</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is permanent<br />
					or steadfast<br />
					or eternal for us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, wherever it may be<br />
					that these <i>devatās</i> are dwelling<br />
					it is there that these <i>devatās</i> enjoy themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">As, householder, it does not occur to flies<br />
					as they are being borne along on a pingo<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> or basket:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is permanent<br />

					<p class="f4">and as, moreover, wherever it may be<br />
					that those flies are living<br />
					it is there that these flies enjoy themselves;</p>

					<p class="f4">in the same way, householder,<br />
					it does not occur to those <i>devatās</i>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is permanent<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccāna<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is good, revered Anuruddha,<br />
					but I have something further to ask on this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are those that are <i>devas</i> of Light, revered sir,<br />

					or are there some <i>devatās</i> of boundless Light?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"According to circumstances,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> reverend Kaccāna,<br />

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause, revered Anuruddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, reverend Kaccāna, on this matter<br />

					<p class="f4">It is as though, reverend Kaccāna,<br />

					and the wick is pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of the purity of the oil<br />
					and the purity of the wick,<br />
					(the lamp) does not burn but dimly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, reverend Kaccāna, some monk here,<br />

					<p class="f4">At the breaking up of the body after dying<br />

					with the <i>devas</i> of pure Light.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, reverend Kaccāna, is the cause,<br />
					this the reason<br />
					that, although these <i>devatās</i> have uprisen into a single class of <i>devatās</i>,<br />
					there are some <i>devatās</i> there<br />
					of tarnished Light,<br />
					and other <i>devatās</i> there<br />
					of pure Light."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccāna spoke thus to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is good, revered Anuruddha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg197"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span></a> Revered sir, the venerable Anuruddha did not speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus have I heard'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'It ought to be so.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary, revered sir,<br />
					the venerable Anuruddha merely said<br />
					that these <i>devatās</i> are such<br />
					and those <i>devatās</i> are thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, it occurs to me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Anuruddha<br />
					must certainly have lived previously<br />
					and talked previously<br />
					and held converse previously<br />
					with these <i>devatās.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This speech of yours, reverend Kaccāna,<br />
					comes close<br />
					and challenges me to a statement;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and I, moreover, will answer you.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time have I, reverend Kaccāna,<br />
					lived previously with these <i>devatās</i><br />
					and talked previously to them<br />
					and held converse previously with them."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Abhiya Kaccāna<br />
					spoke thus to Fivetools the carpenter:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a gain for you, householder,<br />
					it is well gotten by you, householder,<br />
					that you got rid of the doubt you had<br />
					and also obtained a chance<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> The verb <i>jhāyati</i> means both to burn and to meditate; but the former is from the Skrt. <i>kṣāyati</i> and the latter from <i>dhyāyati.</i> It seems however that <i>MA.</i> iv. 202 interprets <i>jhāyati</i> (the monk's "burning" or meditation) by <i>jalati,</i> to burn, to shine. This only shows that meditation, <i>jhāna,</i> is a state of mental incandescence, a burning up of what is to be got rid of, a consuming of it, so that the pure light can shine forth.</p>
