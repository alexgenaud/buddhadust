					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Saŋkhāra</i> is not here carrying any of its more usual senses, but has the meaning of purposeful intellection; see <i>P.E.D.</i> s.v. <i>saŋkhāra.</i> This is recognised at <i>MA.</i> iv. 146 which explains by <i>patthanā,</i> aiming at, wishing, aspiration. This is one thing while "the five things beginning with faith" are another. Both are necessary to assure the bourn, <i>gati</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>A.</i> iv, 239 for this sequence and for the following passage; but it enumerates fewer classes of devas than does this Discourse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Reading <i>vihārā</i> with <i>MA.</i> iv. 146 and one textual <i>v.l.</i> as against text's <i>vihāro</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>āmaṇḍa</i> (not in <i>P.E.D.</i>) explained by <i>āmalaka,</i> the usual word for emblic myrobalan, at <i>MA.</i> iv. 147. Childers and Monier-Williams give the castor-oil plant however for <i>āmaṇḍa.</i> In either case it seems likely that the seeds are being referred to rather than the plants themselves. Pali knows <i>eraṇḍa</i> (Skrt. also <i>eraṇḍa</i>) for castor-oil plant, <i>Ricinus communis.</i> Among the Indian vernacular names for this are <i>amanakkam</i> and <i>amadam,</i> George Watt, <i>Commercial Products of India,</i> London, 1908, p. 915.</p>

At <i>MA.</i> iv. 147 a <i>nikkha</i> is spoken of as worth five <i>suvaṇṇas,</i> and at <i>VvA.</i> 104 as fifteen <i>suvaṇṇas.</i> The value may have changed according to the locality.</p>
