					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:<br />
					"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks, the analysis of the undefiled.<br />
					Listen carefully to it, pay attention and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg278"><span class="f2 g"><b>[278]</b></span></a> "You should not be intent on the happiness of sense-pleasures<br />

					nor should you be intent on the practice of self-mortification<br />

					<p class="f4">When it is said:<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a>  When it is said:<br />
					'One should know how to judge what happiness is;<br />
					having known how to judge what happiness is,<br />
					one should be intent on inward happiness,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">These five, monks, are the strands of sense-pleasures.<br />
					What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shapes cognisable by the eye<br />
					agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with, sensual pleasure, alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognisable by the ear<br />
					agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with, sensual pleasure, alluring</p>

					<p class="f4">Smells cognisable by the nose<br />
					agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with, sensual pleasure, alluring</p>

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognisable by the tongue<br />
					agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with, sensual pleasure, alluring</p>

					<p class="f4">Touches cognisable by the body,<br />
					agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with, sensual pleasure, alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever happiness or joy, monks,<br />
					arises in consequence of these five strands of sense-pleasures<br />
					is said to be a happiness of sense-pleasures,<br />
					a vile happiness,<br />
					the happiness of an average person,<br />
					an unAriyan happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say of this happiness<br />
					that it is not to be pursued,<br />
					developed or made much of<br />
					— it is to be feared.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks, a monk,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters on and abides in the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, your reverences, a monk,<br />
					by allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters into and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, your reverences, a monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture<br />
					abides with equanimity,<br />
					mindful and clearly conscious<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the Ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					entering into the third meditation,<br />
					he abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, your reverences, a monk,<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					entering into<br />
					abides in the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is said to be the happiness of renunciation,<br />
					the happiness of aloofness,<br />
					the happiness of tranquillity,<br />
					the happiness of self-awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say of this happiness<br />
					that it is to be pursued,<br />
					developed and made much of<br />
					— it is not to be feared.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is said:<br />
					'One should know how to judge what happiness is;<br />
					having known how to judge what happiness is,<br />
					one should be intent on inward happiness,'<br />
					it is said in reference to this.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is said:<br />
					'One should not utter a secret speech;<br />
					face-to-face (with a man)<br />
					one should not tell (him) a vexatious thing,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />
					knowing a secret speech is not fact, untrue,<br />
					not connected with the goal,<br />
					one should not, if possible,<br />
					utter that secret speech;<br />
					and if, knowing that secret speech is fact,<br />
					true,<br />
					but not connected with the goal,<br />
					he should train himself not to speak it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if one knows that secret speech is fact, true,<br />
					and connected with the goal,<br />
					then he will know the right time to speak<br />
					that secret speech<br />
					to that (other person).</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />

					the body tires<br />
					and thought suffers<br />
					and the sound suffers<br />
					and the throat is affected;<br />
					the speech of one in a hurry<br />
					is not clear or comprehensible.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />
					if one speak slowly<br />
					the body does not tire<br />
					and thought does not suffer<br />
					and the sound does not suffer<br />

					the speech of one not in a hurry<br />
					is clear and comprehensible.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is said:<br />

					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks,<br />

					Pāti<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> ... Patta ... Vittha ... Sarāva ... Dhāropa ... Poṇa ... Pisīla.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus as they know the word as this or that<br />
					in these various districts<br />
					so does a person,<br />
					obstinately clinging to it<br />
					and adhering to it, explain:<br />
					'This indeed is the truth,<br />
					all else is falsehood.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is affectation of the dialect of the countryside<br />
					and departure from recognised parlance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is non-affectation of the dialect of the countryside<br />
					and nondeparture from recognised parlance?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />
					in different districts they know (the different words):<br />
					Pāti ... Patta ... Vittha ... Sarāva ... Dhāropa ... Poṇa ... Pisīla,<br />
					yet although they know the word as this or that<br />
					in these various districts<br />
					a person does not cling to it but explains:<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Araṇa</i> might also be translated as peace and <i>saraṇa</i> as disturbance: the peace that comes from absence of the defilements and the disturbance due to their presence. At <i>MA.</i> v. 32 it is said that <i>Araṇa</i> means free from passion or the defilements, <i>kilesa; cf. AA.</i> i. 220, <i>SA.</i> i. 101, <i>nikkilesa.</i> At <i>Vbh.</i> 19 <i>f.</i> the <i>khandha</i> of feeling is twofold, <i>saraṇa</i> and <i>Araṇa</i>. Saraṇ = sa + raṇa, concomitant with war, stain or defilement. See <i>B.H.S.D.</i> under <i>Araṇa</i> and <i>raṇa</i>. At <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/01_ones/an01.188-295.pali.bd.htm#pg24"><i>A.</i> i. 24</a> <i>Subhūti</i> is chief of abiders in non-defilement or peace, referred to at <i>MA.</i> v. 31 f.
					</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> One should not defame, <i>i.e.</i> carry tales to another person.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> khīṇa, explained at <i>MA.</i> v. 30 as <i>ākiṇṇa,</i> confused, troubled, and as <i>kiliṭṭha,</i> soiled. It means that one should not say what is detrimental, annoying or improper.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> That is, as to its ripening and as to the defilements, MA. v. 31.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> That is, thirst, <i>taṇhā,</i> <i>MA.</i> v. 31 which also says that when Subhūti was teaching dhamma he was not interested in the differences among individuals but simply laid down, "This is a wrong course, this the right one."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>vibhava</i> here. It should perhaps read bhava as at the end of the next paragraph.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This and the following six words are all words for bowl."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> As this phrase is of fairly frequent occurrence in <i>M.</i> and I have throughout translated it thus, I leave it thus here. Here however it clearly means: This is the true word, every other word is false.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 32 points out that he was among the Etad Aggas on two counts; and that when he went for alms with Sāriputta, Sāriputta stood at the doors of the houses attaining <i>nirodha</i> (the final meditative stage) while Subhūti attained <i>mettajhāna,</i> the meditation on friendliness. <i>Cf.</i> <i>AA.</i> i. 220, <i>ThagA.</i> i. 20, <i>UdA.</i> 348. See also <i>B.H.S.D.</i> under <i>araṇa</i> where Edgerton very tentatively puts the question of whether <i>araṇa</i> was not originally an adjective with a fem. noun: <i>samāpatti</i> or <i>maitri,</i> Pall <i>mettā</i>.</p>
