					and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, your reverences, is called<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, your reverences, is called<br />
					the ariyan truth of the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverences, the matchless Wheel of <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					set rolling by the Tathāāgata,<br />
					the perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					in the deer-park at Isipatana<br />
					near Benares<br />
					cannot be rolled back<br />
					by a recluse or brahman<br />
					or deva<br />
					or Māra<br />
					or Brahmā<br />
					or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say,<br />
					it was a proclamation<br />
					a teaching,<br />
					laying down,<br />
					establishing,<br />
					opening up,<br />
					analysing,<br />
					and making plain<br />
					of these four ariyan truths."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said.</p>

At <i>Vin.</i> iv. 325 "should neither help," <i>n'eva anuggaṅheyya,</i> is defined to mean: "should neither herself help (her pupil) with the recitation, interrogation, exhortation and instruction." This therefore must be regarded as help with <i>Dhamma</i>. It also appears that when <i>anuggaṅhāti</i> is used in relation to the attitude of a more experienced member of the Order to a less experienced one, it carries a technical or semi-technical sense. See <i>P.T.C.</i> under <i>anuggaṅhāti</i> for further references.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>uttamattha,</i> <i>i.e.</i> arahantship. It seems that Sāriputta expends himself on newly ordained monks rather than on those he knows to be on the higher ways.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This is Sāriputta's aspect as <i>dhammasenāpati,</i> Captain or General of <i>Dhamma,</i> next to the Buddha in power to roll on the <i>Dhamma</i>-wheel.</p>
