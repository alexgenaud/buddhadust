					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, your reverences, is called<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, your reverences, is called<br />
					the ariyan truth of the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverences, the matchless Wheel of <i>dhamma</i><br />
					set rolling by the Tathāāgata,<br />
					the perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					in the deer-park at Isipatana<br />
					near Benares<br />
					cannot be rolled back<br />
					by a recluse or brahman<br />
					or deva<br />
					or Māra<br />
					or Brahmā<br />
					or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say,<br />
					it was a proclamation<br />
					a teaching,<br />
					laying down,<br />
					establishing,<br />
					opening up,<br />
					analysing,<br />
					and making plain<br />
					of these four ariyan truths."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the venerable Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the venerable Sāriputta had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>anuggāhakā.</i> At <i>S.</i> iii. 5, v. 162 Sāriputta alone is so spoken of; translated at <i>K.S.</i> as "patron." <i>SA.</i> ii. 256 instances two forms of help, <i>anuggaha,</i> help with material things and help with <i>dhamma</i>. At <i>Vin.</i> iv. 325 "should neither help," <i>n'eva anuggaŋheyya,</i> is defined to mean: "should neither herself help (her pupil) with the recitation, interrogation, exhortation and instruction." This therefore must be regarded as help with <i>dhamma</i>. It also appears that when <i>anuggaŋhāti</i> is used in relation to the attitude of a more experienced member of the Order to a less experienced one, it carries a technical or semi-technical sense. See <i>P.T.C.</i> under <i>anuggaŋhāti</i> for further references.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>uttamattha,</i> <i>i.e.</i> arahantship. It seems that Sāriputta expends himself on newly ordained monks rather than on those he knows to be on the higher ways.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This is Sāriputta's aspect as <i>dhammasenāpati,</i> Captain or General of <i>dhamma</i>, next to the Buddha in power to roll on the <i>dhamma</i>-wheel.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The remainder of this Discourse is found in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22"><i>Mahā Satipaṭṭhana Suttanta</i> (<i>D.</i> Sta. 22)</a> from <i>D.</i> ii. 305-313, <i>i.e.</i> to the end of the ariyan truth of the course leading to the stopping of anguish. The first portion of the <i>D's</i> <i>Mahā Satipaṭṭhana Suttanta</i> is found in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10"><i>M.</i> Sta. 10, the <i>Satipaṭṭhana Sutta.</i></a> See <i><i>M.L.S.</i></i> i, Intr., p. xiv. Also <i>cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 49 <i>f.</i>, <i>S.</i> ii. 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> into a womb.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>nibbatti,</i> not at <i>M.</i> i. 49.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>cetasikaṁ dukkhaṁ</i> is omitted, probably in error, in Chalmers' text, but occurs at <i>D.</i> ii. 306.</p>
