<meta name="description" content="I.B. Horner's translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 22. A wide-ranging very famous sutta that begins with a forceful teaching on the dangers of indulgence in sense pleasures. This sutta contains two famous similies: the similie of the snake illustrating how a wrong grasp of the Dhamma is like taking hold of a poisonous snake from the wrong end; and the simile of the raft illustrating how the Dhamma should be used to attain it's ends and then be let go. The sutta concludes with a thorough examination of the way 'not self' should be considered." />

					in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a pernicious view had arisen like this<br />
					in a monk named Ariṭṭha<br />
					who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"In so far as I understand <i>dhamma</i><br />

					<p class="f4">Several monks heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha,<br />

					having approached,<br />
					they spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha,<br />
					who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks,<br />
					anxious to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha<br />

					from that pernicious view,<br />
					questioned him,<br />

					<p class="f4">For, in many a figure, reverend Ariṭṭha,<br />

					and in following these<br />

					<p class="f4">Sense pleasures are said by the Lord<br />
					to be of little satisfaction,<br />

					<p class="f4">Sense pleasures are likened by the Lord<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet the monk Ariṭṭha<br />

					<p class="f4">Since these monks were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha<br />

					<p class="f4">While they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed a certain monk, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">"'The Lord is summoning you, Ariṭṭha.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Lord,"<br />

					<p class="f4">As the monk Ariṭṭha<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
