					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Rāhula,<br />
					<a id="pt421" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg421"><span class="f2">[421]</span></a> having also dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe<br />
					followed close after the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having looked round,<br />
					addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, Rāhula, is material shape,<br />
					past, future, present,<br />
					subjective or objective,<br />
					gross or subtle,<br />
					low or excellent,<br />
					distant or near,<br />
					all material shape<br />
					should be seen as it really is<br />
					by means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<br />
					this am I not,<br />
					this is not my self.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Only material shape, Lord,<br />

					and feeling, Rāhula,<br />
					and perception, Rāhula,<br />
					and the habitual tendencies, Rāhula,<br />
					and consciousness, Rāhula."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Rāhula thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who indeed today,<br />
					when he has been exhorted<br />
					with an exhortation face-to-face with the Lord,<br />
					could enter a village for almsfood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And turning back from there,<br />
					he sat down cross-legged<br />
					at the root of a tree,<br />
					holding his back erect<br />
					and arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					saw the venerable Rāhula sitting down cross-legged<br />
					at the root of the tree,<br />
					holding his back erect<br />
					and arousing mindfulness in front of him;<br />
					and seeing him,<br />
					he addressed the venerable Rāhula,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Develop the (mind-) development<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula,<br />

					is of great fruit, of great advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> Rāhula,<br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Rāhula spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, how<br />
					if mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					is developed and made much of<br />
