					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Rāhula, <a id="pt421" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg421"><span class="f2">[421]</span></a> having also dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe followed close after the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having looked round, addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, Rāhula, is material shape, past, future, present, subjective or objective, gross or subtle, low or excellent, distant or near,<br />
					all material shape should be seen as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom thus:<br />
					'This is not mine,<br />
					this am I not,<br />
					this is not my self.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Only material shape, Lord,<br />
					only material shape, Wellfarer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Material shape, Rāhula,<br />
					and feeling, Rāhula,<br />
					and perception, Rāhula,<br />
					and the habitual tendencies, Rāhula,<br />
					and consciousness, Rāhula."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Rāhula thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who indeed today, when he has been exhorted with an exhortation face-to-face with the Lord, could enter a village for almsfood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And turning back from there,<br />
					he sat down cross-legged at the root of a tree,<br />
					holding his back erect<br />
					and arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Rāhula sitting down cross-legged at the root of the tree, holding his back erect and arousing mindfulness in front of him;<br />
					and seeing him, he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Develop the (mind-) development<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> that is mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula,<br />
					if developed and made much of<br />
					is of great fruit, of great advantage."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> Rāhula, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening, approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached, having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.<br />
					As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Rāhula spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, how if mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing is developed and made much of is it of great fruit, of great advantage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Rāhula, is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, that is to say:<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of extension<br />
					and whatever is an external element of extension,<br />
					just these are the element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus:<br />
