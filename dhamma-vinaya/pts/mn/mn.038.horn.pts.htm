					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a pernicious view<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> like this<br />
					had accrued to the monk called Sāti, a fisherman's son<br />
					a fisherman's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord<br />
					it is that this consciousness itself runs on,<br />

					<p class="f4">Several monks heard:</p>

					it is that this consciousness itself runs on,<br />
					fares on,<br />
					not another.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the monk Sāti<br />
					a fisherman's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they spoke thus to the monk Sāti a fisherman's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as is said,<br />
					that a pernicious view like this<br />
					has accrued to you,<br />
					reverend Sāti?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord<br />

					<p class="f4">Then these monks,<br />
					anxious to dissuade the monk Sāti a fisherman's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do not, reverend Sāti, a fisherman's son speak thus,<br />
					do not misrepresent the Lord;<br />
					neither is misrepresentation of the Lord seemly,<br />
					nor would the Lord speak thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, reverend Sāti, a fisherman's son<br />

					<p class="f4">'Apart from condition<br />

					<p class="f4">But the monk Sāti a fisherman's son,<br />
					even although questioned,<br />
					cross-questioned<br />
					and pressed for his reasons by these monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Thus it is that I, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">And since these monks were not able to dissuade the monk Sāti a fisherman's son,<br />
					from that pernicious view,<br />
					they approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, a pernicious view like this<br />
					has accrued to the monk Sāti a fisherman's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">We heard, Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then we approached the monk Sāti<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so do I, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, anxious to dissuade the monk Sāti a fisherman's son,<br />
					from that <a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> pernicious view,<br />
					we questioned him,<br />
					cross-questioned him,<br />
					and pressed him for his reasons,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, reverend Sāti, a fisherman's son speak thus,<br />
					do not misrepresent the Lord;<br />
					neither is misrepresentation of the Lord seemly,<br />

					<p class="f4">For, reverend Sāti, a fisherman's son<br />

					<p class="f4">But the monk Sāti a fisherman's son,<br />

					obstinately holding to<br />

					<p class="f4">And since. Lord, we were not able to dissuade the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					from that pernicious view,<br />
					we are telling this matter to the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed a certain monk, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, do you, monk,<br />
					address the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son, in my name,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sāti, a fisherman's son the teacher is summoning you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," and this monk,<br />
					having answered the Lord in assent,<br />
					approached the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The teacher is summoning you, reverend Sāti."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					and the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son, having answered this monk in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pernicious">"Is</a> it true, as is said,<br />
					that a pernicious view like this<br />
					has accrued to you, Sāti:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord<br />
					it is that this consciousness itself runs on,<br />
					fares on,<br />
					not another'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so do I, Lord, understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this consciousness itself that runs on,<br />
					fares on,<br />
					not another."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is this consciousness, Sāti?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this, Lord, that speaks,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that feels,<br />
					that experiences now<br />
					here, now there,<br />
					the fruition of deeds<br />
					that are lovely<br />
					and that are depraved."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"But to whom, foolish man,<br />
					do you understand that <i>Dhamma</i> was taught by me thus?</p>

					<p class="f4">Foolish man,<br />
					has not consciousness generated by conditions<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					been spoken of in many a figure by me, <a id="pg314"><span class="f2 g"><b>[314]</b></span></a> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Apart from condition<br />
					there is no origination of consciousness'?</p>

					<p class="f4">But now you, foolish man,<br />
					not only misrepresent me<br />
					because of your own wrong grasp,<br />
					but you also injure<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> yourself<br />
					and give rise to much demerit<br />
					which, foolish man,<br />
					will be for your woe and sorrow<br />
					for a long time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Can this monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					have even a glimmering of this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How could this be, Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not so, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					sat down silent,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					his shoulders drooping,<br />
					his head bent,<br />
					brooding,<br />
					speechless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, understanding why the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					was silent,<br />
					ashamed,<br />
					his shoulders drooping,<br />
					his head bent,<br />
					brooding,<br />
					speechless,<br />
					spoke thus to the monk Sāti, a fisherman's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You, foolish man, will be known<br />
					through this pernicious view of your own,<br />
					for I will question the monks on it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, monks, understand that <i>Dhamma</i> was taught by me thus<br />
					so that this monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					because of his own wrong grasp<br />
					not only misrepresents me<br />
					but is also injuring himself<br />
					and giving rise to much demerit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">For in many a figure<br />
					has consciousness generated by conditions<br />
					been spoken of to us by the Lord,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Apart from condition<br />
					there is no origination of consciousness.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is good, monks,<br />
					it is good that you understand thus<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i> taught by me to you, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">For in many a figure<br />
					has consciousness generated by conditions<br />
					been spoken of by me to you, monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Apart from condition<br />
					there is no origination of consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But this monk Sāti, a fisherman's son,<br />
					because of his own wrong grasp,<br />
					not only misrepresents me,<br />
					but is also injuring himself<br />
					and giving rise to much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">This will be for this foolish man's woe and sorrow<br />
					for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because, monks,<br />
					an appropriate condition arises<br />
					that consciousness is known by this or that name:<br />
					if consciousness arises because of eye and material shapes,<br />
					it is known as visual consciousness;<br />
					if consciousness arises because of ear and sounds,<br />
					it is known as auditory consciousness;<br />
					if, consciousness arises because of nose and smells,<br />
					it is known as olfactory consciousness;<br />
					if consciousness arises because of tongue and tastes,<br />
					it is known as gustatory consciousness;<br />
					<a id="pg315"><span class="f2 g"><b>[315]</b></span></a> if consciousness arises because of body and touches,<br />
					it is known as tactile consciousness;<br />
					if consciousness arises because of mind and mental objects,<br />
					it is known as mental consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as a fire burns<br />
					because of this or that appropriate condition,<br />
					by that it is known:<br />
					if a fire burns because of sticks,<br />
					it is known as a stick-fire;<br />
					and if a fire burns because of chips,<br />
					it is known as a chip-fire;<br />
					and if a fire burns because of grass,<br />
					it is known as a grass-fire;<br />
					and if a fire burns because of cow-dung,<br />
					it is known as a cow-dung fire;<br />
					and if a fire burns because of chaff,<br />
					it is known as a chaff-fire;<br />
					and if a fire burns because of rubbish,<br />
					it is known as a rubbish-fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, when because of a condition appropriate to it<br />
					consciousness arises,<br />
					it is known by this or that name:<br />
					if consciousness arises because of eye and material shapes,<br />
					it is known as visual consciousness;<br />
					if consciousness arises because of ear and sounds,<br />
					it is known as auditory consciousness;<br />
					if, consciousness arises because of nose and smells,<br />

					if consciousness arises because of body and touches,<br />
					it is known as tactile consciousness;<br />
					if consciousness arises because of mind and mental objects,<br />
					it is known as mental consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you see, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"From doubt, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"From doubt, monks, the perplexity arises:</p>
