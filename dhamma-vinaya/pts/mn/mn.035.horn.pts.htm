					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Great Grove in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time,<br />
					staying at Vesālī<br />
					was Saccaka, the son of Jains,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a controversialist,<br />
					giving himself out as learned,<br />
					much honoured by the manyfolk.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As he was going about Vesālī,<br />
					he used to utter this speech:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not see that recluse or brahman,<br />
					the head of a company,<br />
					the head of a group,<br />
					the teacher of a group,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even if he is claiming to be a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened one,<br />
					who, when taken in hand by me,<br />
					speech by speech,<br />
					would not tremble,<br />
					would not shake,<br />
					would not shake violently,<br />
					and from whose armpits<br />
					sweat would not pour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if I were to take in hand,<br />
					speech by speech,<br />
					an insensate post,<br />
					even that,<br />
					when taken in hand by me,<br />
					speech by speech,<br />
					would tremble,<br />
					would shake,<br />
					would shake violently -<br />
					let alone a human being."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/assaji.htm">Assaji,</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Vesālī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					who was always pacing up and down,<br />
					always roaming about on foot,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saw the venerable Assaji coming in the distance;<br />
					having seen him,<br />
					he approached the venerable Assaji;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Assaji,<br />
					and having exchanged greetings of courtesy and friendliness,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Assaji:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, good Assaji,<br />
					does the recluse Gotama train disciples?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the divisions<br />
					by which a great part of the recluse Gotama's instruction for disciples proceeds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Aggivessana,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					does the Lord train disciples,<br />
					and by such <a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a> divisions<br />
					does a great part of the Lord's instruction for disciples proceed:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Material shape, monks, is impermanent,<br />
					feeling is impermanent,<br />
					perception is impermanent,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are impermanent,<br />
					consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shape, monks, is not self,<br />
					feeling is not self,<br />
					perception is not self,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are not self,<br />
					consciousness is not self;</p>

					<p class="f4">all conditioned things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> are impermanent,</p>

					<p class="f4">all things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> are not self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Aggivessana, does the Lord train disciples,<br />
					and by such divisions<br />
					does the great part of the Lord's instruction for disciples proceed."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, we heard with disappointment,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> good Assaji,<br />
					those of us who heard<br />
					that the recluse Gotama spoke like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps we could meet the good Gotama somewhere,<br />
					sometime,<br />
					perhaps there might be some conversation,<br />
					perhaps we could dissuade him<br />
					from that pernicious view."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					at least five hundred Licchavis<br />
					were gathered together in the conference hall<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					approached those Licchavis;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to those Licchavis:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the good Licchavis come forward,<br />
					let the good Licchavis come forward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Today there will be conversation<br />
					between me and the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the recluse Gotama takes up his stand against me,<br />
					as one of his well known disciples,<br />
					the monk Assaji,<br />
					has taken up his stand against me,<br />
					even as<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> a powerful man,<br />
					having taken hold of the fleece<br />
					of a long-fleeced ram,<br />
					might tug it towards him,<br />
					might tug it backwards,<br />
					might tug it forwards and backwards,<br />
					even so will I,<br />
					speech by speech,<br />
					tug the recluse Gotama forwards,<br />
					tug him backwards,<br />
					tug him forwards and backwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">And even as a powerful distiller of spirituous liquor,<br />
					having sunk his crate for spirituous liquor<br />
					in a deep pool of water,<br />
					taking it by a corner<br />
					would tug it forwards,<br />
					would tug it backwards,<br />
					would tug it forwards and backwards,<br />
					even so will I,<br />
					speech by speech,<br />
					tug the recluse Gotama forwards,<br />
					tug him backwards,<br />
					tug him forwards and backwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">And even as a powerful drunkard of abandoned life,<br />
					having taken hold of a hair-sieve at the corner,<br />
					would shake it upwards,<br />
					would shake it downwards,<br />
					would toss it about,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even <a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> so will I,<br />
					speech by speech,<br />
					shake the recluse Gotama upwards,<br />
					shake him downwards,<br />
					toss him about.</p>

					<p class="f4">And even as a full-grown elephant,<br />
					sixty years old,<br />
					having plunged into a deep tank,<br />
					plays at the game called<br />
					the 'merry washing,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so, methinks,<br />
					will I play the game of 'merry washing'<br />
					with the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the good Licchavis come forward,<br />
					let the good Licchavis come forward;<br />
					today there will be conversation<br />
					between me and the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then some Licchavis spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How can the recluse Gotama<br />
					refute Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					when it is Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					who will refute the recluse Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Some Licchavis spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How can he, being only<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					refute the Lord<br />
					when it is the Lord<br />
					who will refute Saccaka, the son of Jains?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					surrounded by at least five hundred Licchavis,<br />
					approached the Great Wood,<br />
					and the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					several monks were pacing up and down in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains, approached these monks;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sirs, where is this revered Gotama staying now?</p>

					<p class="f4">We are anxious to see the revered Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Aggivessana,<br />
					this Lord,<br />
					having plunged into the Great Wood,<br />
					is sitting down for the day-sojourn<br />
					at the root of a tree."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					together with a great company of Licchavis,<br />
					having plunged into the Great Wood,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And these Licchavis too -<br />
					some having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;</p>

					<p class="f4">some <a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> exchanged greetings with the Lord,<br />
					and having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance;</p>

					<p class="f4">some, having saluted the Lord with outstretched palms,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;</p>

					<p class="f4">some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;</p>

					<p class="f4">some, having become silent,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Saccaka, the son of Jains, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would ask the revered Gotama about a point<br />
					if the revered Gotama grants me permission<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> to ask a question."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Ask, Āggivessana, whatever you like."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How does the good Gotama train disciples?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the divisions<br />
					by which a great part of the good Gotama's instructions for disciples proceeds?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus do I, Āggivessana, train disciples,<br />
					and by such divisions<br />
					does the great part of my instruction for disciples proceed:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Material shape, monks, is impermanent,<br />
					feeling is impermanent,<br />
					perception is impermanent,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are impermanent,<br />
					consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shape, monks, is not self,<br />
					feeling is not self,<br />
					perception is not self,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are not self,<br />
					consciousness is not self;</p>

					<p class="f4">all conditioned things are impermanent,</p>

					<p class="f4">all things are not self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Āggivessana, do I train disciples,<br />
					and by such divisions<br />
					does the great part of my instruction for disciples proceed."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A simile occurs to me, good Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Speak it forth, Āggivessana," the Lord said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, as<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> all seed growths<br />
					and vegetable growths<br />
					come to growth,<br />
					increase<br />
					and maturity<br />
					because all depend on the earth<br />
					and are based on the earth,<br />
					and it is thus that these seed growths<br />
					and vegetable growths<br />
					come to growth,<br />
					increase<br />
					and maturity;</p>

					<p class="f4">as, good Gotama, all those strenuous occupations<br />
					that are carried on<br />
					depend on the earth<br />
					and are based on the earth,<br />
					and it is thus that these strenuous occupations are carried on;</p>

					<p class="f4">so, good Gotama, that person<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> whose self is material shape,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					because it is based on material shape,<br />
					begets either merit or demerit,<br />
					this person whose self is feeling,<br />
					because it is based on feeling,<br />
					begets either merit or demerit,<br />
					this person whose self is perception,<br />
					because it is based <a id="pg284"><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></a> on perception,<br />
					begets either merit or demerit,<br />
					this person whose self is the habitual tendencies,<br />
					because it is based on the habitual tendencies,<br />
					begets either merit or demerit,<br />
					this person whose self is consciousness,<br />
					because it is based on consciousness,<br />
					begets either merit or demerit."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can it be, Aggivessana,<br />
					that yon speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Material shape is my self,<br />
					feeling is my self,<br />
					perception is my self,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are my self,<br />
					consciousness is my self'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, good Gotama,<br />
					do speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shape is my self,<br />
					feeling is my self,<br />
					perception is my self,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are my self,<br />
					consciousness is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so does this great concourse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What has this great concourse to do with you, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Please do you, Aggivessana,<br />
					unravel just your own words."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, good Gotama, speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shape is my self,<br />
					feeling is my self,<br />
					perception is my self,<br />
					the habitual tendencies are my self,<br />
					consciousness is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Aggivessana,<br />
					I will question you in return about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may answer me as you please.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would a noble anointed king,<br />
					such as King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					or such as King Ajātasattu of Magadha,<br />
					the son of the lady of Videhā,<br />
					have power in his own territory<br />
					to put to death<br />
					one deserving to be put to death,<br />
					to plunder<br />
					one deserving to be plundered,<br />
					to banish<br />
					one deserving to be banished?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, a noble anointed king,<br />
					such as King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					or such as King Ajātasattu of Magadha,<br />
					the son of the lady of Videhā,<br />
					would have power in his own territory<br />
					to put to death<br />
					one deserving to be put to death,<br />
					to plunder<br />
					one deserving to be plundered,<br />
					to banish<br />
					one deserving to be banished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, good Gotama,<br />
					even among these companies and groups,<br />
					namely of the Vajjis and Mallas,<br />
					there exists the power in their own territories<br />
					to put to death<br />
					one deserving to be put to death,<br />
					to plunder<br />
					one deserving to be plundered,<br />
					to banish<br />
					one deserving to be banished.</p>

					<p class="f4">How much more then a noble anointed king,<br />
					such as King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					or such as King Ajātasattu of Magadha,<br />
					the son of the lady of Videhā?</p>

					<p class="f4">He would have the power, good Gotama,<br />
					and he deserves to have the power."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Material shape is my self,'<br />
					have you power over this material shape of yours<br />
					(and can say),</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my material shape be thus",</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my material shape be not thus"'?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg285"><span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span></a> When this had been said, Saccaka, the son of Jains, became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Lord spoke thus to Saccaka, the son of Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Material shape is my self,'<br />
					have you power over this material shape of yours<br />

					<p class="f4">"Let my material shape be thus",</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my material shape be not thus"'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Saccaka, the son of Jains, became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Saccaka, the son of Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Answer now, Aggivessana,<br />
					now is not the time for you to become silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever, Aggivessana,<br />
					on being asked a legitimate question<br />
					up to the third time<br />
					by the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					does not answer,<br />
					verily his skull splits into seven pieces."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the <i>yakkha</i> Thunderbolt-bearer,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					taking his iron thunderbolt<br />
					which was aglow,<br />
					ablaze,<br />
					on fire,<br />
					came to stand above the ground over Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If this Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					does not answer<br />
					when he is asked a legitimate question<br />
					up to the third time<br />
					by the Lord,<br />
					verily I will make his skull<br />
					split into seven pieces."</p>

					<p class="f4">And only the Lord saw this <i>yakkha</i> Thunderbolt-bearer,<br />
					and Saccaka, the son of Jains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					afraid,<br />
					agitated,<br />
					his hair standing on end,<br />
					seeking protection with the Lord,<br />
					seeking shelter with the Lord,<br />
					seeking refuge with the Lord,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the revered Gotama ask me,<br />
					I will answer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Aggivessana?</p>
