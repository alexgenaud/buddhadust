<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 126. The Buddha explains that it is not enough to have hopes, aspirations, yearnings for freedom from pain, one must behave in a way that brings pain to and end for that to happen. He provides four similes to illustrate this point: trying to get oil by pressing sand, trying to get milk by pulling a bull's horn, trying to get butter by churning water, and trying to light a fire with a wet sappy stick." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>āsañ ce pi karitvāā,</i> having made a longing, hope or expectation. The word asd occurs at e.g. <i>Vin.</i> i. 260.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> At times the one, at times the other, <i>MA.</i> iv. 199.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>muddhānam āhacca tiṭṭhati,</i> stands striking the head, or pressing it down, therefore above it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> As at <i>Vin.</i> i. 234.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> I follow the <i>v.l.</i> <i>me</i> instead of text's Bhagavato.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>ayoni h'esā.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> i. 203, ayonim patinissajja.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>matthena āviñjeyya.</i> In the simile of pulling the young cow by the horn we get <i>visāṇato āviñjeyya.</i> But the precise meaning of <i>āviñjati</i> in these similes is obscure. In this one it seems to mean to twirl, to churn. Matthena should perhaps read <i>matthakena,</i> top, summit. Or has some confusion with the verb <i>mathati,</i> to stir, crept in (<i>cf.</i> <i>abhimattheyya</i> in the next simile)? Or should the reading be <i>manthena,</i> with a churning-stick? I have adopted tentatively this last alternative as it makes here, and in the "favourable" simile below, the greater amount of sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 240.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This phrase, from "And if," missed out in the text, is needed both for the balance of these expectation clauses and for that of this favourable fire-simile with the unfavourable one, no less than for that of the construction of all the simile-paragraphs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> iii. 131 (two similes).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> This is a very curious ending to a Discourse, and seems little more than an absent-minded repetition of <i>M.</i> iii. 131.</p>
