					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Rules for dyeing by monks are given at <i>Vin.</i> i. 286.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Allowed at <i>Vin.</i> ii. 116 where regulations for the use of this <i>kaṭhina</i> are given. See <i>B.D.</i> v. 158 <i>ff.</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 103 here asks how the thera got his robes if he did not accept material from householders and did not cut out or sew robe-material; and it answers that he was well known in two towns and that the people made and dyed the robe-material for him and then hung it out. while he was bathing. He then clothed himself. So he got things as easily as did the thera Nigrodha from Asoka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> to a meal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 194-195 says that in the <i>Mahāsakuludāyi Sutta</i> (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77">M. Sta. 77,</a> <i>MA.</i> iii, 240) "amid the houses" means from the village post, but here it means from the <i>nimbodakapatanaṭṭhāna.</i> The thera simply went up to the doors of the houses with his almsbowl and the people filled this with foods of various flavours.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> At <i>Vin.</i> iv. 21 monks are prohibited to teach <i>dhamma</i> to women in more than five or six sentences. <i>MA.</i> iv. 195 says that the thera did not do this even though it was allowable, and although practically all the theras who depended on families did so.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Although it was allowable to go if asked by an ill nun (<i>Vin.</i> iv. 67, <i>Pāc.</i> 23), the thera did not do this.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Always women; defined at <i>Vin.</i> iv. 332.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>nismyaṁ detā;</i> rules for giving guidance are laid down at <i>Vin.</i> i. 60 <i>ff.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Procedure for bathing in a bathroom and using chunam is laid down at <i>Vin.</i> i. 47.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>gaddūhanamattaṁ,</i> explained at <i>MA.</i> iv. 195 and <i>SA.</i> ii. 224 as the time it would take to got one drop of milk by pulling a cow's teat. The word occurs at <i>S.</i> ii. 264 but in another connection. That the thera was free from illness is said to be due to the deeds of healing done by him under the former Buddhas, Padumuttara and Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>harītakīkhaṇḍa,</i> Monks allowed to eat the fruits of this tree when they were ill, <i>Vin.</i> i. 201. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Vin.</i> i. 206.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> When he was sleeping he therefore maintained the sitting posture (one of the <i>dhutaŋga</i> and called <i>nesajjika</i>), as the next also shows. Reclining boards allowed at <i>Vin.</i> ii. 175.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 31.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>Sāṇa.</i> <i>MA.</i>IV. 186, reading <i>saraṇa</i> ( = <i>sa + raṇa,</i> desire or fault), explains by <i>sa-kilesa.</i> <i>SA.</i>ii. 199 reads <i>sāṇno ti sakileso, sa-iṇo</i> (with a debt) <i>hutvā.</i> I think Bakkula means to point to the suddenness with which <i>aññā,</i> profound knowledge or gnosis, arises and thus wipes out the debt, to the past and to past <i>kamma.</i> He is now free of this, being an arahant. See <i>a-raṇa</i> in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p139"><i>M.</i> Sta. 139.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The gifts of those with faith; <i>cf.</i> <i>Dhp.</i> 308.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> He was therefore no longer just a thera; he was also an arahant: <i>na thero ahan arahā ti āha,</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 196.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 196 explains that though the thera (Bakkula) did not himself let go forth or ordain, he got this done by other monks.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> <i>ajja me parinibbānaṁ bhavissati.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> He did not want his body to be a burden to any other monk after his <i>parinibbāna</i> so he entered into the condition of heat, <i>tejodhātu;</i> a flame sprang from his body, and his skin, flesh and blood burnt like ghee and were destroyed, <i>MA.</i> iv. 196.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Also called <i>Bakkulatheracchariyabbhuta sutta</i> and <i>Bakkulassa acchariyabbhuta suttanta.</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 197 says <i>idaṁ pana suttaṁ dutiyasaṇgahe saŋgahītaṁ,</i> "this Discourse was included in the second collection (or recension)." It will be noted that there is no mention of the Buddha in this Discourse.</p>
