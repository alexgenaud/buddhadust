					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove<br />
					at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the novice<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Aciravata was staying in the Forest Hut.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then prince Jayasena,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who was always pacing up and down,<br />
					always roaming about on foot,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					approached the novice Aciravata;<br />
					having approached<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the novice Aciravata;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Prince Jayasena spoke thus<br />
					to the novice Aciravata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, good Aggivessana,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that if a monk is abiding here<br />
					diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					he may attain one-pointedness of mind."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"That is so, prince;<br />
					that is so, prince.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk abiding here<br />
					diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					may attain one-pointedness of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It were good<br />
					if the reverend Aggivessana<br />
					were to teach me <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					as he has heard it,<br />
					as he has mastered it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, prince,<br />
					am not able to teach you <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					as I have heard it,<br />
					as I have mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if I were to teach you <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					as I have heard it,<br />
					as I have mastered it,<br />
					and if you could not understand<br />
					the meaning of what I said,<br />
					that would be weariness to me,<br />
					that would be a vexation to me."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the reverend Aggivessana<br />
					teach me <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					as he has heard it,<br />
					as he has mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps I could understand the meaning<br />
					of what the good Aggivessana says."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If I were to teach you <i>Dhamma,</i> prince,<br />
					as I have heard it,<br />
					as I have mastered it,<br />
					and if you were to understand<br />
					the meaning of <a id="pg176"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span></a> what I say,<br />
					that would be good;<br />
					if you should not understand<br />
					the meaning of what I say,<br />
					you must remain as you are:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					you must not question me further on the matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the reverend Aggivessana teach me <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					as he has heard it,<br />
					as he has mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I understand the meaning<br />
					of what the good Aggivessana says,<br />
					that will be good;<br />
					if I do not understand the meaning<br />
					of what the good Aggivessana says,<br />
					I will remain as I am;<br />
					I will not question the reverend<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> Aggivessana further<br />
					on this matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the novice Aciravata taught <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					to Prince Jayasena<br />
					as he had heard it,<br />
					as he had mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Prince Jayasena spoke thus<br />
					to the novice Aciravata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is impossible, good Aggivessana,<br />
					it cannot come to pass<br />
					that a monk abiding diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					should attain one-pointedness of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Jayasena,<br />
					having declared to the novice Aciravata<br />
					that this was impossible<br />
					and could not come to pass,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And soon after Prince Jayasena had departed,<br />
					the novice Aciravata<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached<br />
					and greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the novice Aciravata<br />
					told the Lord<br />
					the whole of the conversation<br />
					he had with Prince Jayasena<br />
					as far as it had gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the novice Aciravata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the good of that,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">That Prince Jayasena,<br />
					living as he does<br />
					in the midst of sense-pleasures,<br />
					enjoying sense-pleasures,<br />
					being consumed by thoughts of sense-pleasures,<br />
					burning with the fever of sense-pleasures,<br />
					eager in the search for sense-pleasures,<br />
					should know<br />
					or see<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or attain<br />
					or realize<br />
					that which can be known by renunciation,<br />
					seen by renunciation,<br />
					attained by renunciation,<br />
					realized by renunciation —<br />
					such a situation does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> Aggivessana,<br />
					among elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen to be tamed,<br />
					two elephants,<br />
					two horses<br />
					or two oxen<br />
					are well tamed,<br />
					well trained,<br />
					and two are not tamed,<br />
					not trained.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you <a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a> think about this, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would these two elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen<br />
					that were to be tamed<br />
					and that were well tamed,<br />
					well trained —<br />
					would these<br />
					on being tamed<br />
					reach tamed capacity,<br />
					would they,<br />
					being tamed,<br />
					attain a tamed stage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But those two elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen<br />
					that were to be tamed<br />
					but that were neither tamed nor trained —<br />
					would these,<br />
					not being tamed,<br />
					attain a tamed stage<br />
					as do the two elephants<br />
					or horses<br />
					or oxen to be tamed<br />
					that were well tamed,<br />
					well trained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Aggivessana,<br />
					that Prince Jayasena,<br />
					living as he does<br />
					in the midst of sense-pleasures,<br />
					enjoying sense-pleasures,<br />
					being consumed by thoughts of sense-pleasures,<br />
					burning with the fever of sense-pleasures,<br />
					eager in the search for sense-pleasures,<br />
					should know<br />
					or see<br />
					or attain<br />
					or realize<br />
					that which can be known by renunciation,<br />
					seen by renunciation,<br />
					attained by renunciation,<br />
					realized by renunciation —<br />
					such a situation does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, Aggivessana,<br />
					there were a great mountain slope<br />
					near a village<br />
					or a market-town<br />
					which two friends,<br />
					coming hand in hand<br />
					from that village<br />
					or market-town<br />
					might approach;<br />
					having approached the mountain slope<br />
					one friend might remain at the foot<br />
					while the other might climb to the top.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the friend<br />
					standing at the foot of the mountain slope<br />
					might speak thus<br />
					to the one standing on the top:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My dear,<br />
					what do you see<br />
					as you stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He might reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As I stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope<br />
					I, my dear,<br />
					see delightful parks,<br />
					delightful woods,<br />
					delightful stretches of level ground<br />
					delightful ponds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the other might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is impossible,<br />
					it cannot come to pass, my dear,<br />
					that, as you stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope,<br />
					you should see<br />
					delightful parks,<br />
					delightful woods,<br />
					delightful stretches of level ground<br />
					delightful ponds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the friend<br />
					who had been standing on top<br />
					of the mountain slope<br />
					having come down to the foot<br />
					and taken his friend by the arm,<br />
					making him climb to the top<br />
					of the mountain slope<br />
					and giving him a moment<br />
					in which to regain his breath,<br />
					might speak to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, my dear,<br />
					what is it that you see<br />
					as you stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, my dear,<br />
					as I stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope,<br />
					see<br />
					delightful parks,<br />
					delightful woods,<br />
					delightful stretches of level ground<br />
					delightful ponds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just now, my dear,<br />
					we understood you to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is impossible,<br />
					it cannot come to pass,<br />
					that, as you stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope,<br />
					you should see<br />
					delightful parks,<br />
					delightful woods,<br />
					delightful stretches of level ground<br />
					delightful ponds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But now we understand you to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, my dear,<br />
					as I stand on the top<br />
					of the mountain slope,<br />
					see<br />
					delightful parks,<br />
					delightful woods,<br />
					delightful stretches of level ground<br />
					delightful ponds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That was because I, my dear,<br />
					hemmed in by this great mountain slope,<br />
					could not see what was to be seen.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> "Even so<br />
					but to a still greater degree, Aggivessana,<br />
					is Prince Jayasena hemmed in,<br />
					blocked,<br />
					obstructed,<br />
					enveloped by this mass of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, that Prince Jayasena,<br />
					living as he does<br />
					in the midst of sense-pleasures,<br />
					enjoying sense-pleasures,<br />
					being consumed by thoughts of sense-pleasures,<br />
					burning with the fever of sense-pleasures,<br />
					eager in the search for sense-pleasures,<br />
					should know<br />
					or see<br />
					or attain<br />
					or realize<br />
					that which can be known by renunciation,<br />
					seen by renunciation,<br />
					attained by renunciation,<br />
					realized by renunciation —<br />
					such a situation does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had these two similes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> occurred to you, Aggivessana,<br />
					for Prince Jayasena,<br />
					Prince Jayasena naturally<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					would have acted in the manner<br />
					of one having trust in you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how could these two similes<br />
					for Prince Jayasena<br />
					have occurred to me, revered sir,<br />
					seeing that they are spontaneous,<br />
					that is to say to the Lord,<br />
					and have never been heard before?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"As, Aggivessana,<br />
					a noble anointed king<br />
					addresses an elephant hunter<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You, good elephant hunter,<br />
					mount the king's elephant<br />
					and go into an elephant forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you see a forest elephant,<br />
					tie him to the neck<br />
					of the king's elephant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Aggivessana,<br />
					the elephant hunter having answered:<br />
					'Yes, sire,'<br />
					in assent to the noble anointed king,<br />
					mounts the king's elephant<br />
					and goes into an elephant forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing a forest elephant,<br />
					he ties him to the neck<br />
					of the king's elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the king's elephant<br />
					brings him out into the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Aggivessana,<br />
					the forest elephant has this longing,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					for the elephant forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in regard to him<br />
					the elephant hunter<br />
					tells the noble anointed king<br />
					that the forest elephant<br />
					has got out into the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble anointed king<br />
					then addresses an elephant tamer,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, good elephant tamer,<br />
					tame the forest elephant<br />
					by subduing his forest ways,<br />
					by subduing his forest memories,<br />
					and aspirations<br />
					and by subduing his distress,<br />
					his fretting and fever for the forest,<br />
					by making him pleased<br />
					with the villages<br />
					and by accustoming him<br />
					to human ways.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And, Aggivessana, the elephant tamer,<br />
					having answered 'Yes, sire,'<br />
					in assent to the noble anointed king,<br />
					driving a great post into the ground<br />
					ties the forest elephant to it<br />
					by his neck<br />
					so as to subdue his forest ways,<br />
					by subduing his forest memories,<br />
					and aspirations<br />
					and by subduing his distress,<br />
					his fretting and fever for the forest,<br />
					by making him pleased<br />
					with the villages<br />
					and by accustoming him<br />
					to human ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the elephant tamer addresses him<br />
					with such words as are gentle,<br />
					pleasing <a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasant to the manyfolk,<br />
					liked by the manyfolk.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Aggivessana, the forest elephant,<br />
					on being addressed<br />
					with words that are gentle,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasant to the manyfolk,<br />
					liked by the manyfolk,<br />
					listens,<br />
					lends ear<br />
					and bends his mind to learning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next the elephant tamer<br />
					supplies him with grass-fodder<br />
					and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Aggivessana, the forest elephant<br />
					has accepted the grass-fodder and water<br />
					from the elephant tamer,<br />
					it occurs to the elephant tamer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The king's elephant will now live.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the elephant tamer<br />
					makes him do<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> a further task,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Take up,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> put down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Aggivessana the king's elephant<br />
					is obedient to the elephant tamer<br />
					and acts on his instructions<br />
					to take up and put down,<br />
					then the elephant tamer<br />
					makes him do a further task,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Get up, sit down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Aggivessana, the king's elephant<br />
					is obedient to the elephant tamer<br />
					and acts on his instructions<br />
					to get up and sit down,<br />
					then the elephant tamer<br />
					makes him do a further task;<br />
					known as 'standing your ground':<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he ties a shield<br />
					to the great beast's trunk;<br />
					a man holding a lance<br />
					is sitting on his neck,<br />
					and men holding lances<br />
					are standing surrounding him on all sides;<br />
					and the elephant tamer,<br />
					holding a lance with a long shaft,<br />
					is standing in front.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is doing the task<br />
					of 'standing your ground'<br />
					he does not move a fore-leg<br />
					nor does he move a hind-leg,<br />
					nor does he move the forepart of his body,<br />
					nor does he move the hindpart of his body,<br />
					nor does he move his head,<br />
					nor does he move an ear,<br />
					nor does he move a tusk,<br />
					nor does he move his tail,<br />
					nor does he move his trunk.</p>

					<p class="f4">A king's elephant<br />
					is one who endures<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> blows<br />
					of sword,<br />
					axe,<br />
					arrow,<br />
					hatchet,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the resounding din<br />
					of drum and kettle-drum,<br />
					conch and tam-tam,<br />
					he is [like] purified gold<br />
					purged of all its dross and impurities,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					fit for a king,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a royal possession<br />
					and reckoned as a kingly attribute.</p>

					<h4>Acquisition of faith</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Aggivessana,<br />
					does a Tathāgata arise here in the <a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> world,<br />
					a perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with right knowledge and conduct,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer<br />
					of men to be tamed,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world<br />
					with the <i>devas,</i><br />
					with Mara,<br />
					with Brahma,<br />
					the creation<br />
					with its recluses and brahmans,<br />
					its <i>devas</i> and men,<br />
					having realized them<br />
					by his own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					which is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the ending,<br />
					with the spirit and the letters;<br />
					he proclaims the Brahma-faring,<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					quite purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder<br />
					or a householder's son<br />
					or one born in another family<br />
					hears that <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard that <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					he gains faith in the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with this faith<br />
					that he has acquired,<br />
					he reflects in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The household life<br />
					is confined and dusty,<br />
					going forth is in the open;<br />
					it is not easy for one who lives in a house<br />
					to fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					wholly pure,<br />
					polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having put on saffron robes,<br />
					should go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness?'</p>

					<p class="f4">After a time,<br />
					getting rid of his wealth,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					getting rid of his circle of relations,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					having cut off his hair and beard,<br />
					having put on saffron robes,<br />
					he goes forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">To this extent, Aggivessana,<br />
					the ariyan disciple<br />
					gets out into the open.</p>

					<h4>Morality</h4>

					<p class="f4">"But, Aggivessana, <i>devas</i> and mankind<br />
					have this longing,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					for the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					be moral,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span><br />
					live controlled by the control of the Obligations,<br />
					possessed of [right] behavior and posture,<br />
					seeing danger in the slightest faults;<br />
					undertaking them,<br />

					<h4>Moderation in eating</h4>

					<p class="f4">"And when, Aggivessana,<br />
					the ariyan disciple is guarded<br />

					then the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Thus will I crush out an old feeling,<br />

					<h4>Vigilance</h4>

					<p class="f4">"When, Aggivessana,<br />

					<h4>Mindfulness and clear consciousness</h4>

					<p class="f4">"And when, Aggivessana,<br />

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />

					<h4>Overcoming of the five hindrances</h4>

					<p class="f4">"And when, Aggivessana,<br />
					the ariyan disciple is possessed<br />

					then the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					choose a remote lodging<br />

					<p class="f4">On returning from alms-gathering<br />

					<p class="f4">He, getting rid of covetousness for the world,<br />
					dwells with a mind<br />

					of covetousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of the taint of ill-will,<br />
					he dwells benevolent in mind;<br />
					compassionate and merciful<br />
					towards all creatures and beings,<br />
					he cleanses the mind<br />
					of ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of sloth and torpor,<br />
					he dwells without sloth or torpor;<br />
					perceiving the light,<br />
					mindful and clearly conscious<br />

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of doubt,<br />
					he dwells doubt-crossed;<br />
					unperplexed as to the states that are skilled,<br />
					he cleanses his mind<br />
					of doubt.</p>

					<h4>The four applications of mindfulness</h4>

					<p class="f4">"He,<br />
					by getting rid of these five hindrances<br />
					which are defilements of the mind<br />
					and weakening to intuitive wisdom,<br />
					dwells contemplating the body in the body,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					clearly <a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> conscious [of it],<br />

					mindful<br />
					so as to control<br />

					<p class="f4">He fares along contemplating the mind in the mind,<br />

					so as to control<br />
					the covetousness and dejection in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He fares along contemplating the mental states in mental states,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					clearly conscious,<br />
					mindful<br />
					so as to control<br />
					the covetousness and dejection in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"As, Aggivessana,<br />
					an elephant tamer,<br />
					driving a great post into the ground,<br />
					ties a forest elephant to it<br />
					by his neck<br />
					so as to subdue his forest ways,<br />
					so as to subdue his forest aspirations,<br />
					and so as to subdue his distress,<br />
					his fretting and fever for the forest,<br />
					so as to make him pleased with villages<br />
					and accustom him to human ways —<br />
					even so, Aggivessana,<br />
					these four applications of mindfulness<br />
					are ties of the mind<br />
					so as to subdue the ways of householders<br />
					and to subdue the aspirations of householders<br />
					and to subdue the distress,<br />
					the fretting and fever of householders;<br />
					they are for leading to the right path,<br />
					for realizing nibbana.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata then disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					fare along contemplating the body in the body,<br />
					but do not apply yourself<br />
					to a train of thought<br />
					connected with the body;</p>

					<p class="f4">fare along contemplating the feelings in the feelings,<br />

					<p class="f4">fare along contemplating the mind in the mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">fare along contemplating mental states in mental states,<br />
					but do not apply yourself<br />
					to a train of thought<br />

					<h4>Jhana</h4>

					<p class="f4">"He by allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquilized<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters on and abides in the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquilized<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					he enters and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous<br />
					and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br />
					he dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy<br />
					of which the ariyans say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Joyful lives he<br />
					who has equanimity<br />
					and is mindful,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down<br />
					of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					he enters and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity<br />
					and mindfulness.</p>

					<h4>The three knowledges</h4>

					<h5>1. Recollection of former habitations</h5>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs hi mind<br />
					to the knowledge and recollection<br />
					of former habitations:</p>

					<p class="f4">He remembers a variety of former habitations, thus:<br />
					one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he remembers divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.</p>

					<h5>2. The Divine Eye</h5>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the passing hence<br />
					and the arising of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					he sees beings as they pass hence<br />
					or come to be;<br />
					he comprehends that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds,<br />
					and he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in speech,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					does he see beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					he comprehends that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds.</p>

					<h5>3. Destruction of Cankers: Sainthood</h5>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is anguish,<br />
					this is the arising of anguish,<br />
					this is the stopping of anguish,<br />
					this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the cankers,<br />
					this is the arising of the cankers,<br />
					this is the stopping of the cankers,<br />
					this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing this thus,<br />
					seeing thus,<br />
					his mind is freed<br />
					from the canker of sense-pleasures,<br />
					and his mind is freed<br />
					from the canker of becoming,<br />
					and his mind is freed<br />
					from the canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom<br />
					the knowledge comes to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am freed';</p>

					<p class="f4">and he comprehends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or such.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"That monk is able to endure heat,<br />
					cold,<br />
					hunger,<br />
					thirst,<br />
					the touch of mosquitoes,<br />
					gadflies,<br />
					wind,<br />
					sun<br />
					and creeping things,<br />
					abusive language<br />
					and unwelcome modes of speech:<br />
					he has grown to bear bodily feelings<br />
					which as they arise<br />
					are painful,<br />
					acute,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe,<br />
					wretched,<br />
					miserable,<br />
					deadly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purged of all the dross and impurities<br />
					of attachment,<br />
					aversion<br />
					and confusion,<br />
					he is worthy of oblations,<br />
					offerings,<br />
					respect<br />
					and homage,<br />
					an unsurpassed field of merit in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Aggivessana,<br />
					a king's elephant dies in old age,<br />

					untrained,<br />
					the king's old elephant<br />
