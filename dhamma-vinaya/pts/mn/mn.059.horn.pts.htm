					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Five-tools,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the carpenter,<br />
					approached the venerable Udāyin<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the venerable Udāyin,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Fivetools, the carpenter, spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Udāyin:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg65"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></a> "Now, revered Udāyin,<br />
					how many feelings are spoken of by the Lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Three, householder,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are the feelings<br />
					that are spoken of by the Lord:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling,<br />
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, householder,<br />
					are the three feelings<br />
					spoken of by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered Udāyin,<br />
					three feelings are not spoken of by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Two feelings are spoken of by the Lord:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, that feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					that is spoken of by the Lord<br />
					as belonging to exquisite happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Udāyin<br />
					spoke thus to Fivetools, the carpenter:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Three, householder,<br />
					are the feelings<br />
					that are spoken of by the Lord:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling,<br />
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, householder,<br />
					are the three feelings<br />
					spoken of by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Fivetools the carpenter spoke thus to the venerable Udāyin:</p>

					<p class="f4">Two feelings are spoken of by the Lord:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, that feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					that is spoken of by the Lord<br />
					as belonging to exquisite happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the venerable Udāyin<br />
					spoke thus to Fivetools, the carpenter:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Three, householder,<br />
					are the feelings<br />
					that are spoken of by the Lord:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling,<br />
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, householder,<br />
					are the three feelings<br />
					spoken of by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Fivetools the carpenter spoke thus to the venerable Udāyin:</p>

					<p class="f4">Two feelings are spoken of by the Lord:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, that feeling which is neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					that is spoken of by the Lord<br />
					as belonging to exquisite happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">So neither was the venerable Udāyin<br />
					able to convince Fivetools the carpenter,<br />
					nor was Fivetools the carpenter<br />
					able to convince the venerable Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, the venerable Ānanda overheard this conversation<br />
					between the venerable Udāyin<br />
					and Fivetools the carpenter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda told the Lord<br />
					the whole of the conversation<br />
					between the venerable Udāyin<br />
					and Fivetools the <a id="pg66"><span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span></a> carpenter as far as it went.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Although, Ānanda, Udāyin's classification<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> was right,<br />
					Fivetools the carpenter disagreed;<br />
					and although Fivetools the carpenters classification was right,<br />
					Udāyin disagreed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, two feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me<br />
					according to (one) classification,<br />
					and three feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me<br />
					according to (one) classification,<br />
					and five feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me<br />
					according to (one) classification,<br />
					and six feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me<br />
					according to (one) classification,<br />
					and eighteen feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me<br />
					according to (one) classification,<br />
					and thirty-six feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me<br />
					according to (one) classification,<br />
					and one hundred and eight feelings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> are spoken of by me according to (one) classification.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, is dhamma taught by me<br />
					according to classification.</p>

					<p class="f4">As dhamma, is taught by me thus, Ānanda,<br />
					according to classification,<br />
					of those who will not accede to,<br />
					approve of<br />
					or accept<br />
					what has been well said,<br />
					well spoken by each other,<br />
					this is to be expected:<br />
					that they will live wrangling,<br />
					quarrelsome,<br />
					disputatious,<br />
					wounding one another<br />
					with the weapons of the tongue.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, is dhamma taught by me<br />
					according to classification.</p>

					<p class="f4">As dhamma is taught by me thus, Ānanda,<br />
					according to classification,<br />
					of those who will accede to,<br />
					approve of<br />
					and accept<br />
					what has been well said,<br />
					well spoken by each other,<br />
					this is to be expected:<br />
					that they will live<br />
					all together on friendly terms<br />
					and harmonious as milk and water blend,<br />
					regarding one another with the eye of affection.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, there are these five strands of sense-pleasures.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shapes cognisable by the eye,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognisable by the ear,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smells cognisable by the nose <a id="pg67"><span class="f2 g"><b>[67]</b></span></a>,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognisable by the tongue,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touches cognisable by the body,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Ānanda, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever happiness,<br />
					whatever joy, Ānanda,<br />
					arises in consequence<br />
					of these five strands of sense-pleasures,<br />
					it is called<br />
					happiness in sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever, Ānanda, should speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the highest happiness and joy<br />
					that creatures experience' -<br />
					this I cannot allow on his part.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Ānanda, another happiness<br />
					more excellent and exquisite<br />
					than that happiness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda, is this other happiness<br />
					more excellent and exquisite<br />
					than that happiness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters and abides in<br />
					the first meditation<br />
					that is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the other happiness<br />
					that is more excellent and exquisite<br />
					than that happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever, Ānanda, should speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind inwardly tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the other happiness<br />
					that is more excellent and exquisite<br />

					<p class="f4">Whoever, Ānanda, should speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda, is this other happiness<br />
					more excellent and exquisite<br />
					than that happiness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and he enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the other happiness<br />
					that is more excellent and exquisite<br />
					than that happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever, Ānanda, should speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by getting rid of happiness<br />
					and <a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the other happiness<br />
					that is more excellent and exquisite<br />

					<p class="f4">But the situation occurs, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama speaks of the stopping of perceiving and feeling,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now what is this,<br />
					now how is this?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, wanderers belonging to other sects<br />
					who speak thus<br />
					should be spoken to thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverences, the Lord does not lay down that it is only pleasant feeling<br />
					that belongs to happiness;<br />
					for, your reverences, the Tathāgata lays down<br />
					that whenever,<br />
					wherever,<br />
					whatever<br />
					happiness is found<br />
					it belongs to happiness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
