					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman Brahmāyu was living in Mithilā.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was worn,<br />
					old,<br />
					full of years,<br />
					he had lived his span<br />
					and was at the close of his life,<br />
					a hundred and twenty years of age;<br />
					he was master<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of the three Vedas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					a grammarian,<br />

					and the marks of a Great Man.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Brahmāyu heard:</p>

					son of the Sakyans,<br />

					together with a large Order of monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">The most lovely report has gone abroad thus<br />

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />

					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br />

					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <a id="pg318"><span class="f2 g"><b>[318]</b></span></a> <i>Dhamma</i><br />

					lovely in the middle<br />

					he explains with the spirit and the letter<br />
					the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled<br />
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br />
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the brahman Brahmāyu had the brahman youth Uttara as pupil;<br />
					he was master of the three Vedas,<br />
					versed in the vocabularies and rituals<br />
					together with the phonology and exegesis<br />
					and the legendary tradition as the fifth;<br />
					he was learned in idioms,<br />
					a grammarian,<br />
					proficient in popular philosophy<br />
					and the marks of a Great Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Brahmāyu<br />
					addressed the brahman youth Uttara,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dear Uttara, this recluse Gotama,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					having gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />

					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					with as many as five hundred monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">The most lovely report has gone abroad thus<br />
					concerning this revered Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br />

					together with recluses and brahmans,<br />
					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that is lovely at the beginning,<br />

					completely fulfilled<br />
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br />
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Come you, dear Uttara,<br />
					approach the recluse Gotama;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					find out whether the recluse Gotama is in fact<br />
					that revered Gotama of whom the report has gone abroad<br />
					or whether he is not,<br />
					and whether the revered Gotama is such a one<br />
					or not such a one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through you<br />
					will we know that revered Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will I,<br />
					in virtue of what you say,<br />
					find out whether that revered Gotama is in fact<br />
					the revered Gotama of whom the report has gone abroad<br />
					or whether he is not,<br />
					and whether the revered Gotama<br />
					is such a one<br />
					or not such a one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dear Uttara, in our <i>mantras</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the thirty-two marks of the Great Man are traditional.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For a Great Man<br />
					possessed of these<br />
					only two courses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> are open,<br />
					not another:<br />
					If he settles in the household state<br />
					he becomes a king<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> who is a wheel-turner,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the ruler of the whole world,<br />
					one who <a id="pg319"><span class="f2 g"><b>[319]</b></span></a> brings stability to his realm;<br />
					and he is possessed of the seven Treasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven Treasures of his are<br />
					the wheel-treasure,<br />
					the elephant-treasure,<br />
					the horse-treasure,<br />
					the jewel-treasure,<br />
					the woman-treasure,<br />
					the householder-treasure,<br />
					the adviser-treasure as the seventh.</p>

					<p class="f4">He will have more than a thousand sons,<br />
					valiant,<br />
					built on heroic lines,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					able to crush opposing armies.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells conquering this sea-girt land<br />
					by <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					not by stick,<br />
					not by sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if he goes forth from home<br />
					into homelessness<br />
					he becomes a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					a lifter of the world's veil.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now I, dear Uttara,<br />
					am an imparter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> of <i>mantras</i>,<br />
					you are a recipient<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> of <i>mantras</i>."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, sir,"<br />
					and the brahman youth Uttara,<br />
					having answered the brahman Brahmāyu in assent,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the brahman Brahmāyu,<br />
					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					set out on tour (to find) the Lord in Videha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking on tour,<br />
					he gradually approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the brahman youth Uttara<br />
					looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					on the Lord's body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the brahman youth Uttara<br />
					saw all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					on the Lord's body<br />
					except two.</p>

					<p class="f4">About these two marks of a great man<br />
					he was in doubt,<br />
					perplexed,<br />
					uncertain,<br />
					not satisfied -<br />
					whether what was cloth-hid was sheath-cased<br />
					and whether the tongue was large.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This brahman youth Uttara sees on me<br />
					all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					except two.</p>

					<p class="f4">About these two marks of a Great Man<br />
					he is in doubt,<br />
					perplexed,<br />
					uncertain,<br />
					not satisfied:<br />
					whether what is cloth-hid is sheath-cased<br />
					<a id="pg320"><span class="f2 g"><b>[320]</b></span></a> and whether my tongue is large."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord contrived such a contrivance of psychic power<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that the brahman youth Uttara saw<br />
					that that which the Lord had cloth-hid was sheath-cased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having put out his tongue,<br />
					stroked it backwards and forwards<br />
					over both his ears<br />
					and he stroked it backwards and forwards<br />
					over both his nostrils<br />
					and he covered the whole dome of his forehead<br />
					with his tongue.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahman youth Uttara:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to follow the recluse Gotama closely<br />
					so as to watch his conduct?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for seven months the brahman youth Uttara,<br />
					like a constant shadow,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span><br />
					followed the Lord closely.</p>

					<p class="f4">After the lapse of the seven months<br />
					the brahman youth Uttara set out on tour for Mithilā in Videha;<br />
					walking on tour<br />
					he gradually approached Mithilā<br />
					and the brahman Brahmāyu;<br />
					having approached<br />
					and having greeted the brahman Brahmāyu,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmāyu the brahman spoke thus to the brahman youth Uttara<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I suppose, dear Uttara,<br />
					that the report spread abroad about the revered Gotama<br />
					was truly so<br />
					and not otherwise?</p>

					<p class="f4">I suppose that the revered Gotama<br />
					is such a one<br />
					and not of another kind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the report spread abroad about the revered Gotama<br />
					was truly so<br />
					and not otherwise;<br />
					this revered Gotama is such a one<br />
					and not of another kind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this revered Gotama is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmans and householders of Mithilā<br />

					<p class="f4">The brahman Brahmāyu heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmāyu the brahman approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Brahmāyu the brahman looked for<br />

					<p class="f4">About these two marks of a Great Man<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmāyu the brahman addressed the Lord in verses:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord contrived such a contrivance of psychic power<br />

					that that which the Lord had cloth-hid was sheath-cased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having put out his tongue,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahman Brahmāyu:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Permission has been given me by the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to ask the recluse Gotama<br />

					<p class="f4">But then it occurred to the brahman Brahmāyu:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I myself am skilled in the goals of the here and now,<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to ask the recluse Gotama<br />
					simply about the goal of a future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmāyu the brahman addressed the Lord in verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"How is one a brahman? How does one become master of knowledge?<br />
							How is one a threefold knowledge-man? Who is called learned?<br />
							How is one perfected? How does one become whole?<br />
							And how is one a sage? Who is called Awake?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord responded in verses<br />

					with his mouth<br />
					and stroked them on all sides<br />
					with his hands,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, good Gotama, am Brahmāyu, the brahman."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that company was filled with wonder and marvel,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed it is wonderful,<br />
					indeed it is marvellous<br />
					how great is the psychic power<br />
					and the majesty<br />
					of the recluse<br />
					in virtue of which<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus<br />

					<p class="f4">"Enough, brahman, rise up;<br />

					since your mind was pleased with me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Brahmāyu,<br />

					sat down on his own seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord gave a talk to Brahmāyu the brahman<br />
					on various topics:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn72" href="#n72">72</a>]</sup></span><br />
					talk on giving,<br />
					talk on moral habit,<br />
					talk on heaven;<br />
					he explained the peril,<br />
					the vanity,<br />
					the depravity of the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the advantage in renouncing them.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord knew<br />
					that the mind of Brahmāyu the brahman was ready,<br />
					malleable,<br />
					devoid of the hindrances,<br />
					uplifted,<br />
					pleased,<br />
					then he explained to him<br />
					that teaching on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that the Awakened Ones have themselves discovered:<br />
					anguish,<br />
					uprising,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as a clean cloth<br />

					<p class="f4">"whatever is liable to origination<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmāyu the brahman,<br />

					attained <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					known <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					plunged into <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					having crossed over doubt,<br />
					<a id="pg331"><span class="f2 g"><b>[331]</b></span></a> put away uncertainty<br />

					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama;<br />
					it is excellent, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even, good Gotama,<br />
					as one might set upright<br />
					what had been upset,<br />
					or disclose what was covered,<br />
					or show the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					thinking that those with vision might see material shapes,<br />
					even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure<br />
					by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I am going to the revered Gotama (for refuge)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and to <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br />
					as a lay-disiple<br />
					going for refuge<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And may the revered Gotama<br />
					consent to a meal with me<br />
					on the morrow<br />
					together with the Order of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmāyu the brahman,<br />
					having understood the Lord's consent,<br />
					rising up from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Brahmāyu<br />
					having had sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					prepared in his own dwelling<br />
					towards the end of that night,<br />
					had the time announced to the Lord,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, good Gotama,<br />
					the meal is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached the dwelling of Brahmāyu the brahman;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat<br />
					together with the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did Brahmāyu the brahman<br />
					for seven days<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					serve and satisfy the Order of monks<br />
					with the Awakened One at its head<br />
					with sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at the end of the seven days<br />
					the Lord set out on tour in Videha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after the Lord had set out<br />
					Brahmāyu the brahman passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir,<br />
					Brahmāyu the brahman has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn,<br />
					what his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Clever,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span> monks,<br />
					was the brahman Brahmāyu;<br />
					he followed after <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					according to various parts of <i>Dhamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he did not <a id="pg332"><span class="f2 g"><b>[332]</b></span></a> annoy me<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with questionings about <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Brahmāyu the brahman,<br />
					by the complete destruction of the five fetters<br />
					binding to this lower (shore),<br />
					is of spontaneous uprising,<br />
					one who attains nibbāna there,<br />
					not liable to return from that world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

This <i>navamaɱ</i> has misled Chalmers, although it might be argued that his "difficulty with the ninth stage" (of meditation?) is borne out to some extent by the fact that Brahmayu is not said to have achieved arahantship, being spoken of in words descriptive only of a non-returner. But this is far-fetched, and nothing is said in this Discourse about Brahmayu attempting any of the "stages" in meditation or of becoming proficient in them.</p>
