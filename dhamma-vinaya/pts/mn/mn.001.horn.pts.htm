					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Here and in the other similar cases this should probably read: 'he thinks (of self as [a,]) being,' or, as in the case of the devas: 'he thinks (of self as [one of the] devas,'. The problem with the abbreviated form here being that it is possible for a being to think of himself [as all] beings, devas, etc., and we will never know for certain now which was intended by Ms. Horner.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Both <i>mūla</i> and <i>pariyāya</i> are words of several meanings. <i>MA.</i> i. 16-17 expands the title into <i>sabbadhammamūlapariyāya</i> a compound attributed to Gotama in his first speech in this Sutta. The <i>Comy.</i> Further says that the meaning is the breaking of pride; for the reason for this see p. ??, n. 46. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Jātaka</i> No. 245, the <a href="../kd/jat/jat.2/jat.2.245.rous.pts.htm">Mūlapariyāya jātaka,</a> which is quoted at <i>MA.</i> i. 56-8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Vana.

To the former class belong, according to <i>MA.</i> i. 11, the Bamboo Grove, the Jeta Grove, etc.; to the latter the Blind Men's Grove, the Great Grove, the Añjana Grove, etc. The Subhaga Grove is self-sown, or self-grown.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Bhūtā. See <i>Pts.</i> i. 159. <i>MA.</i> i. 31 gives various kinds: that which is among the khandhas, those which are non-human, those which are among the (four) elements (symbolised by earth, water, heat, air), that which exists as fact, that which is in one whose cankers are destroyed, creatures, and that which inhabits trees and so on. <i>MA.</i> i. 33 says that these ways of thinking about "beings" (sons and daughters, sheep and goats, cocks and swine, elephants, cows, horses, mares) arouse selfishness, affection and pride.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 33 says devas shine with the five strands of sense-pleasures or with their own natural power; they amuse themselves or they illumine. They are threefold: devas by convention (kings, queens, princes), those reborn or uprisen as devas (the Four Great Regents, and the devas beyond them), and the devas of purity (arahants whose cankers are destroyed). The second class is meant here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Here to be called <i>Māra</i>, so <i>MA.</i> i. 33. Usually <i>Pajāpati</i> is the lord of creation, but the story given at <i>MA.</i> shows <i>Māra</i> pretending to be this. For the following classes of devas see <i>Dīgha</i> Sta. 31 and <i>M.</i> Sta. 49.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> MA. i. 34 gives <i>Mahābrahmmā, Tathāgata,</i> <i>brahman,</i> parents and best as synonyms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Explained at <i>MA.</i> i. 35 as <i>vipulā phalā,</i> of extensive fruits, at the stage of the fourth jhāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>Abhibhu. MA.</i> i. 35 says that thit is a synonym for being without perception, hence advanced in the contemplative process.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> This and the three following planes, <i>āyatana,</i> are the fifth to the eighth of the nine stages in the contemplative process.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup><i>Dittha-suta-muta-viññāta.</i> As at <i>Vin.</i> iv. 2. See <i>B.D.</i> ii. 166, <i>n.</i> 3. <i>Dittha</i> and <i>suta</i> mean seen and heard by both the physical and the deva-like (<i>dibba</i>) eye and ear.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup><i>Ekatta.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 38 says, he thinks "great is my self ... this self of mine is in everything."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Here <i>Nibbāna</i> signifies the enjoyment of the five kinds of sensory pleasures. The "average man" regards these as the highest <i>Nibbāna</i> in this very life. <i>Nibbāna</i> is therefore not being used here in its Buddhist sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> The <i>Nibbāna</i> clauses are quoted at Kvu. 404.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> The learner, "undergraduate," <i>sekha</i>, the one under training, here appears as the middle term between the average worldling, <i>puthujjana,</i> and the <i>asekha,</i> the adept, "graduate," who has no further need of training. Moreover the worldling does not understand, the learner may understand, the arahant does understand.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>Appattamanasa. MA.</i> i. 41 says that <i>mānasa</i> is of three kinds: <i>rāga</i>, <i>citta, arahatta</i> (attachment, mind or consciousness, and arahantship or perfection), but here <i>arahatta</i> is meant. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Appattamānasa</i> at M. i. 477; S. i. 121, ii. 229, v. 327; A. ii. 90; and pattamānasa at It. p. 76.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Not by wrong perception as does the ordinary man, but by most excellent knowledge he knows intuitively that it is impermanent, ill, not-self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Arahant.</i> See also <i>M.</i> i. 280.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 42, "who has lived according to the ten Ariyan modes." These are given at <i>D.</i> iii. 269.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> <i>Ohitabhāra.</i> <i>MA.</i> i. 43 gives three burdens: the <i>khandhas</i> (constituents, components of the psycho-physical compound), the <i>kilesas</i> (impurities, defilements), and <i>abhisankhāra</i> (material for rebirth). See also <i>M.</i> i. 139; <i>A.</i> iii. 85 on "the burden laid low," pannabhāra.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 43 gives ten fetters which bind one to "becoming."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 43 gives two kinds of freedom: freedom of mind, and Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Tathāgata. According to <i>MA.</i> i. 45 the Lord is Tathāgata for eight reasons. Other <i>Comys.</i> Give much the same. It is therefore impossible to find one English word to convey all these meanings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Because he is thoroughly or perfectly, <i>sammā,</i> awakened to all things, and of himself, sāmam, (<i>i.e.</i> not with another's help), he is thoroughly awakened, sammāsamBuddha, <i>MA.</i> i. 52. For full discussion of this compound see <i>Vism.</i> I. 198.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 52 here reads <i>pariññātantam,</i> thoroughly understood to the end (or, to the full), while the text reads pariññātam, which the <i>Comy.</i> also recognises.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 52 calls <i>dukkha</i> the five <i>khandhas. Dukkha</i> is therefore deep, almost cosmic, anguish of the many, the "individuals," owing to their separation from the One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> Becoming, <i>bhava,</i> is here explained as "karmical becoming," <i>kammabhava,</i> becoming through deeds, see <i>MA.</i> i. 52.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 52 explains <i>bhūta,</i> what has become, by <i>satta,</i> creature. At <i>MA.</i> i. 53 it is said that "delight" is of the past, "birth, old age and dying" of the future, "suffering and becoming" of the present.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 54 ascribes this and the following three achievements to the first, the second, and the third and fourth Ways respectively.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 54, <i>bodhi</i> is free, the Way, omniscience, Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> According to <i>MA.</i> i. 56 the five hundred monks to whom this Discourse was addressed were not delighted and did not rejoice. They were ignorant and did not understand its meaning. Moreover they had thought that they were as learned as the Buddha, and said so. He then preached the <i>Mūlapariyāya</i> jataka to them and their pride was humbled and to humble pride is in a way the purpose of this Discourse, see p. 3, <i>n.</i> 1. Later, as the Buddha was on tour, he preached the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p123"><i>Gotamakasutta</i></a> (A. i. 276) to them and they became arahants. It is unusual for monks not to feel satisfied and pleased at the end of discourse, but such is the tradition in this case.</p>
