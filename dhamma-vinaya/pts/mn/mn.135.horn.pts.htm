					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, good Gotama, what is the cause,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that <a id="pg249"><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span></a> lowness and excellence<br />
					are to be seen among human beings<br />
					while they are in human form?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For, good Gotama,<br />
					human beings of short life-span are to be seen<br />
					and those of long life-span;<br />
					those of many<br />
					and those of few illnesses;<br />
					those who are ugly,<br />
					those who are beautiful;<br />
					those who are of little account,<br />
					those of great account;<br />
					those who are poor,<br />
					those who are wealthy;<br />
					those who are of lowly families,<br />
					those of high families;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					those who are weak in wisdom,<br />
					those who are full of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what, good Gotama, is the cause,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that lowness and excellence<br />
					are to be seen among human beings<br />
					while they are in human form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Deeds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> are one's own, brahman youth,<br />
					beings are heirs to deeds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					deeds are matrix,<br />
					deeds are kin,<br />
					deeds are arbiters.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Deed divides beings,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					by lowness and excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not understand the meaning in full<br />
					of that which was spoken by the good Gotama in brief<br />
					and the meaning of which was not explained in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were well if the good Gotama<br />
					were so to teach me <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that I should understand the meaning in full<br />
					of that which was spoken by the good Gotama in brief<br />
					but the meaning of which was not explained in full."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brahman youth,<br />
					listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"<br />
					the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />
					answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman youth, here some woman or man<br />
					is one that makes onslaught on creatures,<br />
					is cruel,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					intent on injuring and killing,<br />

					<p class="f4">Because of that <a id="pg250"><span class="f2 g"><b>[250]</b></span></a> deed,<br />
					accomplished thus,<br />
					firmly held<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> thus,<br />
					he, at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />

					<p class="f4">This course is conducive<br />

					<p class="f4">This course is conducive to great wisdom, <a id="pg253"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></a> brahman youth, that is to say,<br />

					<p class="f4">Deeds are one's own, brahman youth,<br />
					beings are heirs to deeds,<br />
					deeds are the matrix,<br />

					<p class="f4">Deed divides beings,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br />
					excellent, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br />
					and to <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br />

That the prefix <i>Cūḷa</i> here qualifies <i>kammavibhaṅga</i> (and not sutta) must be understood on the analogy of Mahā- in the next Discourse which, from internal evidence, is not a description of <i>sutta</i> but of <i>kammavibhaṅga;</i> see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.137.horn.pts.htm#fn5">below, p. 264, <i>n.</i> 1.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Todeyya was Pasenadi's brahman priest. He was very rich and very mean. Born as a dog in his own house, he barked at the Buddha when he was visiting Subha. The Buddha recognised him and identified him to the unwilling Subha by getting the dog to find some treasure he had hidden as a man.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>manmsānaɱ yeva sataɱ manussabhūtānaɱ.</i> This of course assumes that human beings need not always be in human form, and this appears to have been the case with Todeyya. It seems clear that some distinction between the two words is to be made although in the sequel only human beings are dealt with. Pali is precise where we perhaps cannot be. Another word to be considered in this connection is <i>manusaviggaha,</i> taking up form as a human being, see <i>Vin.</i> iii. 73 where this word is defined, and <i>Vin.</i> iv. 214 = 269, where the compound <i>tiracchānagata-manussaviggaha</i> appears to be a man who has taken up animal form.</p>
