<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 2. The Buddha describes how one who applies his mind studiously to the point is able to rid himself of disrupting influences in seven ways: by seeing them as problems; by self-control, by proper use; by patience; by avoidance; by elimination; and by awakening. Examples of each case are given." />

					<p class="f4">To one who does not pay wise attention in these ways,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Here <i>MA.</i> i. 61 says <i>pariyāya</i> is <i>karāna,</i> means or method.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>āsava.</i> There are four cankers, "influxes" or corruptions: <i>kāmāsava,</i> or attachment to the fivefold sensual realm; <i>bhavāsava,</i> attachment to <i>bhava,</i> literally "becoming," meaning attachment to the planes of form and formlessness; <i>ditthāsava,</i> the attachment to (false) views; and the <i>āsava</i> of <i>avijjā,</i> ignoring, nescience (here of the four Truths); see <i>MA.</i> i. 67 and <i>cf.</i> Nārada Mahāthera, <i>Dhp.,</i> p. 16, n. 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Yoniso manasikāraɱ,</i> attention to the means, the Way; <i>ayoniso mana-,</i> is not attending to the means, or attending to (or, in) the wrong way, turning the mind against the truth so that you think permanence is in the impermanent, happiness in suffering, self in what is not-self, and the fair in the foul; and if there is ignorance, then "conditioned by ignorance are the <i>saŋkhāras,</i>" and so on to the end of the "causal" chain: "the arising of this whole mass of anguish." See <i>MA.</i> i. 64-65.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. A.</i> iii. 387-390, where, however, "vision," the first of the seven ways of riddance, is omitted; and see <i>G.S.</i> iii. 276, n. 1. Above "vision" refers to the vision pertaining to the first stage of arahantship or perfection, the <i>sotāpattimagga,</i> from its giving the first vision of Nibbāna, <i>MA.</i> i. 74. Hence <i>saɱsāra,</i> or <i>vaṭṭa,</i> the endless round of births, is grounded on unwise attention. But a man of rational attention will develop the eightfold Way, beginning with perfect view. This is knowledge (<i>yā ca sammādiṭṭhi sā vijjā</i>): from the arising of knowledge, from the stopping of ignorance is the stopping of the <i>saŋkharas,</i> and so on to the stopping of this whole mass of anguish. Thus Nibbāna (here called vivaṭṭa, being devoid of the round of births) is said to be grounded on wise attention; <i>MA.</i> i. 64 <i>f.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>bhāvanā,</i> meaning mind-development.</p>

							<p>It would have been easier and less confusing to explain that the <i>āsava</i> of <i>avijja,</i> blindness [ignorance], being blindness to the Four Truths, (the four truths being <i>sammā diṭṭhi,</i> or high view,) that that encompassed 'false views'. Further, the <i>āsava</i> being spoken of when it occurs in the list, is not 'false views', <i>'miccha diṭṭhi'</i> but 'views', <i>'diṭṭhi'</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 07 explains the absence of the canker of false views, which often appears as the third of the four cankers, by saying: "the canker of sense-pleasure is the attraction connected with the five strands of sense-pleasure; the canker of becoming is the attachment to desire for the planes of form and formlessness; it is craving for the jhānas accompanied by the false views of eternalism and annihilationism. In this way the canker of fate views is included in the canker of becoming itself. The canker of ignorance is not knowing in regard to the four Truths."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Cf, M.</i> i. 265 for these questions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> i. 258. <i>Vado vedeyyo,</i> that speaks, that knows and feels, is explained at <i>MA.</i> i. 71 as "This is a conviction of those who hold eternalist views. Here 'that speaks' is <i>vado</i>. It is a mode of vocal act. 'That experiences (or, feels), <i>vediyati,</i> is <i>vedeyyo</i>. And it means 'that knows, that experiences' (<i>amubhavati,</i> partakes of, undergoes). What does it know-and-feel (<i>vedeti</i>)? It experiences (<i>paṭisamvedeti</i>) now here, now there, the fruits of deeds that are lovely and that are depraved. 'Now here, now there' means in this or that class of womb, bourn, station, abode." <i>Cf. MA.</i> ii. 305 on <i>vado vedeyyo:</i>" that which speaks, that knows-and-feels, and that which experiences now here, now there, the fruits of deeds that are lovely and depraved, this is that consciousness that I am speaking about."</p>
