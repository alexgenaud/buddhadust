					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyin was living in the wanderers' park<br />
					at the peacocks' feeding place<br />
					together with a large company of wanderers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Rājagaha for almsfood.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is too early to walk for almsfood in Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to approach the wanderers' park,<br />
					the peacocks' feeding place<br />
					and the wanderer Sakuludāyin</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the Lord approached the peacocks' feeding place<br />
					in the wanderers' park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyin was sitting down<br />
					with the great company of wanderers<br />
					shouting out with a loud noise,<br />
					a great noise,<br />
					talking various kinds of inferior talk<br />
					that is to say<br />
					talk on kings,<br />
					thieves,<br />
					great ministers,<br />
					armies,<br />
					fears,<br />
					battles,<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					scents,<br />
					relations,<br />
					vehicles,<br />
					villages,<br />
					market towns,<br />
					towns,<br />
					the country,<br />
					women,<br />
					heroes,<br />
					streets,<br />
					wells,<br />
					those departed before,<br />
					talk of diversity,<br />
					speculation about the world,<br />
					speculation about the sea,<br />
					talk about becoming or not becoming<br />
					thus or thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him, he called his own company to order, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sirs, let there be little noise;<br />
					do not, good sirs, make a noise;<br />
					this is the recluse Gotama who is coming</p>

					<p class="f4">The the recluse Gotama wishes for little noise,<br />
					is trained to little noise,<br />
					praises little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he may consider approaching<br />
					if he knows that this is a company of little noise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord approached the wanderer Sakuludāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the revered one come,<br />
					there is a welcome for the revered one;<br />
					it is long since the revered one made this opportunity!</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say for coming here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the revered one sit down,<br />
					this seat is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord sat down on the seat that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the wanderer Sakuludāyin,<br />
					having taken a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the talk<br />
					for which you are now gathered together here, Udāyin?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what was your talk<br />
					that was interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let be that talk, revered sir,<br />
					for which we are now gathered together here.</p>

					<p class="f4">It will not be difficult<br />
					for the Lord to hear this talk later.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I, Lord,<br />
					am not near this company,<br />
					then this company is sitting down<br />
					talking a variety of inferior talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Lord,<br />
					am near this company,<br />
					then this company is sitting down<br />
					gazing at my face,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will listen to whatever <i>dhamma</i><br />
					the recluse Udāyin speaks to us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Lord, the Lord is near this company,<br />
					then I and this company<br />
					are alike sitting down<br />
					gazing at the Lord's face,<br />
					and saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will listen to whatever <i>dhamma</i><br />
					the Lord speaks to us.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Udāyin,<br />
					let something occur to you here<br />
					so that you can speak it to me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Some time ago, revered sir,<br />
					one who was all-knowing,<br />
					all-seeing,<br />
					claiming all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<br />
					said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep<br />
					or awake,<br />
					knowledge-and-vision is constantly<br />
					and perpetually<br />
					before me.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He, on being asked a <a id="pg229"><span class="f2 g"><b>[229]</b></span></a> question by me<br />
					concerning the past,<br />
					shelved the question by (asking) another,<br />
					answered off the point<br />
					and evinced temper<br />
					and ill-will<br />
					and sulkiness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It was because of this, revered sir,<br />
					that rapture arose in me<br />
					respecting the Lord,<br />
					and I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ah, indeed it is the Lord,<br />
					ah, indeed it is the Well-farer<br />
					that is skilled in these matters.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who was this, Udāyin,<br />
					that all-knowing,<br />
					all-seeing,<br />
					claiming all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<br />
					said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep<br />
					or awake,<br />
					knowledge-and-vision is constantly<br />
					and perpetually before me,'<br />
					and who,<br />
					on being asked a question by you<br />
					concerning the past,<br />
					shelved the question by (asking) another,<br />
					answered off the point<br />
					and evinced temper<br />
					and ill-will<br />
					and sulkiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, it was Nātaputta the Jain."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Udāyin,<br />
					whoever could recollect a variety of former habitations,<br />
					that is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />

					such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />

					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here<br />

					to answering his question concerning the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Udāyin,<br />

					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />

					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />

					<p class="f4">And thus with the purified deva-vision<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Udāyin,<br />

					<p class="f4">I will teach you dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">If this is,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But I, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here</p>

					<p class="f4">and say that I recollect a variety of former habitations<br />

					like the Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, revered sir,<br />
					do not even see a mud-sprite<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> at present.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then should I<br />

					<p class="f4">like the <a id="pg230"><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></a> Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">So that when, revered sir, the Lord spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let be the past,<br />

					<p class="f4">I will teach you dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">If this is,<br />

					<p class="f4">- then that is not abundantly clear to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">"What do your own teachers say, Udāyin?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, our own teachers speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when your own teachers speak thus to you, Udāyin:</p>

					<p class="f4">which is this highest lustre?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, there is no other lustre<br />

					it is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But which is this lustre, Udāyin,<br />

					superior or more excellent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, there is no other lustre<br />
					superior to<br />

					it is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You would be long in expanding this, Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">You say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, there is no other lustre<br />

					or more excellent than this lustre,<br />
					it is the highest lustre,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but you do not point to this lustre.</p>

					<p class="f4">Udāyin, it is as though a man should say:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br />

							<p>Ms. Horner's translation does not provide an argument that would have settled the question.<br />
							Bhks. Bodhi/Ñāṇamolī have got the meaning more clearly:<br />
							"Does the realisation of an entirely pleasant world come about by following a way of mixed pleasure and pain?"<br />
							The consequence of abstaining from an unskillful behavior, when the unpleasant sensations from withdrawing from the habit have been completely eliminated, is neutral feeling. This is kamma of intentional not-doing. For the one following Gotama's system this will be a taste of Nibbāna, (happiness based on freedom from sensation) but not pleasant sensation; for one not following Gotama's system neutral feeling is a basis for dissatisfaction and consequent seeking of pleasure-producing sense-stimulation which has uncertain immediate results and pain as it's ultimate consequence.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having got rid of covetousness for the world,<br />

					<p class="f4">He, by getting rid Of these five hindrances -<br />
					defilements of a mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom -  <br />
					aloof from pleasure of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters and abides in the first meditation,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is a thing, Udāyin,<br />

					<p class="f4">And again, Udāyin, a monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is a thing, Udāyin,<br />

					<p class="f4">And again, Udāyin, a monk,<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters and abides in the fourth meditation,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />

					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here<br />
					and could recollect thus<br />

					a variety of former habitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a thing, Udāyin,<br />
					for the sake of realising which<br />
					monks fare the Brahma-faring under me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind to the knowledge<br />
					of the passing hence<br />
					and coming to be of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					he beholds beings as they are passing hence<br />
					and coming to be,<br />
					mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in speech,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					he sees beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					and he comprehends that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a thing,<br />

					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />

					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind to the knowledge<br />
					of the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is anguish,<br />
					this the arising of anguish,<br />
					this the stopping of anguish,<br />
					this the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the cankers,<br />
					this the arising of the cankers,<br />
					this the stopping of the cankers,<br />
					this the course leading to the stopping of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing thus,<br />
					seeing thus,<br />
					his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures<br />

					and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom<br />
					the knowledge comes to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am freed";</p>

					<p class="f4">and he comprehends:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more<br />
					of being such or so.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a thing,<br />

					<p class="f4">These, Udāyin, are the things,<br />
					superior and more excellent,<br />
					for the sake of realising which<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the wanderer Sakuludāyin spoke thus to <a id="pg236"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span></a> the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, revered sir,<br />
					excellent, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, revered sir,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so in many a figure<br />
					is dhamma made clear by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, am going to the Lord for refuge<br />
					and to dhamma<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I, revered sir,<br />
					receive the going forth in the Lord's presence,<br />
					may I receive ordination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said<br />
					the company of the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br />
					spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, good Udāyin,<br />
					fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					under the recluse Gotama;<br />
					do not, good Udāyin,<br />
					having been a teacher,<br />
					live as a pupil.</p>

					<p class="f4">As what was once a good water-pot<br />
					might spring a leak,<br />
					so would be this performance<br />
					of the good Udāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not, good Udāyin,<br />
					fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					under the recluse Gotama;<br />
					do not, good Udāyin,<br />
					having been a teacher,<br />
					live as a pupil."</p>

					<p class="f4">It was thus that the company of the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br />
					made for the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br />
					a stumbling-block in (the way of) the Brahma-faring under the Lord.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>
