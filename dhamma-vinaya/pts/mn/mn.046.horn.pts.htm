					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the most part, monks,<br />
					beings wish like this,<br />
					desire like this,<br />
					intend like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 may unpleasant,<br />
					unenjoyable,<br />
					disagreeable things<br />
					dwindle away,</p>

					<p class="f4">0 may pleasant,<br />
					enjoyable,<br />
					agreeable things<br />
					grow much,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, unpleasant,<br />
					unenjoyable,<br />
					disagreeable things<br />
					grow much<br />
					in those beings of such wishes,<br />
					such desires,<br />
					such intentions;</p>

					<p class="f4">pleasant,<br />
					enjoyable,<br />
					agreeable things<br />
					dwindle away.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, what do you, monks,<br />
					take to be the cause?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Things for us,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Lord,<br />
					are rooted in the Lord,<br />
					have the Lord for conduit,<br />
					the Lord for arbiter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were good indeed, Lord,<br />
					if the meaning of this speech of the Lord's<br />
					were explained;<br />
					having heard the Lord,<br />
					monks would remember."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, monks, listen,<br />
					attend carefully,<br />
					I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, monks,<br />

					he does not follow things that should be followed,<br />
					he associates with things that should not be associated with,<br />
					he does not associate with <a id="pg373"><span class="f2 g"><b>[373]</b></span></a> things that should be associated with.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is following things that should not be followed,<br />

					disagreeable<br />
					things grow much,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					enjoyable,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					things dwindle away.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is so, monks,<br />
