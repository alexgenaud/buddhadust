					<p class="f4">This too is impossible, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is thus, monks, that a bad man has the views of bad men.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a bad man<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks, a bad man<br />
					gives a gift disrespectfully,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he gives a gift not with his own hand,<br />
