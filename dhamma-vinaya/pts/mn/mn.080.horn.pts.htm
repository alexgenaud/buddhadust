					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapinḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vekhanassa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached, <a id="pg237"><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span></a> he greeted the Lord;<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					the wanderer Vekhanassa uttered a solemn utterance<br />
					in the Lord's presence:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the highest lustre,<br />
					this is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why do you, Kaccāna,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the highest lustre,<br />
					this is the highest lustre?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is this highest lustre?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br />
					superior to<br />
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br />
					it is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But which, Kaccāna,<br />
					is this lustre<br />
					than which there is no other lustre<br />
					superior or more excellent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br />
					superior to<br />
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br />
					it is the highest lustre."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You would be long in expanding this, Kaccāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">You say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good Gotama, there is no other lustre<br />
					superior to<br />
					or more excellent than this lustre,<br />
					it is the highest lustre.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But you do not point to this lustre.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kaccāna, it is as though a man should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whoever is the belle of this countryside,<br />
					I want her,<br />
					I desire her.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Another man might say to him:</p>

					whom you want and desire<br />
					is a noble maiden<br />
					or a brahmin<br />
					or a merchant<br />
					or a worker?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br />
					do you know the name<br />
					or the clan<br />
					of this belle of the countryside<br />
					whom you want and desire?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br />
					do you know whether she is tall<br />
					or short<br />
					or of medium height,<br />
					or dark<br />
					or brown<br />
					or sallow;<br />
					or what village<br />
					or market town<br />
					or what town<br />
					she belongs to?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The other might speak to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br />
					do you want and desire<br />
					her whom you know not,<br />
					see not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Asked this, he might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Kaccāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so,<br />
					surely that man's irresponsible talk<br />

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But even so do you, Kaccāna, say:</p>
