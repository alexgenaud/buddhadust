					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>
