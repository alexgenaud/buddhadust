					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> emerging from solitary meditation towards evening, approached the venerable Sāriputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>: having approached, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Koṭṭhita the Great spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>
