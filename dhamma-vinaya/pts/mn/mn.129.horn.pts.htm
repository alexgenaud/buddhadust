					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these are the three marks of a fool,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					signs of a fool,<br />
					stamps of a fool.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks, a fool is one thinking wrong thoughts,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					speaking wrong words,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a doer of deeds wrongly done.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a fool were not one thinking wrong thoughts,<br />
					speaking wrong words,<br />
					and a doer of deeds wrongly done,<br />
					how could the wise know of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This fine fellow is a fool,<br />
					not a true man?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because, monks, a fool is one thinking wrong thoughts,<br />
					speaking wrong words,<br />
					and a doer of deeds wrongly done,<br />
					that the wise know of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This fine fellow is a fool,<br />
					not a true man.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, he who is a fool<br />
					experiences a threefold anguish and dejection<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a fool is sitting down<br />
					in an assembly room<br />
					or by a carriage-road<br />
					or at a cross-roads<br />
					and if the people there held appropriate suitable talk about him<br />
					and if, monks, the fool were one who made onslaught on creatures,<br />
					were a taker of what had not been given,<br />
					one who behaved wrongly in regard to sense-pleasures,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					and one given up to occasions for sloth<br />
					consequent upon (drinking) arrack,<br />
					toddy<br />
					and strong liquor,<br />
					and if, monks, it then occurs to that fool:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These people are holding an appropriate suitable talk about me,<br />
					for these states exist in me<br />
					and I engage in<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> these states,'</p>

					<p class="f4">this, monks, is the first (kind of) anguish and dejection<br />
					that the fool experiences<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a fool sees kings<br />
					who, having arrested a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					are meting out various punishments:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they lash <a id="pg210"><span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span></a> him with whips,<br />
					and they lash him with canes,<br />
					and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br />
					and they cut off his hand,<br />
					and they cut off his foot,<br />
					and they cut off his hand and foot,<br />
					and they cut off his his ear,<br />
					and they cut off his his nose,<br />
					and they cut off his his ear and nose,<br />
					and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'<br />
					and they spray him with burning oil,<br />
					give him as food to the dogs,<br />
					impale him alive on stakes,<br />
					and they decapitate him with a sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the fool:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Because of such and such evil deeds<br />
					kings, having arrested a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					mete out various punishments:<br />
					they lash him with whips,<br />
					and they lash him with canes,<br />
					and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br />
					and they cut off his hand,<br />
					and they cut off his foot,<br />
					and they cut off his hand and foot,<br />
					and they cut off his his ear,<br />
					and they cut off his his nose,<br />
					and they cut off his his ear and nose,<br />
					and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'<br />
					and they spray him with burning oil,<br />
					give him as food to the dogs,<br />
					impale him alive on stakes,<br />
					and they decapitate him with a sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these states exist in me<br />
					and I engage in these states.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if kings should know about me,<br />
					they might have me arrested too,<br />
					and mete out various punishments:<br />
					they might lash me with whips,<br />
					they might lash me with canes,<br />
					they might lash me with (birch) rods,<br />
					they might cut off my hand,<br />
					they might cut off my foot,<br />
					they might cut off my hand and foot,<br />
					they might cut off my my ear,<br />
					they might cut off my my nose,<br />
					they might cut off my his ear and nose,<br />
					they might give me the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'antelope' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'pickling process' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br />
					they might give me the 'straw-mattress,'<br />
					they might spray me with burning oil,<br />
					give me as food to the dogs,<br />
					impale me alive on stakes,<br />
					and they decapitate me with a sword.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second (kind' of) anguish and dejection<br />
					that the fool experiences<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />
					while a fool is on a chair<br />
					or bed<br />
					or lying on the ground,<br />
					at such a time those evil deeds<br />
					that he has formerly wrongly done<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					rest on him,<br />
					lie on him,<br />
					settle on him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as at eventide<br />
					the shadows of the great mountain peaks<br />
					rest,<br />
					lie<br />
					and settle on the earth,<br />
					so, monks, do these evil deeds<br />
					that the fool has formerly wrongly done<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					rest,<br />
					lie<br />
					and settle on him<br />
					as he is on a chair<br />
					or bed<br />
					or lying on the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs thus to the fool:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed what is lovely<br />
					has not been done by me,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					what is skilled<br />
					has not been done,<br />
					no refuge against fearful (consequences)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					has been made,<br />
					evil has been done,<br />
					cruelty has been done,<br />
					violence has been done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Insofar as there is a bourn<br />
					for those who have not done what is lovely,<br />
					have not done what is skilled,<br />
					have not made a refuge against fearful (consequences),<br />
					who have done evil, cruelty and violence,<br />
					to that bourn I am going hereafter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />
					beats his breast,<br />
					wails<br />
					and falls into disillusionment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, <a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> monks, is the third (kind of) anguish and dejection<br />
					that the fool experiences<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He, monks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> who is a fool,<br />
					having fared wrongly in body,<br />
					having fared wrongly in speech,<br />
					having fared wrongly in thought,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arises in the sorrowful ways,<br />
					the bad bourn,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anyone, monks, speaking rightly of him<br />
					would say he is thoroughly undesirable,<br />
					thoroughly disagreeable,<br />
					thoroughly unpleasant,<br />
					as in speaking rightly of Niraya Hell<br />
					he would say it is thoroughly undesirable,<br />
					thoroughly disagreeable,<br />
					thoroughly unpleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />
					even a simile is not easy,<br />
					so many are the anguishes of Niraya Hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is it possible<br />
					to make a simile for me, revered sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is possible, monk,"<br />
					the Lord said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is as though, monk,<br />
					men should arrest a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					and bring him before the king,<br />
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, sire, is a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decree for him<br />
					whatever punishment you wish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and the king should speak thus concerning him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go along, good sirs,<br />
					stab<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> this man early in the morning<br />
					with a hundred spears.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And early in the morning<br />
					they would stab him with a hundred spears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at midday the king would speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good fellows,<br />
					how is that man?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is still alive, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king would speak thus concerning him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go along, good sirs,<br />
					stab this man at midday<br />
					with a hundred spears.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And at midday they would stab him with a hundred spears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then towards evening<br />
					the king would speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good fellows,<br />
					how is that man?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is still alive, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king would speak thus concerning him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go along, good sirs,<br />
					stab this man towards evening<br />
					with a hundred spears.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And towards evening<br />
					they would stab him with a hundred spears.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, monks,<br />
					would not that man,<br />
					while he was being stabbed with three hundred spears,<br />
					from that source experience anguish and dejection?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That man, revered sir,<br />
					being stabbed with only one spear<br />
					from that source would experience anguish and dejection.</p>

					<p class="f4">How much more then<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with three hundred spears?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a> Then the Lord,<br />
					having picked up a small stone the size of his hand,<br />
					addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, which is the greater,<br />
					this small stone,<br />
					the size of my hand,<br />
					that I have picked up,<br />
					or the Himalaya,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> lord of mountains?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This small stone, revered sir,<br />
					that the Lord picked up,<br />
					the size of his hand,<br />
					is insignificant;<br />
					compared with the Himalaya, lord of mountains,<br />
					it does not count,<br />
					it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),<br />
					it cannot even be compared (with it)."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, monks, that anguish and dejection<br />
					that that man experiences<br />
					while he is being stabbed with three hundred spears,<br />
					compared with the anguish of Niraya Hell<br />
					does not count,<br />
					it does not amount even to an infinitesimal fraction (of it),<br />
					it cannot even be compared (with it).</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					subject him to what is called the fivefold pinion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">They drive a red-hot iron stake<br />
					through each hand<br />
					and each foot<br />
					and a red-hot iron stake<br />
					through the middle of his breast.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not do his time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					lay him down<br />
					and plane him with adzes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br />
					until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					place him feet up<br />
					and head down<br />
					and plane him with razors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br />
					until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					bind him to a chariot<br />
					and drive him up and down<br />
					over ground that is burning,<br />
					aflame,<br />
					ablaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br />
					until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					push him up and down<br />
					a great mountain slope<br />
					of glowing cinders,<br />
					burning,<br />
					aflame,<br />
					ablaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br />
					until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					take him,<br />
					feet up and head down,<br />
					and plunge him into a glowing brazen cauldron,<br />
					burning,<br />
					aflame,<br />
					ablaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he is boiled<br />
					and rises to the surface with the <a id="pg213"><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></a> scum.</p>

					<p class="f4">Boiling there<br />
					and rising to the surface with the scum,<br />
					he comes up once<br />
					and goes down once<br />
					and once he goes across.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat he feels feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not do his time<br />
					until he makes an end of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the guardians of Niraya Hell<br />
					toss him into the Great Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, this Great Niraya Hell<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					(is so described):</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Four-cornered and with four gates,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
							It is divided into equal portions,<br />
							Encircled by an iron wall, with a roof of iron above;<br />
							Its incandescent floor is made of glowing iron;<br />
							All round it stands a hundred yojanas square.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In many a disquisition could I, monks,<br />
					talk a talk about Niraya Hell,<br />
					but it is not easy to describe in full,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> monks,<br />
					so many are the anguishes of Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, monks, animals,<br />
					breathing creatures<br />
					that are grass-eaters.</p>

					<p class="f4">These eat moist and dry grasses,<br />
					chewing them with their teeth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And which, monks, are the animals,<br />

					<p class="f4">In many a disquisition could I, monks,<br />
					talk a talk about animal birth,<br />
					but it is not easy to describe in full, monks,<br />
					so many are the anguishes of animal birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is like a man<br />

					<p class="f4">An easterly wind might take it westwards,<br />

					<p class="f4">There might be <a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> a blind turtle there<br />

					once in a hundred years.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that blind turtle<br />

					<p class="f4">"If at all,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Sooner or later, monks,<br />
					could the blind turtle<br />
					push his neck through the one hole in the yoke;<br />
					more difficult than that,<br />
					do I say, monks,<br />
					is human status once again<br />
					for the fool who has gone to the Downfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there is no <i>dhamma</i>-faring there,<br />
					no even-faring,<br />
					no doing of what is skilled,<br />
					no doing of what is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there is devouring of one another there<br />
					and feeding on the weak.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if some time or other<br />
					once in a very long while<br />
					that fool came to human status (again),<br />
					he would be born into those families that are low;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a family of low caste<br />

					<p class="f4">Moreover, he would be ill-favoured,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					dwarfish,<br />

					<p class="f4">Because he had fared wrongly in body,<br />

					and thought,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					he would arise in the sorrowful ways,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is as though a gambler<br />
					at the very first losing throw (at dice)<br />

					were to undergo imprisonment himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Insignificant, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />
					a wise man is one thinking right thoughts,<br />
					speaking right words,<br />
					and a doer of deeds rightly done.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a wise man<br />

					speaking right words,<br />
					a doer of deeds rightly done,<br />
					how could the wise know of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy man is a wise man,<br />
					a true man?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because, monks, a wise man is one thinking right thoughts,<br />
					speaking right words,<br />
					a doer of deeds rightly done,<br />
					that the wise know of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This worthy man is a wise man,<br />
					a true man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, he who is a wise man<br />
					experiences a threefold happiness and joy<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, the wise man is sitting down<br />
					in an assembly room<br />
					or by a carriage road<br />
					or at a cross-roads<br />
					and the people there held appropriate suitable talk about him,<br />
					and if, monks, the wise man<br />
					abstained from onslaught on creatures,<br />
					from taking what had not been given,<br />
					from wrong behaviour in regard to the sense-pleasures,<br />
					from lying,<br />
					from occasions for sloth<br />
					consequent upon (drinking) arrack,<br />
					toddy<br />
					and strong liquor,<br />
					and if, monks, it thereupon occurred to the wise man:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These people are holding an appropriate suitable talk about me;<br />
					these states exist in me<br />
					and I engage in these states' -<br />
					this, monks, is the first (kind of) happiness and joy<br />
					that the wise man experiences<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a wise man<br />
					sees kings who having arrested a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					are meting out various punishments:<br />
					they lash him with whips,<br />
					and they lash him with canes,<br />
					and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br />
					and they cut off his hand,<br />
					and they cut off his foot,<br />
					and they cut off his hand and foot,<br />
					and they cut off his his ear,<br />
					and they cut off his his nose,<br />
					and they cut off his his ear and nose,<br />
					and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'shell-tonsure' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'Rāhu's mouth' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'fire-garland' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'flaming hand' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'hay-twist' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'bark-dress' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'antelope' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'flesh-hooking' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'disc-slice' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'pickling process' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'circling the pin' punishment,<br />
					and they give him the 'straw-mattress,'<br />
					and they spray him with burning oil,<br />
					give him as food to the dogs,<br />
					impale him alive on stakes,<br />
					and they decapitate him with a sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the wise man:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Because of such and such evil deeds<br />
					kings, having arrested a thief,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					mete out various punishments:<br />
					they lash him with whips,<br />

					and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br />
					and they cut off his hand,<br />

					<p class="f4">But these states do not exist in me<br />
					and I do not engage in these states.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second (kind of) happiness and joy<br />
					that the wise man experiences<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />
					while a wise man is on a chair<br />
					or bed<br />
					or lying on the ground,<br />
					at such a time<br />
					those lovely deeds that he has formerly rightly done<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					rest on him,<br />
					lie on him,<br />
					settle on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as at eventide the shadows of the great mountain peaks rest,<br />
					lie<br />
					and settle<br />
					on the earth,<br />
					so, monks, do those lovely deeds<br />

					rest,<br />
					lie<br />
					and settle on him<br />
					as he is on a chair<br />
					or bed<br />
					or lying on the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks, it occurs to the wise man:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed what is evil<br />
					has not been done by me,<br />
					cruelty has not been done,<br />
					violence has not been done,<br />
					what is lovely has been done,<br />
					what is skilled has been done,<br />
					a refuge against fearful (consequences) has been found.</p>

					<p class="f4">Insofar as there is a bourn<br />
					for those who have not done evil,<br />
					cruelty<br />
					or violence,<br />
					who have done what is lovely,<br />
					what is skilled,<br />
					and who have found a refuge<br />
					against fearful (consequences),<br />
					to that bourn I am going hereafter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not grieve,<br />
					mourn,<br />
					lament,<br />
					beat his breast,<br />
					wail<br />
					or fall into disillusionment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third (kind of) happiness and joy<br />
					that the wise man experiences<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, monks, who is a wise man,<br />
					having fared rightly in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arises in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anyone, monks, speaking rightly of him<br />
					would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thoroughly desirable,<br />
					thoroughly agreeable,<br />

					he would say:<br />
					'Thoroughly desirable,<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />
					even a simile is not easy,<br />
					so many are the happinesses of heaven."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is it possible, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, monk,<br />
					when a noble anointed king<br />
