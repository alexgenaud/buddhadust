					<p class="f4">And what, brahman, are the things<br />

					<p class="f4">Brahman, some monk here,<br />
					aloof from the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering into the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, the monk,<br />
					by allaying initial and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters into<br />

					the second meditation,<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, the monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious;<br />
					and he experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful';<br />
					and entering into the third meditation,<br />
					he abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg252"><span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span></a> again, brahman, the monk<br />

					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					and by the going down<br />

					entering into the fourth meditation,<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by passing quite beyond<br />
					all perception of material shapes,<br />
					by the going down of perception of sensory reactions,<br />
					by not attending to perceptions of variety,<br />
					thinking:<br />
					'Ether is unending,'<br />
					entering on the plane of infinite ether,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by passing quite beyond the plane of infinite ether,<br />
					thinking:<br />
					'Consciousness is unending,'<br />
					entering on the plane of infinite consciousness,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by passing quite beyond the plane of infinite consciousness,<br />
					thinking,<br />
					'There is not anything,'<br />
					entering on the plane of no-thing,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by passing quite beyond the plane of no-thing,<br />
					entering on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by passing quite beyond the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />

					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having seen by intuitive wisdom<br />
					his cankers are utterly destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, brahman, is a state<br />
					that is higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brahman, are the states<br />
					that are higher and more excellent<br />
					than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahman, it is like a man walking about<br />
					aiming at the pith,<br />
					seeking for the pith,<br />
					looking about for the pith<br />
					of a great, stable and pithy tree,<br />
					and who,<br />
					having cut out the pith itself,<br />
					might go away taking it with him,<br />
					knowing it to be the pith.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with vision,<br />
					having seen him,<br />
					might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this good man knows the pith,<br />
					he knows the softwood,<br />
					he knows the bark,<br />
					he knows the young shoots,<br />
					he knows the branches and foliage,<br />
					inasmuch as this good man<br />
					walking about aiming at the pith,<br />
					seeking for the pith,<br />
					looking about for the pith<br />
					of a great, stable and pithy tree,<br />
					having cut out the pith itself,<br />
					is going away taking it with him,<br />
					knowing it to be the pith.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will he get the good<br />
					that could be done by the pith<br />
					because it is the pith.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In accordance with this simile, brahman,<br />
					do I call this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, brahman, that this Brahma-faring<br />
					is not for advantage in gains, honours, fame,<br />
					it is not for advantage in moral habit,<br />
					it is not for advantage in concentration,<br />
					it is not for advantage in knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahman, which is unshakable <a id="pg253"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></a> freedom of mind,<br />
					this is the goal, brahman,<br />
					of this Brahma-faring,<br />
					this the pith,<br />
					this the culmination."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Piṇgalakoccha the brahman spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, good Gotama,<br />
					good Gotama it is wonderful.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br />
					and to <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the good Gotama accept me<br />
					as a lay-follower,<br />
					one gone for refuge from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>
