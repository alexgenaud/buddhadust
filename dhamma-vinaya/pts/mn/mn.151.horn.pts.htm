					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove<br />
					at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta,</a><br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards <a id="pg343"><span class="f2 g"><b>[343]</b></span></a> evening,<br />
					approached the Lord; having approached and greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Your faculties are very bright, Sāriputta,<br />
					your complexion very pure,<br />
					very clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">In which abiding are you, Sāriputta,<br />
					now abiding in the fullness thereof?"</p>

					now abide in the fullness thereof."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"It is good, Sāriputta,<br />

					in the abiding of great men.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'May I now abide in fullness<br />
