					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta Grove<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when a number of monks<br />
					had returned from the alms-gathering<br />
					after the meal and were sitting down<br />
					gathered together in an assembly hall,<br />
					there arose this conversation:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, revered sirs,<br />
					it is wonderful, revered sirs,<br />
					that mindfulness of body<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					when developed and made much of<br />
					is of great fruit,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					as was said<br />
					by the Lord who knows,<br />
					who sees,<br />
					the perfected one,<br />
					the fully Self-Awakened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">But this conversation between these monks<br />
					was interrupted.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the Lord,<br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the assembly hall;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down,<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What were you talking about here, monks,<br />
					as you were sitting down?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what was your conversation<br />
					that was interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, revered sir,<br />
					when we had returned from the alms-gathering<br />
					after our meal<br />
					and were sitting down<br />
					gathered together <a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> in the assembly hall<br />
					this conversation arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is marvellous, revered sirs,<br />
					it is wonderful, revered sirs,<br />
					that mindfulness of body<br />
					when developed and made much of<br />
					is of great fruit,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					as was said<br />
					by the Lord who knows,<br />
					who sees,<br />
					the perfected one,<br />
					the fully Self-Awakened One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, revered sir,<br />
					was our conversation that was interrupted,<br />
					for then the Lord arrived."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, monks,<br />
					when mindfulness of body<br />
					has been developed,<br />
					how<br />
					when it has been made much of,<br />
					is it of great fruit,<br />
					of great advantage?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks, a monk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> who is forest-gone<br />
					or gone to the root of a tree<br />
					or gone to an empty place,<br />
					sits down cross-legged,<br />
					holding his back erect,<br />
					arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindful he breathes in,<br />
					mindful he breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he is breathing in a long (breath)<br />
					he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing out a long (breath)<br />
					he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a long (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing in a short (breath)<br />
					he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing in a short (breath)';</p>

					<p class="f4">or whether he is breathing out a short (breath)<br />
					he comprehends,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am breathing out a short (breath).'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will breath in<br />
					experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will breath out<br />
					experiencing the whole body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will breath in<br />
					tranquillising the activity of body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will breath out<br />
					tranquillising the activity of body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is thus diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					those memories and aspirations<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that are worldly<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are got rid of;<br />
					by getting rid of them<br />
					the mind itself is inwardly settled,<br />
					calmed,<br />
					focussed,<br />
					concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, does a monk<br />
					develop mindfulness of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />
					when a monk is walking<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he comprehends,<br />
					'I am walking';<br />
					or when he is standing still<br />
					he comprehends,<br />
					'I am standing still';<br />
					or when he is sitting down<br />
					he comprehends,<br />
					'I am sitting down';<br />
					or when he is lying down<br />
					he comprehends,<br />
					'I am lying down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So that however his body is disposed<br />
					he comprehends<br />
					that it is like that.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is thus diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					those memories and aspirations<br />
					that are worldly<br />
					are got rid of;<br />
					by getting rid of them<br />
					the mind itself is inwardly settled,<br />
					calmed,<br />
					focussed,<br />
					concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus too, monks,<br />
					does a monk develop<br />
					mindfulness of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a monk,<br />
					when he is setting out<br />
					or returning<br />
					is one acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he is looking in front<br />
					or looking around<br />
					is one acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he has bent in<br />
					or stretched out (his arm)<br />
					is one acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he is carrying his outer cloak,<br />
					bowl<br />
					and robe<br />
					is one acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he is eating,<br />
					drinking,<br />
					chewing,<br />
					tasting<br />
					is one acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he is obeying the calls of nature<br />
					is one acting in a clearly conscious way;<br />
					when he is walking,<br />
					standing,<br />
					sitting,<br />
					asleep,<br />
					awake,<br />
					talking,<br />
					silent,<br />
					he is one acting in a clearly conscious way.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he <a id="pg131"><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></a> is thus diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					those memories and aspirations<br />
					that are worldly<br />
					are got rid of;<br />
					by getting rid of them<br />
					the mind itself is inwardly settled,<br />
					calmed,<br />
					focussed,<br />
					concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus too, monks,<br />
					does a monk develop<br />
					mindfulness of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />
					a monk reflects<br />
					precisely on this body itself,<br />
					encased as it is in skin<br />
					and full of various impurities,<br />
					from the soles of the feet up<br />
					and from the crown of the head down,<br />
					that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is connected with this body<br />
					hair of the head,<br />
					hair of the body,<br />
					nails,<br />
					teeth,<br />
					skin,<br />
					flesh,<br />
					sinews,<br />
					bones,<br />
					marrow,<br />
					kidneys,<br />
					heart,<br />
					liver,<br />

					sweat,<br />
					fat,<br />
					tears,<br />
					serum,<br />
					saliva,<br />
					mucus,<br />
					synovic fluid,<br />
					urine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is as if there were<br />
					a double mouthed provision bag<br />
					that was full of various kinds of grain<br />
					such as hill-paddy,<br />
					paddy,<br />
					kidney beans,<br />
					peas,<br />
					sesamum,<br />
					rice;<br />
					and a keen-eyed man,<br />
					pouring them out,<br />
					might reflect:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's hill-paddy,<br />
					that's paddy,<br />
					that's kidney beans,<br />
					that's peas,<br />
					that's sesamum,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus too, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />

					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this body<br />
					there is the element of extension,<br />
					there is the element of cohesion,<br />
					there is the element of radiation,<br />
					there is the element of motion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is as if a skilled cattle-butcher<br />
					or his apprentice,<br />
					having slaughtered a cow,<br />
					might sit at the crossroads<br />
					displaying its carcase.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br />
