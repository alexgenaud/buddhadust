					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid<br />
					with as many as five hundred nuns<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					she stood at a respectful distance.<br />
					As she was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, <a id="pg323"><span class="f2 g"><b>[323]</b></span></a> let the Lord exhort the nuns;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord instruct the nuns;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord make a talk on <i>Dhamma</i> for the nuns."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the monks who were elders used to exhort the nuns in turn;<br />
					but the venerable Nandaka<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> did not want to exhort the nuns in (his) turn.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					So the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, whose turn is it today to exhort the nuns by turn?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is Nandaka's turn, revered sir,<br />
					to exhort the nuns by turn;<br />
					but this venerable Nandaka, revered sir,<br />
					does not want to exhort the nuns in (his) turn."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Nandaka, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Exhort the nuns, Nandaka;<br />
					instruct the nuns, Nandaka;<br />
					do you, brahman,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> make a talk on <i>Dhamma</i> for the nuns."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir," answered the venerable Nandaka in assent to the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dressed in the early morning<br />
					and, taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.<br />
					When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī,<br />
					on returning from the alms-gathering after the meal<br />
					he approached the King's Monastery<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> without a companion.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance,<br />
					and on seeing him they made ready a seat<br />
					and set out water for (washing) the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready<br />
					and as he was sitting down he washed his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when those nuns had greeted the venerable Nandaka<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Nandaka spoke thus to those nuns<br />
					as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sisters, there will be a talk by way of putting questions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who understand (each question) should say:<br />
					'We understand';<br />
					those who do not understand should say:<br />
					'We do not understand.'<br />
					<a id="pg324"><span class="f2 g"><b>[324]</b></span></a> But if anyone has any doubt or perplexity<br />
					I should be questioned about it thus:<br />
					'How is this, revered sir?<br />
					What is the meaning of that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So far, revered sir, we are pleased and satisfied with the master Nandaka<br />
					in that the master Nandaka invites us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, sisters?<br />
					Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is what is impermanent, anguish<br />
					or happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Anguish, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is right to regard that which is impermanent,<br />
					anguish and liable to alteration as,<br />
					'This is mine,<br />
					this am I,<br />
					this is my self.'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, sisters?<br />
					Is the ear permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Already, revered sir, by means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, sisters, it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is thus, sisters,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is, sisters, like the oil for lighting an oil-lamp<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, sisters, it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is thus, sisters,<br />
					that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">It is, sisters, like the roots of a great, stable and pithy tree<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, sisters,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, sisters, it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is thus, sisters,<br />
					that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					this is seen by an Ariyan disciple as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, sisters, as if a clever cattle-butcher<br />
					or cattle-butcher's apprentice,<br />
					having killed a cow,<br />
					should dissect the cow with a butcher's sharp knife<br />
					without spoiling the flesh within,<br />
					without spoiling the outer hide,<br />
					and with the butcher's sharp knife<br />
					should cut,<br />
					should cut around,<br />
					should cut all around<br />
					whatever tendons, sinews and ligaments there are there within;<br />
					and having cut,<br />
					cut around,<br />
					cut all around<br />
					and removed the outer hide and,<br />
					having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,<br />
					should then speak thus:<br />
					'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Speaking thus, sisters, would he be speaking rightly?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Although, revered sir, that clever cattle-butcher<br />

					and removed the outer hide and,<br />
					having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,<br />
					should then speak thus:<br />
					'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'<br />
					yet that cow is not conjoined with that hide."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have made this simile for you, sisters,<br />
					so as to illustrate the meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The flesh within,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for the six internal sense-fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The outer hide,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for the six external sense-fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The tendons, sinews and ligaments within,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for delight and attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The butcher's sharp knife,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for the Ariyan intuitive wisdom,<br />
					the Ariyan intuitive wisdom by which <a id="pg327"><span class="f2 g"><b>[327]</b></span></a> one cuts,<br />
					cuts around<br />
					and cuts all around<br />

					<p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, sisters, a monk develops the link in awakening<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Nandaka,<br />
					having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation,<br />
					dismissed them, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, sisters, it is time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the venerable Nandaka had said<br />
					and having given thanks,<br />
					rose from their seats,<br />
					greeted the venerable Nandaka<br />
					keeping their right sides towards him,<br />
					and approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to these nuns<br />
					as they were standing at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, nuns, it is time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping their right sides towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after these nuns had departed<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, as on an Observance day,<br />
					a fourteenth,<br />
					there is neither doubt nor perplexity among the populace<br />
					as to whether the moon is not full<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or whether the moon is full,<br />
					for the moon is then not full,<br />
					even so, monks,<br />
					although these nuns were delighted with Nandaka;'s teaching on <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					their aspirations were not fulfilled."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Nandaka, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well <a id="pg328"><span class="f2 g"><b>[328]</b></span></a> then, Nandaka,<br />
					you may exhort these nuns<br />
					with this same exhortation<br />
					again tomorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					the venerable Nandaka answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Nandaka dressed in the early morning<br />
					towards the end of that night and,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.<br />
					When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī,<br />
					on returning from the alms-gathering<br />
					after the meal<br />
					he approached the King's Monastery without a companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance,<br />
					and on seeing him they made ready a seat<br />
					and set out water for (washing) the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready<br />
					and as he was sitting down he washed his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when those nuns had greeted the venerable Nandaka<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Nandaka spoke thus to those nuns<br />
					as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sisters, there will be a talk by way of putting questions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who understand (each question) should say:<br />
					'We understand';<br />
					those who do not understand should say:<br />
					'We do not understand.'<br />
					But if anyone has any doubt or perplexity<br />
					I should be questioned about it thus:<br />
					'How is this, revered sir?<br />
					What is the meaning of that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So far, revered sir,<br />
					we are pleased and satisfied with the master Nandaka<br />
					in that the master Nandaka invites us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, sisters?<br />

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is what is impermanent, anguish<br />

					<p class="f4">"Anguish, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is right to regard that which is impermanent,<br />

					<p class="f4">he develops the link in awakening<br />

					and is dependent on aloofness,<br />

					that is equanimity<br />
					and is dependent on aloofness,<br />
					dependent on detachment,<br />

					<p class="f4">These, sisters, are the seven links in awakening<br />
					from the development and making much of which a monk,<br />

					by his own super-knowledge<br />
					the freedom of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Nandaka,<br />
					having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation,<br />
					dismissed them, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, sisters, it is time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the venerable Nandaka had said<br />
					and having given thanks,<br />
					rose from their seats,<br />
					greeted the venerable Nandaka<br />
					keeping their right sides towards him,<br />
					and approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to these nuns<br />
					as they were standing at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, nuns, it is time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping their right sides towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after these nuns had departed<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, as on an Observance day,<br />
					a fifteenth,<br />
					there is neither doubt nor perplexity among the populace<br />
					as to whether the moon is not full<br />
					or whether the moon is full,<br />
					for the moon is then quite full,<br />
					even so, monks, these nuns were delighted with Nandaka's teaching on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and their aspirations were fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">She who is the last nun<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> of these five hundred nuns is a stream-attainer,<br />
					not liable to the Downfall;<br />
					she is assured, bound for self-awakening."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
