					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid<br />
					with as many as five hundred nuns<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					she stood at a respectful distance.<br />
					As she was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					Mahāpajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, <span class="f3"><i>[323]</i></span> let the Lord exhort the nuns;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord instruct the nuns;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord make a talk on <i>Dhamma</i> for the nuns."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the monks who were elders used to exhort the nuns in turn;<br />
					but the venerable Nandaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> did not want to exhort the nuns in (his) turn.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					So the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, whose turn is it today to exhort the nuns by turn?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is Nandaka's turn, revered sir,<br />
					to exhort the nuns by turn;<br />
					but this venerable Nandaka, revered sir,<br />
					does not want to exhort the nuns in (his) turn."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Nandaka, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Exhort the nuns, Nandaka;<br />
					instruct the nuns, Nandaka;<br />
					do you, brahman,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> make a talk on <i>Dhamma</i> for the nuns."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir," <span class="f3"><b>[271]</b></span> answered the venerable Nandaka in assent to the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dressed in the early morning<br />
					and, taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.<br />
					When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī,<br />
					on returning from the alms-gathering after the meal<br />
					he approached the King's Monastery<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> without a companion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance,<br />
					and on seeing him they made ready a seat<br />
					and set out water for (washing) the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready<br />
					and as he was sitting down he washed his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when those nuns had greeted the venerable Nandaka<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Nandaka spoke thus to those nuns<br />
					as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sisters, there will be a talk by way of putting questions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who understand (each question) should say:<br />
					'We understand';<br />
					those who do not understand should say:<br />
					'We do not understand.'<br />
					<span class="f3"><i>[324]</i></span> But if anyone has any doubt or perplexity<br />
					I should be questioned about it thus:<br />
					'How is this, revered sir?<br />
					What is the meaning of that?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So far, revered sir, we are pleased and satisfied with the master Nandaka<br />
					in that the master Nandaka invites us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, sisters?<br />
					Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Impermanent, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is what is impermanent, anguish<br />
					or happiness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Anguish, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is right to regard that which is impermanent,<br />
					anguish and liable to alteration as,<br />
					'This is mine,<br />
					this am I,<br />
					this is my self.'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, sisters?<br />

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, sisters?<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, sisters, it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, sisters, like the oil for lighting an oil-lamp<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, sisters, it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is thus, sisters,<br />
					that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">It is, sisters, like the roots of a great, stable and pithy tree<br />

					<p class="f4">"Even so, sisters,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, sisters, it is good.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is thus, sisters,<br />
					that by means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">It is, sisters, as if a clever cattle-butcher<br />

					should dissect the cow with a butcher's sharp knife<br />
					without spoiling the flesh within,<br />
					without spoiling the outer hide,<br />

					<span class="f3"><b>[275]</b></span> and having cut,<br />

					cut all around<br />
					and removed the outer hide and,<br />
					having clothed that cow in that self-same hide again,<br />
					should then speak thus:<br />
					'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Speaking thus, sisters, would he be speaking rightly?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Although, revered sir, that clever cattle-butcher<br />

					should then speak thus:<br />
					'This cow is conjoined with this hide as before.'<br />
					yet that cow is not conjoined with that hide."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have made this simile for you, sisters,<br />
					so as to illustrate the meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The flesh within,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for the six internal sense-fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The outer hide,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for the six external sense-fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The tendons, sinews and ligaments within,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for delight and attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The butcher's sharp knife,' sisters,<br />
					is a synonym for the Ariyan intuitive wisdom,<br />
					the Ariyan intuitive wisdom by which <span class="f3"><i>[327]</i></span> one cuts,<br />
					cuts around<br />
					and cuts all around<br />
					the inner defilement's<br />
					the inner fetters<br />
					and the inner bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, sisters, these seven links in awakening<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to these nuns<br />

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />

					<p class="f4">Those nuns saw the venerable Nandaka coming in the distance,<br />

					<p class="f4">he develops the link in awakening<br />
					that is impassability<br />
					and is dependent on aloofness,<br />
					dependant on detachment,<br />
					dependant on cessation,<br />
					ending in abandoning;</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the link in awakening<br />
					that is concentration<br />
					and is dependent on aloofness,<br />
					dependant on detachment,<br />
					dependant on cessation,<br />
					ending in abandoning;</p>

					<p class="f4">he develops the link in awakening<br />
					that is equanimity<br />
					and is dependent on aloofness,<br />
					dependent on detachment,<br />
					dependent on cessation,<br />
					ending in abandoning.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, sisters, are the seven links in awakening<br />
					from the development and making much of which a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the cankers,<br />
					having here and now realized<br />
					by his own super-knowledge<br />
					the freedom of mind<br />
					and the freedom through intuitive wisdom<br />
					that are cankerless,<br />
					entering on them abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Nandaka,<br />
					having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation,<br />
					dismissed them, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, sisters, it is time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the venerable Nandaka had said<br />
					and having given thanks,<br />
					rose from their seats,<br />
					greeted the venerable Nandaka<br />
					keeping their right sides towards him,<br />
					and approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to these nuns<br />
					as they were standing at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go, nuns, it is time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these nuns,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping their right sides towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after these nuns had departed<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, as on an Observance day,<br />
					a fifteenth,<br />
					there is neither doubt nor perplexity among the populace<br />
					as to whether the moon is not full<br />
					or whether the moon is full,<br />
					for the moon is then quite full,<br />
					even so, monks, these nuns were delighted with Nandaka's teaching on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and their aspirations were fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">She who is the last nun<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> of these five hundred nuns is a stream-attainer,<br />
					not liable to the Downfall;<br />
					she is assured, bound for self-awakening."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> At <i>A.</i> i. 25 he is called foremost of those who exhort nuns. Verses at <i>Thag.</i> 279-282. <i>MA.</i> v. 93-94 says that in a former life he had been head of 500 slaves and Mahāpajāpatī of 500 women slaves, and they were husband and wife. In this life the women were born as her companions and went forth with her.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This was because in a previous birth he had been a king and they his concubines. He feared that anyone with recollection of former "habitations" would know this, and accuse him of wanting to see his former companions again.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> A term of high regard. The Buddha knew that only Nandaka could liberate the nuns.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup>Rājakārāma, built by Pasenadi to the south of the city, corresponding to the Thūpārāma, (at Anurādhapura), <i>MA.</i> v. 96. See <i>Jā.</i> ii. 15 and <i>D.P.P.N.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup><i>attadutiya,</i> with oneself for companion, <i>i.e.</i> alone; see <i>C.P.D.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> iii. 88. They are spoken of here according to <i>MA.</i> v. 96-97 because wisdom alone, without the seven links in awakening, is unable to cut off the defilements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>ūno chando, i.e..</i> one day less than full; the fifteenth being the day of the full moon.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The last of all in so far as excellent qualities, <i>guṇa,</i> are concerned is a stream-attainer; the others are once-returners, non-returners and those whose cankers are destroyed, <i>MA.</i> v. 97.</p>
