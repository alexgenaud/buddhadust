					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever fears arise, monks,<br />
					all arise for the fool,<br />
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever troubles<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> arise,<br />
					all arise for the fool,<br />
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever misfortunes arise,<br />
					all arise for the fool,<br />
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as a spark of fire<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from a house thatched with rushes<br />
					or a house thatched with grass<br />
					sets fire to gabled houses<br />
					that <a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> are smeared inside and out,<br />
					protected from the wind,<br />
					with bolts that are fastened,<br />
					windows that are closed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so, monks, whatever fears arise, monks,<br />
					all arise for the fool,<br />
					not the wise man;<br />
					whatever troubles arise,<br />
					all arise for the fool,<br />
					not the wise man;<br />
					whatever misfortunes arise,<br />
					all arise for the fool,<br />
					not the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, it is the fool<br />
					who is beset by fear,<br />
					the wise man is not beset by fear;<br />
					the fool has trouble,<br />
					the wise man does not have trouble;<br />
					the fool has misfortune,<br />
					the wise man does not have misfortune.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there is not fear,<br />
					trouble,<br />
					misfortune<br />
					for the wise man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Investigating,<br />
					we will become wise,'</p>

					<p class="f4">this is how you must train yourselves, monks."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the stage at which it suffices to say, revered sir:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Investigating, the monk is wise'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, as soon as a monk is skilled in the elements<br />
					and skilled in the (sense-)fields<br />
					and skilled in conditioned genesis<br />
					and skilled in the possible and the impossible,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it is at this stage, Ānanda,<br />
					that it suffices to say,<br />
					'Investigating, the monk is wise.'"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, revered sir, at what stage<br />
					does it suffice to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these eighteen elements,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">the element of eye,<br />
					the element of material shape,<br />

					<p class="f4">the element of ear,<br />
					the element of sound,<br />
					the element of auditory consciousness;</p>

					<p class="f4">the element of nose,<br />

					<p class="f4">the element of tongue,<br />

					<p class="f4">the element of body,<br />

					<p class="f4">the element of mind,<br />
					the element of mental states,<br />
					the element of mental consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these eighteen elements,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Might there be another way also, revered sir,<br />
					according to which it suffices to say,<br />
					'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There might be, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">the element of extension,<br />
					the element of cohesion,<br />

					<p class="f4">When, Ānanda, he knows and sees <a id="pg106"><span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span></a> these six elements,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Might there be another way also, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">"There might be, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">the element of happiness,<br />
					the element of anguish,<br />
					the element of gladness,<br />
					the element of sorrowing,<br />

					the element of Ignorance.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"There might be, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">the element of sensuous pleasures,<br />
					the element of renunciation,<br />
					the element of malice,<br />
					the element of non-malice,<br />
					the element of harming,<br />

					<p class="f4">"There might be, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three elements, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">the element of sensuous pleasures,<br />
					the element of fine-materiality,<br />
					the element of non-materiality.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Might there be another way, revered sir,<br />
					according to which it suffices to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is skilled in the elements'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There might be, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these two elements, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">the element that is constructed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the element that is unconstructed.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these two elements,<br />
					it is at this stage<br />
					that it suffices to say,<br />
					'The monk is skilled in the elements.'"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"At what stage, revered sir,<br />
					does it suffice to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is skilled in the (sense-)fields'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"These six (sense-)fields, Ānanda,<br />
					are internal-external:</p>

					<p class="f4">the eye <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> as well as material shape;<br />
					the ear as well as sound;<br />
					the nose as well as smell;<br />
					the tongue as well as taste;<br />
					the body as well as touch;<br />
					the mind as well as mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Ānanda, he knows and sees these six internal-external (sense-)fields,<br />
					it is at this stage<br />
					that it suffices to say,<br />
					'The monk is skilled in the (sense-)fields.'"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And at what stage, revered sir,<br />
					does it suffice to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is skilled in conditioned genesis'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Ānanda, a monk knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If this is,<br />
					that comes to be;<br />
					from the arising of this,<br />
					that arises;</p>

					<p class="f4">if this is not,<br />
					that does not come to be;<br />
					from the stopping of this,<br />
					that is stopped.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Conditioned by ignorance are the <i>(karma-)</i>formations;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					conditioned by the <i>(karma-)</i>formations is consciousness;<br />
					conditioned by consciousness is name-and-shape;<br />
					conditioned by name-and-shape is the field of the six (senses);<br />
					conditioned by the field of the six (senses) is (sensory) impingement;<br />
					conditioned by (sensory) impingement is feeling;<br />
					conditioned by feeling is craving;<br />
					conditioned by craving is grasping;<br />
					conditioned by grasping is becoming;<br />
					conditioned by becoming is birth;<br />
					conditioned by birth there come into being<br />
					old age and dying,<br />
					grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is the origin<br />
					of this whole mass of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the utter fading away and stopping<br />
					of this very ignorance<br />
					is the stopping of the <i>(karma-)</i>formations;<br />
					from the stopping of the <i>(karma-)</i>formations<br />
					is the stopping of consciousness;<br />
					from the stopping of consciousness<br />
					is the stopping of name-and-shape;<br />
					from the stopping of name-and-shape<br />

					from the stopping of the field of the six (senses)<br />
					is the stopping of (sensory) impingement;<br />
					from the stopping of (sensory) impingement<br />
					is the stopping of feeling;<br />
					from the stopping of feeling<br />
					is the stopping of craving;<br />
					from the stopping of craving<br />
					is the stopping of grasping;<br />
					from the stopping of grasping<br />

					old age and dying,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus is the stopping<br />
					of this whole mass of anguish.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is at that stage, Ānanda,<br />
					that it suffices to say,<br />
					'The monk is skilled in conditioned genesis.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And at what stage, revered sir,<br />
					does it suffice to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is skilled in the possible and the impossible'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Ānanda, a monk comprehends:</p>
