					in the brick hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila<br />
					were staying in a grove<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the Gosiŋga sāl-wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached that grove in the Gosiŋga sāl-wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">The keeper of the grove<br />
					saw the Lord coming from a distance;<br />
					and seeing him,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, recluse,<br />
					enter this grove;<br />
					there are three young men of family<br />
					staying here desiring Self;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					do not cause them discomfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Anuruddha heard the keeper of the grove<br />
					conferring with the Lord;<br />
					having heard,<br />
					he spoke thus to the keeper of the grove:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, good grove-keeper,<br />
					impede the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is our teacher,<br />
					the Lord,<br />
					who is arriving."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha approached<br />
					the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go forward, venerable ones,<br />
					go forward, venerable ones;<br />
					our teacher,<br />
					the Lord<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila,<br />
					having gone out to meet the Lord,<br />
					one received his bowl and robe,<br />
					one made ready a seat,<br />
					one set out water for (washing) the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord sat down<br />

					<p class="f4">"I hope that things are going well with you, Anuruddhas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"I hope that you, Anuruddhas,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, certainly, Lord,<br />
					we are living all together on friendly terms<br />

					<p class="f4">"And how is it that you, Anuruddhas,<br />
					are living all together on friendly terms<br />

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Lord, it occurred to me:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Because of this, Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, suppose that I,<br />

					<p class="f4">So I, Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Nandiya too spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Kimbila too spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus it is that we, Lord,<br />
