					<p class="f4">"Very well, revered sir,"<br />

					having greeted Nātaputta the Jain<br />
					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is not the right time today<br />

					but tomorrow I,<br />
					in my own house,<br />
					will refute the Lord,"<br />

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, may the Lord consent<br />
					to take a meal with me on the morrow<br />
					with three others?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya,<br />
					having understood the lord's consent,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					at the end of that night,<br />
					having dressed in the early morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached Prince Abhaya's dwelling;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Abhaya<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served and satisfied the Lord<br />
					with sumptuous solid and soft <a id="pg62"><span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span></a> foods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the Lord had eaten<br />
					and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br />
					Prince Abhaya, taking a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prince Abhaya, sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br />
					could a Tathāgata utter a speech disliked by others,<br />
					disagreeable to them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is not this one-sided,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> Prince?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"At this point, revered sir,<br />
					the Jains have lost."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Why do you speak thus, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt394" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg394"><span class="f2">[394]</span></a> 'At this point, revered sir, the Jains have lost'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, I, revered sir, approached Nātaputta the Jain;<br />

					<p class="f4">Nātaputta the Jain spoke thus to me, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">At that time an innocent little baby boy<br />
					was lying on its back<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on Prince Abhaya's knees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Prince Abhaya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What <a id="pt395" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg395"><span class="f2">[395]</span></a> do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">If this boy<br />
					owing to your carelessness<br />
					or that of his nurse<br />
					were to put a stick or stone into his mouth,<br />
					what would you do for him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would get it out, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if I, revered sir,<br />
					were not able to get it out at once,<br />
					then taking hold of his head with my left hand,<br />
					crooking a finger,<br />
					I would get it out with my right hand,<br />
					even though it were with blood.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, I have compassion for the boy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br />
					whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be not fact,<br />
					not true,<br />
					not connected with the goal,<br />
					and that is not liked by others,<br />
					disagreeable to them,<br />
					that speech the Tathāgata does not utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech a Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br />
					true,<br />
					but not connected with the goal,<br />
					and not liked by others,<br />
					disagree- <a id="pg63"><span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span></a> able to them,<br />
					neither does the Tathāgata utter that speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br />
					true,<br />
					connected with the goal,<br />
					but not liked by others,<br />
					disagreeable to them,<br />
					the Tathāgata is aware of the right time<br />
					for explaining that speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be not fact,<br />
					not true,<br />
					not connected with the goal,<br />
					but that is liked by others,<br />

					<p class="f4">And whatever speech the Tathāgata knows to be fact,<br />

					and liked by others,<br />
					agreeable to them,<br />
					the Tathāgata is aware of the right time<br />
					for explaining that speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, Prince, that the Tathāgata has compassion for creatures."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, if those who are learned nobles<br />
					and learned brahmans<br />
					and learned householders<br />
					and learned recluses<br />
					approach the Tathāgata<br />
					and ask him a question they have constructed -<br />
					has the Lord already reflected in his mind on this,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whoever, having approached me,<br />
					questions me like this,<br />
					then, asked thus,<br />
					I will answer them thus,<br />
					or does (the answer) occur to a Tathāgata immediately?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Prince,<br />
					I will ask you a question in return.</p>

					<p class="f4">As it may please you,<br />
					so may you answer it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you skilled in the various parts of a chariot?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,<br />
					I am skilled in the various parts of a chariot."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">If those who have approached you<br />
					should ask thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the name<br />
					of this particular part of the chariot?'</p>

					<p class="f4">would you have already <a id="pt396" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg396"><span class="f2">[396]</span></a> reflected on this in your mind,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If those who have approached me<br />
					should ask thus,<br />
					then I will answer them thus,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or would (the answer) occur to you immediately?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, revered sir,<br />
					I am a renowned charioteer,<br />
					skilled in the various parts of a chariot,<br />
					all the particular parts of a chariot<br />
					are fully known to me,<br />
					so (the answer) would occur to me immediately."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br />
					if those who are learned nobles<br />
					and learned brahmans<br />
					and learned householders<br />
					and learned recluses<br />
					approach the Tathāgata<br />
					and ask him a question they have constructed,<br />
					(the answer) occurs to the Tathāgata immediately.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason <a id="pg64"><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></a> for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, Prince, that the constitution of <i>Dhamma</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is fully penetrated by the Tathāgata,<br />
					and because of his full penetration<br />
					of the constitution of <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					(the answer) occurs to the Tathāgata immediately."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Prince Abhaya spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent, revered sir,<br />
					it is excellent, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the Lord for refuge,<br />
					and to <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Lord accept me<br />
					as a lay-follower,<br />
					one gone for refuge from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

Certainly the Hell, for Devadatta, endures as long as the <i>kalpa,</i> but the <i>kalpa,</i> as in Hindu philosophy, is regarded as subject to "involution," absorption, rest, before it evolves or manifests again - and endlessly again.
