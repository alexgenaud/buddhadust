					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>samayavimokkha.</i> This is probably a release both as to things that are worldly, mundane and temporal, and as to what is passing or temporary in its nature. As such it is of a less high order than <i>asamayavimokkha,</i> below, from which there is no falling away, for it is "unshakable." <i>MA.</i> ii. 232, quoting <i>Pts.</i> ii. 40 says this is the four ways, the four fruits and <i>nibbāna</i>; while <i>samayavimokkha</i> is the four meditations and the four attainments in immateriality. <i>Vimokkha</i> may have an objective reference to the things one is freed from; while <i>vimutti</i> may be the subjective experience of (mental) freedom. It is curious that the preliminaries to attaining <i>samayavimokkha</i> and <i>asamayavimokkha</i> appear to be identical. This may be due either to some error on the part of a scribe or transcriber, or to some lacuna in the text. For this passage, speaking of ever greater and greater powers won by a monk, may have intended to show that <i>asamayavimokkha</i> was a higher achievement than <i>samayavimokkha.</i></p>
