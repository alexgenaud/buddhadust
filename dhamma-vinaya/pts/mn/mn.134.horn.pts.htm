					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Lomasakaŋgiyai<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was staying among the Sakyans<br />
					near Kapilavatthu<br />
					in Nigrodha's park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night was far spent,<br />
					the <i>deva</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Candana,<br />
					illumining with his radiant beauty<br />

					and having approached,<br />
					he stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at one side<br />
					the deva Candana spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Lomasakaŋgiyai:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, monk, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, do not remember<br />

					<p class="f4">But do you, friend, remember<br />

					and the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I too, monk, do not remember<br />
					either the exposition<br />
					or the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious.</p>

					<p class="f4">But do you, monk, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, do not remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"But how is it<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> that you, friend, remember<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg246"><span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span></a> "At this one time, monk,<br />
					the Lord was staying among the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three<br />

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the Lord spoke the exposition<br />

					to the <i>devas</i> of the Thirty-Three:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The past should not be followed after, the future not desired.<br />

							Thus abiding ardently, unwearied day and night,<br />
							He indeed is 'Auspicious' called, described as a sage at peace."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is that I, monk, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Lomasakaŋgiyai<br />
					towards the end of that night,<br />
					having packed away his lodging,<br />
					set out on tour for Sāvatthī,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking on tour,<br />
					he gradually approached Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery<br />
					and the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a <a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a> respectful distance<br />
					the venerable Lomasakaŋgiyai spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At this one time, revered sir,<br />

					and having approached,<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at one side<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, monk, remember the verses of the Auspicious."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how is it that you, friend, remember<br />
					the verses of the Auspicious?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"At this one time, monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the deva;<br />

					he disappeared then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good, revered sir,<br />
					if the Lord were to teach me<br />
					the exposition<br />

					<p class="f4">"But do you, monk, know this deva?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, do not know that deva."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This deva, monk, is called Candana.</p>

					<p class="f4">The deva Candana, monk,<br />
					having applied himself,<br />
					having attended,<br />
					and having concentrated all his mind,<br />
					listened to <i>dhamma</i> with ready ears.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, do you, monk,<br />
					listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					the venerable Lomasakaŋgiyai answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The past should not be followed after, the future not desired.<br />
							What is past is got rid of and the future has not come.<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, monk, does one follow after the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks: 'Such was my material shape in the distant past'<br />

					He thinks: 'Such was my feeling in the distant past'<br />

					The Fourth</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 6 says this Elder's name was Aŋga, but as he had only a little down on his body he was known as Lomasakaŋgiyai. His verse is at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p27"><i>Thag.</i> 27,</a> and the story of how in a former life he wanted to recite the Bhadd'Eka-Ratta occurs at <i>ThagA.</i> i. 89 <i>f.</i> See <i>Ap.</i> ii. 504 <i>f.</i>, where the story, both of the past and the present, differs in various details.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> devaputta. As such he was known by the same name, Candana, as he had had as a rich <i>upasaka</i> in the time of the Buddha Kassapa, <i>MA.</i> v. 7. See <i>M.L.S.</i> i. 183.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>yathākathaṁ dhāresi.</i> This might also be translated as "do you remember according to what had been said," <i>i.e.</i> do you remember the verses on the Auspicious according to how they were spoken? It would, indeed, be important to know the verses exactly as they had been spoken for, as the sequel states, they are connected with the goal. The above rendering may be justified however since the following sentences appear to be an answer to a question in such a form. <i>Cf.</i> <i>yathākathaṁ sandassesi,</i> etc., at <i>M.</i> iii. 190 above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>paṇḍukambalasīla,</i> usually the name of Sakka's throne. <i>Paṇḍukambala</i> is a light red woollen blanket, in this case the colour of a heap of <i>jayasumara</i> (Victory's joy) flowers. According to <i>MA.</i> v. 7 the Buddha went to the abode of the Thirty-Three seven years after the Enlightenment and after he had performed the twin miracle, and stayed there for a year.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Sitting down in silence while hearing it means "he learns," <i>MA.</i> v. 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Rehearsing it out loud means "he masters it."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Speaking it to others means "he remembers it."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> 1. 326, which see for further references.</p>
