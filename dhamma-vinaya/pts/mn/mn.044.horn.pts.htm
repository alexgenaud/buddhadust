					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the layfollower Visākha<br />
					approached the nun Dhammadinnā;;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the nun Dhammadinnā,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the lay follower Visākha spoke thus<br />
					to the nun Dhammadinnā:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Own body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					own body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br />
					'own body'<br />
					by the Lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					these five groups of grasping<br />
					are called 'own body' by the Lord,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the group of grasping after material shape,<br />
					the group of grasping after feeling,<br />
					the group of grasping after perception,<br />
					the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,<br />
					the group of grasping after consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five groups of grasping, friend Visākha,<br />
					are called 'own body' by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg361"><span class="f2 g"><b>[361]</b></span></a> "It is good, lady,"<br />
					and the lay follower Visākha,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the nun Dhammadinnā had said,<br />
					having thanked her,<br />
					asked the nun Dhammadinnā a further question:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The uprising of own body,<br />
					the uprising of own body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br />
					'the uprising of own body'<br />
					by the Lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, friend Visākha,<br />
					is the craving<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					connected with again-becoming,<br />
					accompanied by delight and attachment,<br />
					finding delight in this and that,<br />
					namely the craving for sense-pleasures,<br />
					the craving for becoming,<br />
					the craving for annihilation,<br />
					this, friend Visākha,<br />
					is called 'the uprising of own body' by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The stopping of own body,<br />
					the stopping of own body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br />
					'stopping of own body'<br />
					by the Lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, friend Visākha,vis the stopping,<br />
					with no attachment remaining,<br />
					of that self-same craving,<br />
					the giving up of it,<br />
					the renunciation of it,<br />
					the release from it,<br />
					the doing away with it,<br />
					this, friend Visākha,<br />
					is called 'The stopping of own body' by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lady, it is said,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The course leading to the stopping of own body,<br />
					the course leading to the stopping of own body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lady, what is called<br />
					'the course leading to the stopping of own body'<br />
					by the Lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This ariyan eightfold Way itself, friend Visākha,<br />
					is called 'the course leading to the stopping of own body' by the Lord,<br />
					that is to say perfect view,<br />
					perfect thought,<br />
					perfect speech,<br />
					perfect action,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do those five groups of grasping, lady,<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, friend Visākha,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatever, friend Visākha,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But how, lady,<br />

					<p class="f4">"In this case, friend Visākha,<br />

					<p class="f4">he regards feeling as self<br />
					or self as having feeling<br />

					<p class="f4">he regards perception as self<br />

					or self as in habitual tendencies;</p>

					<p class="f4">he regards consciousness, as self<br />
					or self as having consciousness<br />
					or consciousness as in self<br />
					or self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, friend Visākha, does there come to be<br />
					(wrong) view as to own body."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, lady, does there not come to be<br />
					(wrong) view as to own body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, friend Visākha,<br />
					an instructed disciple of the pure ones,<br />
					taking count of the pure ones,<br />
					skilled in the <i>dhamma</i> of the pure ones,<br />
					well trained in the <i>dhamma</i> of the pure ones,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But what, lady, is the ariyan eightfold Way?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friend Visākha, is the ariyan eightfold Way,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					perfect view,<br />
					perfect thought,<br />
					perfect speech,<br />
					perfect action,<br />
					perfect way of living,<br />
					perfect endeavour,<br />
					perfect mindfulness,<br />
					perfect concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, is the ariyan eightfold Way composite<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or in-composite?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ariyan eightfold Way, friend Visākha,<br />
					is composite."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, lady, are the three classes<br />
					arranged in accordance with <a id="pg363"><span class="f2 g"><b>[363]</b></span></a> the ariyan eightfold Way<br />
					or is the ariyan eightfold Way<br />
					arranged in accordance with the three classes?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha, the three classes<br />
					are not arranged in accordance with the ariyan eightfold Way,<br />
					but the ariyan eightfold Way<br />
					is arranged in accordance with the three classes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, friend Visākha,<br />
					is perfect speech<br />
					and whatever is perfect action<br />
					and whatever is perfect way of living -<br />
					these things are arranged<br />
					in the class of Moral Habit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever is perfect endeavour<br />
					and whatever is perfect mindfulness<br />
					and whatever is perfect concentration -<br />
					these things are arranged<br />
					in the class of Concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever is perfect view<br />
					and whatever is perfect thought -<br />
					these things are arranged<br />
					in the class of Intuitive Wisdom."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, lady, is concentration,<br />
					what are the distinguishing marks of concentration,<br />
					what are the requisites for concentration,<br />
					what is the development of concentration?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever, friend Visākha,<br />
					is one-pointedness of mind,<br />
					this is concentration;<br />
					the four arousings of mindfulness<br />
					are the distinguishing marks of concentration;<br />
					the four right efforts<br />
					are the requisites for concentration;<br />
					whatever is the practice,<br />
					the development,<br />
					the increase of<br />
					these very things,<br />
					this is herein the development of concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how many activities<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> are there,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> lady?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three activities, friend Visākha:<br />
					activities of body,<br />
					activities of speech,<br />
					activities of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, lady, is activity of body,<br />
					what activity of speech,<br />
					what activity of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In-breathing and out-breathing, friend Visākha,<br />
					is activity of body;<br />
					initial thought and discursive thought<br />
					is activity of speech;<br />
					perception and feeling is activity of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why, lady, is in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					activity of body,<br />
					why is initial thought and discursive thought<br />
					activity of speech,<br />
					why is perception and why is feeling<br />
					activity of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In-breathing and out-breathing, friend Visākha -<br />
					these are bodily things<br />
					dependent on the body,<br />
					therefore in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					is activity of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having first had initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					one subsequently utters a speech,<br />
					therefore initial and discursive thought<br />
					is activity of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception and feeling -<br />
					these are mental things,<br />
					dependent on mind,<br />
					therefore perception and feeling<br />
					is (each) activity of mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, lady, does there come to be<br />
					the attainment of the stopping of perception and feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					it does not occur to a monk<br />
					who is attaining the stopping of perception and feeling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will attain<br />
					the stopping of perception and feeling,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am attaining<br />
					the stopping of perception and feeling,'</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have attained<br />
					the stopping of perception and feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For, his mind has been previously so developed in that way<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that it leads him on to the state of being such."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, when a monk is attaining<br />
					the stopping of perception and feeling,<br />
					what things are stopped first:<br />
					activity of body<br />
					or activity of speech<br />
					or activity of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha, when a monk is attaining<br />
					the stopping of perception and feeling,<br />
					activity of speech is stopped first,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					then activity of body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					then activity of mind."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, lady, does there come to be<br />
					emergence from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					it does not occur to a monk<br />
					who is emerging from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will emerge<br />
					from the attainment of the stopping of perception and feeling,</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am emerging<br />

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">I have emerged<br />
					from the attainment of the stopping of perception and feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For his mind has been previously so developed in that way<br />
					that it leads him on to the state of being such."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, when a monk is emerging from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling,<br />
					what things arise first:<br />
					activity of body<br />
					or activity of speech<br />
					or activity of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					when a monk is emerging from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling,<br />
					activity of mind arises first,<br />
					then activity of body,<br />
					then activity of speech."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lady, how many impingements<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> assail a monk<br />
					who has emerged from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					when a monk has emerged from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling<br />
					three impingements assail him:<br />
					impingement that is void,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					impingement that is signless,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					impingement that is undirected."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"When, lady, the mind of a monk has emerged<br />
					from the attainment of the stopping of perception and feeling,<br />
					towards what does his mind tend,<br />
					slide<br />
					and gravitate?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha, the mind of a monk who has emerged from the attainment<br />
					of the stopping of perception and feeling<br />
					tends,<br />
					slides<br />
					and gravitates towards aloofness."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"How many feelings are there, lady?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these three feelings, friend Visākha:<br />
					Feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					feeling that is painful,<br />
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, lady, is feeling that is pleasant,<br />
					what feeling that is painful,<br />
					what feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, friend Visākha, which is experienced,<br />
					whether by body or mind,<br />
					and is pleasant and agreeable,<br />
					this is a pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, friend Visākha, which is experienced,<br />
					whether by body or mind,<br />
					and is painful and disagreeable,<br />
					this is a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, friend Visākha, which is experienced,<br />
					whether by body or mind,<br />
					and is neither agreeable nor disagreeable,<br />
					this is a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, how is pleasant feeling pleasant,<br />
					how painful?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is painful feeling painful,<br />
					how pleasant?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is neutral feeling pleasant,<br />
					how painful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					pleasant feeling is that where pleasantness is lasting,<br />
					pain variable;<br />
					painful feeling is that where pain is lasting,<br />
					<a id="pg366"><span class="f2 g"><b>[366]</b></span></a> pleasantness variable;<br />
					neutral feeling is pleasant as to knowing,<br />
					painful as to not knowing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, what tendency lies latent in pleasant feeling,<br />
					what tendency lies latent in painful feeling,<br />
					what tendency lies latent in neutral feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					a tendency to attachment<br />
					lies latent in pleasant feeling;<br />
					a tendency to repugnance<br />
					lies latent in painful feeling;<br />
					a tendency to ignorance<br />
					lies latent in a neutral feeling."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, does a tendency to attachment<br />
					lie latent in all pleasant feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does a tendency to repugnance<br />
					lie latent in all painful feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does a tendency to ignorance<br />
					lie latent in all neutral feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visākha,<br />
					a tendency to attachment<br />
					does not lie latent in all pleasant feeling,<br />
					a tendency to repugnance<br />
					does not lie latent in all painful feeling,<br />
					a tendency to ignorance<br />
					does not lie latent in all neutral feeling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, what is to be got rid of<br />
					in pleasant feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is to be got rid of<br />
					in painful feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is to be got rid of<br />
					in neutral feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"A tendency to attachment, friend Visākha,<br />
					is to be got rid of<br />
					in pleasant feeling;<br />
					a tendency to repugnance<br />
					is to be got rid of<br />
					in painful feeling;<br />
					a tendency to ignorance<br />
					is to be got rid of<br />
					in neutral feeling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, lady, is a tendency to attachment<br />
					to be got rid of<br />
					from every pleasant feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is a tendency to repugnance<br />
					to be got rid of<br />
					from every painful feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is a tendency to ignorance<br />
					to be got rid of<br />
					from every neutral feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend Visākha,<br />
					a tendency to attachment<br />
					is not to be got rid of<br />
					from every pleasant feeling,<br />
					a tendency to repugnance<br />
					is not to be got rid of<br />
					from every painful feeling,<br />
					a tendency to ignorance<br />
					is not to be got rid of<br />
					from every neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, friend Visākha,<br />
					a monk,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters on and abides in the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by<br />
					initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by this means<br />
					that he gets rid of attachment,<br />
					no tendency to attachment<br />
					lies latent there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, friend Visākha,<br />
					a monk reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely I,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					will abide<br />
					in that plane which the ariyans,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are now abiding in.'</p>

					<p class="f4">From setting up a <a id="pg367"><span class="f2 g"><b>[367]</b></span></a> yearning<br />
					for the incomparable Deliverances<br />
					there arises, as a result of the yearning,<br />
					distress;<br />
					it is by this means that he gets rid of repugnance,<br />
					no tendency to repugnance<br />
					lies latent there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, friend Visākha,<br />
					a monk,<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					and by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters on and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
