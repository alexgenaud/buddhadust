					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This Discourse, an exposition of heretical views, should be read in conjunction with the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Brahmajāla-Suttanta</a> (to which the <i>Comy.</i> refers) and also with the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">Mahānidāna-Suttanta</a> §23 <i>et seq.</i> (D. Stas. Nos. 1 and 15.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 5: recluses because they have gone forth, brahmans by birth; or, they are called "recluses" and "brahmans" by the world. So <i>samaṇa-brāhmaṇā</i> should be translated either "recluses and brahmans" or "brahman recluses." But since the phrase <i>samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā</i> is found later in the Sta., I have chosen the former rendering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>aparantakappika,</i> or, "supposing there is a future." On the two <i>kappas</i> of craving, <i>taṇhā,</i> and views, <i>diṭṭhi,</i> see <i>Nd.</i> I. 112-113. The former is associated with thoughts of "mine," the latter with false views about one's own body (see below, p. 19), other false views and with taking up extreme views. <i>Cf.</i> <i>D.</i> i. 30 <i>f.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> As at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#pg30"><i>D.</i> i. 30,</a> which adds "on forty-four grounds."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> In sixteen ways, <i>MA.</i> iv. 16. For these see <i>D.</i> i. 31.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>aroga,</i> not ill, hale, healthy; but <i>MA.</i> iv. 16, <i>DA.</i> 119 give <i>nicca,</i> enduring, permanent. Rhys Davids, at <i>Dial.</i> i. 44 <i>ff.,</i> translated as "not subject to decay."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>saññin,</i> is perceptive, perceiving. I keep to this rather than to "consciousness" which Rhys Davids uses, because I use "perception" for <i>saññā</i> (as one of the <i>khandha</i>) and "consciousness" for <i>viññāṇa</i> (also a <i>khandha,</i> etc.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> In eight ways, <i>MA.</i> iv. 16. For these see <i>D.</i> i. 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Also in eight ways, <i>MA.</i> iv. 16. For these see <i>D.</i> i. 33.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> On seven grounds, see <i>D.</i> i. 34-35. <i>Brhad. Up.</i> II. 4. 12-14 states the problem of consciousness, <i>vijñāna,</i> and the lack of it, in a clear manner. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Kaṭha Up.</i> I. 1. 20: "there is doubt about a man who has 'departed,' <i>prete,</i> some saying he is and others that he is not," and see Radhakrishnan, <i>The Principal Upanishads,</i> p. 603.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> As at <i>D.</i> i. 34; on seven grounds. <i>MA.</i> iv. 16, <i>DA.</i> 120 say that these three terms are synonymous, but they gloss <i>vināsa</i> by <i>adassana</i> and <i>vibhava</i> by <i>bhavavigama.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> i. 140, where this thesis was wrongly ascribed to Gotama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> On five grounds. See <i>D.</i> i. 36. <i>MA.</i> iv. 17, <i>DA.</i> 121 say that this is the allaying of anguish in this very existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>santaṁ,</i> <i>i.e.</i> in reference to the three modes of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> See <i>D.</i> i. 31. <i>MA.</i> iv. 18, <i>DA.</i> 119 appear to refer this to the <i>samāpatti,</i> the nine meditative attainments, while "diversity" or multiformity is incomplete attainment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>DA.</i> 119 refers "limited," the small, <i>paritta,</i> and "the immeasurable" to the <i>kasiṇa</i>-devices.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>viññāṇakasiṇa.</i> See <i>M.</i> ii. 14-15, <i>A.</i> v. 60, where each of the ten "devices" is to be understood in five ways, the fifth way being as "immeasurable."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> This refers to the fourth <i>jhānu.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Expos.</i> i. 210 <i>ff.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> This refers to the planes of infinite <i>ākāsa</i> and infinite consciousness, <i>MA.</i> iv. 18. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Expos.</i> i. 269 <i>ff.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> At <i>A.</i> v. 63, according to the perception of some beings this is the topmost perception.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 19 says that all this - perception together with views - is constructed and formed by the coming together of conditions, <i>paccaya.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>oḷārika,</i> material, gross, coarse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>saṁkhārā,</i> or activities. This is nibbāna, according to <i>MA.</i> iv. 19. At <i>S.</i> iv. 217 the stopping of the <i>saṁkhārā,</i> is spoken of as gradual. See <i>M.L.S.</i> i. Intr., p. xxiv.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> from the compounded. On the stopping of whatever is the compounded being the escape from it, see <i>D.</i> iii. 275, <i>Iti.</i> p. 61, and <i>cf.</i> <i>Iti.</i> p. 37, <i>Ud.</i> 80.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 25 says that up to here the 62 views have been handed down in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">Brahmajāla</a>: the four eternalist views, the four partial-eternalist, the four about "end" and "no end," the four eel-wrigglings, the two concerned with "attainment," the sixteen views on the "perceiving" person, the eight on the non-perceiving person, the eight on the person who neither perceives nor does not perceive, the seven annihilationist views, and the five views of nibbāna here and now. But in this Discourse (i.e. <i>M.</i> Sta. 102) views of "own body" are also spoken of (see above, p. 19).</p>
