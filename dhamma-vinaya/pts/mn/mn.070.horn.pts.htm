					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was walking on tour in Kāsi together with a large Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, monks, do not eat a meal at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not eating a meal at night,<br />
					I, monks, am aware of good health<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, do you too, monks, not eat a meal at <a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not eating a meal at night, you too, monks,<br />
					will be aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, walking on tour in Kāsi,<br />
					in due course arrived at Kīṭāgiri,<br />
					a market town in Kāsi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord stayed at Kīṭāgiri,<br />
					the market town in Kāsi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the monks named Assaji and Punabbasuka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					were residing in Kīṭāgiri.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then several monks approached the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka;<br />
					having approached, they spoke thus to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord, your reverences, does not eat a meal at night,<br />
					nor does the Order of monks;<br />
					and because, your reverences, they do not eat a meal at night<br />
					they are aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, do you too, your reverences,<br />
					not eat a meal at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not eating a meal at night, you too, your reverences,<br />
					will be aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka spoke thus to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We, your reverences,<br />
					eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But although we eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time -<br />
					we are aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should we,<br />
					giving up the things of the present,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					run after those of the future?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">We will eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time."</p>

					<p class="f4">So because these monks were unable to convince the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka,<br />
					they approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now we, revered sir,<br />
					approached the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					we spoke thus to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord, your reverences, does not eat a meal at night,<br />
					nor does the Order of monks;<br />
					and because, your reverences, they do not eat a meal at night<br />
					they are aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, do you too, your reverences,<br />
					not eat a meal at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not eating a meal at night, you too, your reverences,<br />
					will be aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka spoke thus to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We, your reverences,<br />
					eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">But although we eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time -<br />
					we are aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should we,<br />
					giving up the things of the present,<br />
					run after those of the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">We will eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because we, revered sir,<br />
					were not able to convince the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka<br />
					that we are telling this matter to the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord summoned a certain monk, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, monk,<br />
					in my name summon the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					and this monk, having answered the Lord in assent,<br />
					approached the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					and the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka, having answered that monk in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as is said, monks,<br />
					that several monks, having approached you, spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord, your reverences, does not eat a meal at night,<br />
					nor does the Order of monks;<br />
					and because, your reverences, they do not eat a meal at night<br />
					they are aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, do you too, your reverences,<br />
					not eat a meal at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not eating a meal at night, you too, your reverences,<br />
					will be aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">It is said that when this had been said, monks,<br />
					you spoke thus to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We, your reverences,<br />
					eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">But although we eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time -<br />
					we are aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should we,<br />
					giving up the things of the present,<br />
					run after those of the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">We will eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time."<br />
					"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Did you, monks, ever understand<br />
					that <i>dhamma</i> was taught thus by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever an individual experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant or <a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> painful or neither painful nor pleasant -<br />
					unskilled states decline in him,<br />
					skilled states grow much?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Did not you, monks, understand that <i>dhamma</i> was taught thus by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">For anyone here feeling a pleasant feeling of one kind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					that there is something to be done through diligence;<br />
					yet, I, monks, do not say of all monks<br />
					that there is not something to be done through diligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, those monks who are perfected ones,<br />
					canker-waned,<br />
					who have lived the life,<br />
					done what there was to be done,<br />
					laid down the burden,<br />
					who have attained their own goal,<br />
					the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed,<br />
					who are freed by right profound knowledge,<br />
					of monks such as these I do not say, monks,<br />
					that there is something to be done through diligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It has (already) been done <a id="pg151"><span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></a> by these through diligence,<br />
					these could not become negligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even while these venerable ones are resorting to suitable lodgings,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 193 says that "he goes near (or, into the presence of) a teacher." The following passage also occurs at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg173"><i>M.</i> ii. 173.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>payirupāsati,</i> can also mean to pay respects to someone, to visit someone. <i>MA.</i> iii, 193 = 426 says "he sits down in the presence of," santike. <i>Cf.</i> <i>AA.</i> ii.	196.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> <i>chanda. MA.</i> iii. 193 calls this desire for what is skilled, <i>kusalachanda</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> Here, according to <i>MA.</i> iii. 194: "The Lord knows the advantages in eating only once a day; I do not. But, because of my faith, I will eat only one meal a day, giving up eating three times daily."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 194 says that thus the application to the skin, sinews, bones, and the flesh and blood constitutes a fourfold energy. But the "fourfold exposition" is more likely to refer to the disciple who has faith. Nor is there anything here about the four truths (<i>MA.</i> iii. 193).</p>
