					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman Jāṇussoṇi was leaving Sāvatthī early in the day<br />
					in an all-white chariot<br />
					(drawn by) mares.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Jāṇussoṇi saw the wanderer Pilotika<br />
					coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he spoke thus to the wanderer Pilotika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, where is the revered Vacchāyana<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> coming from<br />
					so early in the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, sir, am coming from the presence<br />
					of the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Vacchāyana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the recluse Gotama lucidity of wisdom?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think him clever?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who am I, sir,<br />
					that I would know<br />
					whether the recluse Gotama has lucidity of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely only one like him<br />
					could know whether the recluse Gotama<br />
					has lucidity of wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Undoubtedly it is with lofty praise<br />
					that the revered Vacchāyana praises<br />
					the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who am I, sir,<br />
					that I should praise the recluse Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">Praised by the praised<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is the revered Gotama,<br />
					chief among devas and men."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what good thing<br />
					does the revered Vacchāyana see<br />
					that he has this high confidence<br />
					in the recluse Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, as a skilled elephant-tracker<br />
					might enter an elephant-forest,<br />
					and might see in the elephant-forest<br />
					a great footprint,<br />
					long and broad;<br />
					he might come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it is a <a id="pg221"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span></a> great elephant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so did I, sir, when I had seen<br />
					the four footprints of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					come to this conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">The fully Self-awakened One is the Lord;<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord;<br />
					the Order is faring along well.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, sir, I see some clever nobles,<br />
					subtle,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					practised in disputing with others,<br />
					skilled in hair-splitting,<br />
					who go about, methinks,<br />
					breaking to pieces<br />
					in their wisdom<br />
					the views (of others).</p>

					<p class="f4">These hear:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Undoubtedly the recluse Gotama<br />
					will visit a certain village<br />
					or little town.</p>

					<p class="f4">They construct a question,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Having approached the recluse Gotama,<br />
					we will ask him this question of ours.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on being asked by us thus,<br />

					<p class="f4">'It is certain that the recluse Gotama<br />

					<p class="f4">So they approached the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />

					with talk on <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">These,<br />
					gladdened,<br />

					did not ask the recluse Gotama the question at all -<br />
					whence could they refute him?</p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary<br />
					they became disciples of the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I, sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">On the contrary,<br />

					from home into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama let them go forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, gone forth like this,<br />

					aloof,<br />
					diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					having by their own super-knowledge<br />
					soon realised here and now<br />
					that goal of the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					abided in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">These speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed we were nearly lost,<br />
					indeed we nearly perished,<br />
					for while formerly we were not (true) recluses,<br />
					we claimed that we were,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are recluses";</p>

					<p class="f4">not being (true) brahmans,<br />
					we claimed that we were,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are brahmans";</p>

					<p class="f4">not being (true) perfected ones,<br />
					we claimed that we were,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are perfected ones".</p>

					<p class="f4">But now we really are recluses,<br />
					now we really are brahmans,<br />
					now we really are perfected ones.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I, sir,<br />
					saw this fourth footprint of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					then I came to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fully Self-awakened One is the Lord;<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord;<br />
					the Order fares along well.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Jāṇussoṇi the brahman got down from his all-white chariot<br />
					(drawn by) mares,<br />
					and having arranged his outer cloak over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted the Lord three times with joined palms,<br />
					he uttered this utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverence to this Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-awakened One;</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverence to this Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-awakened One;</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverence to this Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps we,<br />
					somewhere,<br />
					sometime<br />
					will meet the honoured Gotama;<br />
					perhaps there may be some conversation."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Jāṇussoṇi the brahman approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Jāṇussoṇi the brahman<br />
					related to the Lord<br />
					all the conversation he had had up till now<br />
					with the wanderer Pilotika.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to Jāṇussoṇi the brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, to a (certain) extent<br />
					the simile of the elephant's <a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> footprints<br />
					is not complete in all its detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, brahman,<br />
					to the extent to which the simile of the elephant's footprints<br />
					is complete in all its detail,<br />
					listen,<br />
					pay careful attention<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered one,"<br />
					Jāṇussoṇi the brahman answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, an elephant tracker<br />
					might enter an elephant forest,<br />
					and might see in the elephant forest<br />
					a large footprint,<br />
					long and broad.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a skilled elephant tracker<br />
					does not at once<br />
					come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is a great bull-elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, brahman,<br />
					in an elephant forest<br />
					stunted she-elephants<br />
					who have large footprints,<br />
					and he thinks<br />
					this might be a footprint of theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows them<br />
					and following them<br />
					he sees in the elephant forest<br />
					a great footprint,<br />
					long and broad,<br />
					and a grazing off of the high things.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A skilled elephant tracker<br />
					does not at once come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is a great bull-elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, brahman,<br />
					in an elephant forest<br />
					she-elephants who have tushes<br />
					and who have large footprints,<br />
					and he thinks<br />
					this might be a footprint of theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows them<br />
					and following them<br />
					he sees in the elephant forest<br />
					a great footprint,<br />
					long and broad,<br />
					and a grazing off of the high things<br />
					and the high things slashed by tusks.</p>

					<p class="f4">A skilled elephant tracker<br />
					does not at once come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed it is a great bull-elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, brahman,<br />
					in an elephant forest<br />
					she-elephants with stumpy tusks<br />
					who have large footprints,<br />
					and he thinks<br />
					this might be a footprint of theirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows them<br />
					and following them<br />
					he sees in the elephant forest<br />
					a great footprint,<br />
					long and broad,<br />
					and a grazing off of the high things<br />
					and the high things slashed by tusks<br />
					and the high things broken off at the boughs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sees that bull-elephant<br />
					at the root of a tree<br />
					or in the open,<br />
					walking<br />
					or standing<br />
					or sitting<br />
					or lying down.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is that bull-elephant himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, brahman,<br />
					a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br />
					a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened One,<br />
					endowed with right knowledge and conduct,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />

					with its recluses and brahmans,<br />
					its devas and men,<br />
					having realised them by his own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i> which is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the ending,<br />

					quite purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder<br />
					or a householder's son<br />
					or one born in another family<br />
					hears that <i>Dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard that <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					he gains faith in the <i>Tathāgata</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with this faith<br />

					to fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					wholly pure,<br />
					polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />

					<p class="f4">After a time,<br />

					be it small or great,<br />
					having cut off his hair and beard,<br />

					<p class="f4">He, being thus one who has gone forth<br />

					abandoning onslaught on creatures,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Abandoning unchastity,<br />
