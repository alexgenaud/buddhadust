<meta name="description" content="I.B. Horner's translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 63. Malunkyaputta, dissatisfied that the Buddha has not answered a number of questions concerning existence and non-existence confronts Gotama who explains to him that these questions are not expounded upon because they are not relevant to the goal of ending suffering. This sutta contains the famous simile of the man who refuses to accept medical treatment for an arrow wound until he knows all about the arrow, the shooter, etc." />

					the suppression of which<br />
					I lay down here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Māluṅkyāputta, understand<br />
					as not explained<br />
					what has not been explained by me,<br />
					and understand as explained<br />
					what has been explained by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Māluṅkyāputta, has not been explained by me?</p>

					<p class="f4">That the world is eternal has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the world is not eternal has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the world is an ending thing has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the world is not an ending thing has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the life-principle is the same as the body, has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the life-principle is one thing,<br />
					the body another has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the Tathāgata is after dying, has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the Tathāgata is not after dying has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the Tathāgata both is and is not after dying has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta;<br />
					that the Tathāgata neither is nor is not after dying has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, Māluṅkyāputta, has this not been explained by me?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because it is not connected with the goal,<br />
					is not fundamental to the Brahma-faring,<br />
					and does not conduce to turning away from,<br />
					nor to dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					calming,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					awakening nor to nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it has not been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what has been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta?</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is anguish'<br />
					has been explained by me, Māluṅkyāputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of anguish'<br />
					has been explained by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the stopping of anguish'<br />
					has been explained by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the course leading to the stopping of anguish'<br />
					has been explained by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, Māluṅkyāputta,<br />
					has this been explained by me?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because it is connected with the goal,<br />
					is fundamental to the Brahma-faring,<br />
					and conduces to turning away from,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					calming,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					awakening<br />
					and nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it has been explained by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Māluṅkyāputta,<br />
					understand as not explained<br />
					what has not been explained by me,<br />
					and understand as explained<br />
					what has been explained by me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Māluṅkyāputta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
