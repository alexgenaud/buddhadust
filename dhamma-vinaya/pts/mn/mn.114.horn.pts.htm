					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach youa disquisition on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					regarding what is to be followed<br />
					and what is not to be followed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br />
					pay careful attention<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that mental conduct is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in mental conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the arising of thought is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in the arising of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of perception is of two kinds,<br />

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of views is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in the assumption of views.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, monks, say that the assumption of individuality<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be <a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> followed<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, thus understand this to be the meaning in full<br />
					of what was spoken of by the Lord in brief,<br />
					but of which the meaning was not explained in full:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in bodily conduct.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This was said by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">In reference to what was it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed<br />
					and unskilled states of mind grow much,<br />
					skilled states of mind decrease,<br />
					this kind of bodily conduct is not to be followed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of bodily conduct is followed<br />
					and unskilled states of mind decrease,<br />

					this kind of bodily conduct is to be followed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what kind of bodily conduct, revered sir,<br />
					does a man follow<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />

					and even with those adorned with the garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what kind of bodily conduct, revered sir,<br />
					does a man follow<br />
					that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, revered sir,<br />
					someone, abandoning onslaught on creatures,<br />
					is restrained from onslaught on creatures;<br />
					the stick laid aside,<br />
					the sword laid aside,<br />
					he lives scrupulous,<br />
					merciful,<br />
					kindly and compassionate<br />
					to all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning taking what is not given,<br />
					he is restrained from taking what is not given;<br />
					he does not take by theft<br />
					any property of another<br />
					in village or jungle<br />
					that is not given to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning wrong-going in <a id="pg96"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span></a> regard to pleasures of the senses,<br />
					he is restrained from wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br />
					he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,<br />
					he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the father,<br />
					he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by the parents,<br />
					he  does not have intercourse with (girls) protected by a brother,<br />

					nor even with those adorned with the garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this kind of bodily conduct is followed, revered sir,<br />
					unskilled states of mind decrease,<br />
					skilled states of mind grow much.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, monks, say that bodily conduct is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in bodily conduct,'<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, monks, say that vocal conduct is of two kinds,<br />
					one of which is to be followed<br />
					and the other which is not to be followed;<br />
					and there is this disparity in vocal conduct.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This was said by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">In reference to what was it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed<br />
					and unskilled states of mind grow much,<br />
					skilled states of mind decrease,<br />
					this kind of vocal conduct is not to be followed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, if a certain kind of vocal conduct is followed<br />
					and unskilled states of mind decrease,<br />
					skilled states of mind grow much,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what land of vocal conduct, revered sir,<br />
					does a man follow<br />
					that unskilled states of mind grow much in him,<br />
					skilled states of mind decrease?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, revered sir,<br />
					someone is of lying speech;<br />
					when he is cited and questioned as a witness<br />
					before a council or a company<br />
					or amid his relations<br />
					or amid a guild<br />
					or a royal family,<br />
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, my good man,<br />
					say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he does not know, he says,<br />
					'I know,'<br />
					and although he knows, he says,<br />
					'I do not know ;<br />
					although he has not seen, he says,<br />
					'I saw,'<br />
					and although he has seen, he says,<br />
					'I did not see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech becomes intentional lying<br />
					either for his own sake<br />
					or for that of another<br />
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a slanderer;<br />
					having heard something at one place,<br />
					he makes it known elsewhere<br />
					for causing variance among those people;<br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he makes it known among these people<br />
					for causing variance among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he sows discord among those who were in harmony<br />
					or foments those who are at variance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Discord is his pleasure,<br />
					his delight,<br />
					his joy,<br />
					the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is one of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is rough,<br />
					hard,<br />
					severe on others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					bordering on wrath,<br />
					not conducive to concentration,<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a frivolous chatterer,<br />
					one who speaks at a wrong time,<br />
					not in accordance with fact,<br />
					one who speaks about what is not the goal,<br />
					about non-dhamma,<br />
					about non-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is not <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> worth treasuring;<br />
					owing to its being at the wrong time<br />
					it is incongruous,<br />
					has no purpose,<br />
					is not connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,<br />
					unskilled states of mind grow much,<br />
					skilled states of mind decrease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what kind of vocal conduct, revered sir,<br />
					does a man follow<br />
					that unskilled states of mind decrease in him,<br />
					skilled states of mind grow much?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, revered sir, someone,<br />
					abandoning lying speech<br />
					is restrained from lying speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is cited and questioned as a witness<br />
					before a council<br />
					or company<br />
					or amid his relations<br />
					or amid a guild<br />
					or a royal family,<br />
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, my good man,<br />
					say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">if he does not know he says,<br />
					'I do not know,'<br />
					and if he knows he says,<br />
					'I know ;<br />
					if he has not seen, he says,<br />
					'I did not see,'<br />
					and if he has seen, he says,<br />
					'I saw.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech is not intentional lying<br />
					either for his own sake<br />
					or for that of another<br />
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech,<br />
					he is restrained from slanderous speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard something at one place,<br />
					he is not one to repeat it elsewhere<br />
					for causing variance among those people;<br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he is not one to repeat it among these people<br />
					for causing variance among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way<br />
					he is a reconciler of those who are at variance<br />
					and one who combines those who are friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concord is his pleasure,<br />
					his delight,<br />
					his joy,<br />
					the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning harsh speech,<br />
					he is restrained from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is gentle,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasant to the manyfolk,<br />
					agreeable to the manyfolk -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning frivolous chatter,<br />
					he is restrained from frivolous chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one that speaks at a right time,<br />
					in accordance with fact,<br />
					about the goal,<br />
					about <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					about discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is worth treasuring,<br />
					with opportune similes,<br />
					purposeful,<br />
					connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this kind of vocal conduct is followed, revered sir,<br />
					unskilled states of mind decrease,<br />
					skilled states of mind grow much.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord said:</p>
