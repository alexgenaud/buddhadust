					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Aṇguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Āpaṇa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was the name of a market town in Aṇguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Āpaṇa for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked for alms-food<br />
					and was returning from the almsgathering after the meal,<br />
					he approached a forest-thicket<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had plunged into that forest-thicket,<br />
					he sat down at the root of a tree<br />
					for the day-sojoum.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Uāyin also,<br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					and taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Āpaṇa for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked for almsfood<br />
					and was returning from the almsgathering after the meal,<br />
					he approached that same forest-thicket<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had plunged into that forest-thicket,<br />
					he sat down at the root of a tree<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then while the venerable Uāyin was in private seclusion<br />
					a reasoning arose in his mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> "Indeed our Lord is a remover<br />
					of many painful things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a bringer<br />
					of many pleasant things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a remover<br />
					of many unskilled things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a bringer<br />
					of many skilled things."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Uāyin,<br />
					emerging from his seclusion towards evening,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Udayin spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"While I, revered sir, was in private seclusion,<br />
					a reasoning arose in my mind thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed our Lord is a remover<br />
					of many painful things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a bringer<br />
					of many pleasant things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a remover<br />
					of many unskilled things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a bringer<br />
					of many skilled things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">We, revered sir, used to eat in the evening<br />
					and in the morning<br />
					and during the day -<br />
					at a wrong time.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, the Lord at that time<br />
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Please do you, monks,<br />
					give up eating at this wrong time,<br />
					during the day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I was depressed because of this, revered sir,<br />
					I was sorry,<br />
					and thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord speaks of our giving up<br />
					that sumptuous food,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					which the believing householders give us<br />
					during the day -<br />
					at the wrong time,<br />
					and the Well-farer speaks of our rejecting it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of us, revered sir,<br />
					who look to the Lord with regard<br />
					and respect<br />
					and modesty<br />
					and fear of blame,<br />
					gave up such food as this<br />
					(given) during the day,<br />
					at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then we, revered sir,<br />
					used to eat in the evening<br />
					as well as in the morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was at this time<br />
					that the Lord addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Please do you, monks, give up<br />
					eating at this wrong time,<br />
					during the night.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I was depressed because of this, revered sir,<br />
					I was sorry,<br />
					and thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord speaks of our giving up<br />
					that which is reckoned as the more sumptuous<br />
					of these two meals,<br />
					and the Well-farer speaks of our rejecting it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, revered sir,<br />
					a certain man,<br />
					having obtained some curry during the day,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, let us put this aside,<br />
					and in the evening<br />
					we will enjoy it all together.'</p>

					<p class="f4">All cooking, revered sir, is at night,<br />
					there is little during the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those of us, revered sir,<br />
					who look to the Lord with regard<br />
					and respect<br />
					and modesty<br />
					and fear of blame,<br />
					gave up such food as this<br />
					(given) at night,<br />
					at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, revered sir,<br />
					when the monks were walking for almsfood<br />
					in the dense darkness of the night,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they would walk into a pool<br />
					at the entrance to a village,<br />
					and they would fall into the dirty pool<br />
					near <a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> the village,<br />
					and they would blunder into a thorny hedge,<br />
					and they would blunder into a sleeping cow,<br />
					and they would meet with young men,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					both those who had committed a crime<br />
					and those who had not,<br />
					and women would solicit them<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					against true dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time I, revered sir,<br />
					used to walk for almsfood<br />
					in the dense darkness of the night,<br />
					and a certain woman saw me during a lightning flash<br />
					as she was washing a bowl,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and terrified at seeing me,<br />
					she uttered a scream of horror:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How terrible for me,<br />
					indeed there is a demon after me.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This said,<br />
					I, revered sir, said to this woman:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sister, I am not a demon,<br />
					I am a monk standing for almsfood.'</p>

					<p class="f4">She said,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk's father must be dead,<br />
					the monk's mother must be dead<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					it were better for you, monk,<br />
					to have your belly cut out<br />
					with a sharp butcher's knife<br />
					than to walk for almsfood<br />
					for the sake of your belly<br />
					in the dense darkness of the night.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I remember this, revered sir,<br />
					it occurs to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed our Lord is a remover<br />
					of many painful things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a bringer<br />
					of many pleasant things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a remover<br />
					of many unskilled things,<br />
					indeed our Lord is a bringer<br />
					of many skilled things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But even so, Uāyin,<br />
					some foolish persons here,<br />
					on being told by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Give this up,'</p>

					<p class="f4">speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what of this trifling insignificant matter?</p>

					<p class="f4">This recluse lays too much emphasis on (exertion).'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But they do not give it up<br />
					and they cause dissatisfaction<br />
					to be nursed against me<br />
					and against those monks who desire the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">This<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> becomes for them,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> Uāyin,<br />
					a strong bond,<br />
					a stout bond,<br />
					a solid bond,<br />
					a bond that does not rot away,<br />
					a thick log of wood.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Uāyin, as a quail,<br />

					<a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> a weak bond,<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">This for them, Uāyin,<br />
