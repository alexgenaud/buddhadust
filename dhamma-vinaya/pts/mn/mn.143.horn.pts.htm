					in the Jeta Grove in <span class="mozp">Anāthapiṇḍika's</span> monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika was a sick man,<br />
					in pain,<br />
					grievously ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the householder Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					summoned a certain man and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, my good man,<br />
					approach the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head<br />
					and say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,<br />
					in pain,<br />
					grievously ill;<br />
					he salutes the Lord's feet with his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then approach the venerable Sāriputta;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					in my name salute the venerable Sāriputta's feet with your head<br />
					and say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,<br />
					in pain,<br />
					grievously ill;<br />
					he salutes the venerable Sāriputta's feet with his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, it would be good, revered sir,<br />
					if the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					out of compassion,<br />
					would approach the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">When that man had answered the householder Anāthapiṇḍika in assent,<br />
					saying,<br />
					"Very well, reverend sir,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					that man spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,<br />
					in pain,<br />
					grievously ill;<br />
					he salutes the Lord's feet with his head.'</p>

					having approached<br />
					and greeted the venerable <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					that man spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika is a sick man,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, it would be good, revered sir,<br />
					if the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					out of compassion,<br />
					would approach the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a id="pg310"><span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span></a> the venerable <span class="mozp">Sāriputta</span> clothed himself and,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached the dwelling of the householder Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					with the venerable Ānanda as his attendant;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down on the appointed seat<br />
					the venerable <span class="mozp">Sāriputta</span> spoke thus to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope that you, householder,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered Sāriputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">I am not better, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					I am not keeping going;<br />
					my grievously painful feelings are increasing,<br />
					not lessening;<br />
					an increase in them is apparent,<br />
					not a lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">As, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span> a strong man<br />
					might clamp a turban on one's head<br />
					with a tight leather strap,<br />
					even so, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />

					<p class="f4">As, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					a skilled cattle-butcher<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					might cut through the stomach<br />
					with a sharp butcher's knife,<br />
					even so, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					do very strong winds cut through my stomach.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not better, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />

					<p class="f4">As, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					two strong men,<br />
					having taken hold of a weaker man by his limbs,<br />
					might set fire to him,<br />
					might make him sizzle up over a charcoal pit,<br />
					even so, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					there is a fierce heat in my body.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not better, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					cried and shed tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus<br />
					to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, are you holding on<br />
					or are you sinking, householder?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered Ānanda,<br />
					am not holding on,<br />
					I am sinking.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Although the Teacher<br />
					and monks who were developing their minds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> visited <a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> me for a long time,<br />
					I have never yet heard reasoned talk such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reasoned talk such as this, householder,<br />
					does not (usually) occur<br />
					for householders clad in white.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is for those<br />
					that have gone forth, householder,<br />
					that reasoned talk such as this<br />
					(usually) occurs."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					let there occur reasoned talk such as this<br />
					for householders clad in white.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, revered <span class="mozp">Sāriputta,</span><br />
					young men of family<br />
					with but little dust in their eyes<br />
					who, not hearing <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					are declining,<br />
					but they could be learners of <i>dhamma</i>"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And when the venerable <span class="mozp">Sāriputta</span><br />
					and the venerable Ānanda<br />
					had exhorted the householder Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					with this exhortation,<br />
					they rose from their seats and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					and the venerable Ānanda, had departed,<br />
					the householder Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arose in the Tusita group (of devas).</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the night was far spent<br />
					the young deva<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					having illumined the whole of the Jeta Grove<br />

					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					the young deva Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					addressed the Lord in verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"This<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> friendly Jeta Grove frequented by the Order of seers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />

							So let whatever monk has gone beyond be excellent in these."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the young <i>deva</i> Anāthapiṇḍika.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord was approving.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the young <i>deva</i> Anāthapiṇḍika thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord approves of me,"<br />
					and having greeted the Lord,<br />
					then and there he vanished<br />
					keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord<br />
					towards the end of that night<br />
					addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when this night was far spent<br />
					a certain young <i>deva,</i><br />
					having illumined the whole of the Jeta Grove<br />
					with bis radiant beauty,<br />
					approached me;<br />
					having approached and greeted me,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					this young deva addressed me in verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"This friendly Jeta Grove frequented by the Order of seers,<br />
							Dwelt in by the King under <i>dhamma</i>, is the generator of my joy.<br />
							Deed, knowledge, and <i>dhamma</i>, the highest moral life -<br />
							By these are mortals purified, not by clan nor wealth.<br />
							Accordingly the wise man, beholding his own goal,<br />
							Seeking <i>dhamma</i> judiciously, is thus purified therein.<br />
							As <span class="mozp">Sāriputta</span> in wisdom, in morality and calm,<br />
							So let whatever monk has gone beyond be excellent in these."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke that young <i>deva</i>, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking,<br />
					'The Lord approves of me,'<br />
					and having greeted me,<br />
					then and there he vanished<br />
					keeping his right side towards me."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br />
					could that have been the young <i>deva</i> Anāthapiṇḍika?</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, the householder Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					had unwavering confidence in the venerable Sāriputta."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg315"><span class="f2 g"><b>[315]</b></span></a> "It is good,<br />
					it is good, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that could be obtained by reasoning, Ānanda,<br />
					has been obtained by you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, that young <i>deva</i><br />
					was Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					no other."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, the venerable Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Discourse on an Exhortation to Anāthapiṇḍika:<br />
					The First</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>  <i>bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> ii. 192-193.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> It seems necessary here to omit the <i>na</i> of Chalmers' text. For Anāthapiṇḍika was on the point of death and already failing or sinking. Otherwise one could translate, "I am not holding on (but) I am not sinking." Or as, "No, Ãnanda, I am holding on, I am not sinking." But this appears to be against the context and against grammatical usage, for the plain negative answer, our "No," is never expressed by the word <i>na</i>, not.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>manobhāvanīyo bhikkhū.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>manobhāvanīyo bhikkhu.</i> at <i>A.</i> iii. 317, <i>Vv.</i> 34. 13; and the same expression, in the genitive plural, at <i>A.</i> v. 55, <i>S.</i> iii. 1, which <i>SA.</i> iii. 249-250 explains by <i>mana-vaḍḍhanaka.</i> It is possible that <i>bhikkhū</i> in the above <i>M.</i> passage should read <i>bhikkhu,</i> the reference then being to Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This should not be taken to point to any esoteric element in the giving of the Teaching. Many passages could be adduced to show it was open to aü who wanted to hear it; see especially <i>D.</i> ii. 100 and <i>S.</i> iv. 314-316. But as <i>MA.</i> v. 80 says, talk on giving was (usually) addressed to householders. This is what they wanted to hear, so why should they receive a talk that did not please them? <i>Paṭibhāti</i> is a semi-technical term; it might be translated here as "vouchsafe": a talk such as this is not (usually) vouchsafed (by monks) for householders: because it is not appropriate, since their mental development is not as a rule sufficiently advanced for them to appreciate it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> i. 168, <i>Vin.</i> i. 5, where these words form part of Brahmā Sahampati's plea to the Buddha to teach <i>dhamma</i>. Brahmā however says that there are beings, <i>satta,</i> with but little dust in their eyes, instead of "young men of family," <i>kulaputtā;</i> but it was of these that Anāthapiṇḍika was thinking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> I think <i>devaputta</i> may sometimes be a young or new <i>deva,</i> one who has just become a <i>deva.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 80 says he wanted to speak praise of "my Jeta Grove," the Order of monks, the Tathāgata, the ariyan Way, and Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> As at <i>S.</i> i. 33. See notes at <i>K.S.</i> i. 46.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v, 81 paraphrases "seers," <i>isi,</i> by monks, bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> "Here <i>kamma</i> is volition (striving) for the Way," <i>maggacetanā,</i> <i>MA.</i> v. 81. On <i>cetanā</i> as <i>kamma</i> see <i>M.</i> i. 301, <i>A.</i> iii. 415.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>vijjā</i> is extra-sensory knowledge of the Way, <i>maggapaññā,</i> or it is right understanding and purpose (or thought), <i>MA.</i> v. 81.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The <i>dhamma</i> belonging to concentration, <i>samādhi-pakkhikadhamma.</i> It therefore seems as if <i>dhamma</i> here, as sometimes elsewhere, is being used instead of <i>citta</i> or <i>samādhi</i> to represent the middle one of the three branches of the training: <i>sīla, samādhi</i> (or, <i>citta</i>), <i>paññā.</i> Or it means, as recognised at <i>MA.</i> v. 81, (right) endeavour, mindfulness and concentration.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> "The life of one established in moral conduct is the highest," Or, <i>sīla</i> is (right) speech, action and mode of livelihood, <i>MA.</i> v. 81.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> "Selves are purified by this eightfold Way," according to <i>MA.</i> v. 81 which, in its exegesis on <i>vijjā,</i> <i>dhamma</i> and <i>sīla,</i> has presented the factors of the Way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Either the <i>dhamma</i> belonging to concentration, or the <i>dhamma</i> of the five <i>khandha</i> on which the teaching of the four truths of anguish centres.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> In this ariyan Way, or in these four truths, <i>MA.</i> v. 81.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> "is the best," <i>MA.</i> v, 81.</p>
