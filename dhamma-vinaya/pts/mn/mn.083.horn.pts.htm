					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Mithilā<br />
					in Makhādeva's Mango Grove.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord smiled (when he <a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> came to a) certain place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that the Lord is smiling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not without motive<br />
					do Tathāgatas smile."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					having arranged his robe over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir, what is the cause,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that the Lord is smiling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not without motive<br />
					do Tathāgatas smile."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, Ānanda,<br />
					in this very Mithilā<br />
					there was a king named Makhādeva,<br />
					a <i>dhamma</i>-man,<br />
					a king under <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					firm in <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					a great king who fared by <i>dhamma</i><br />
					among brahmans and householders,<br />
					townsfolk and countryfolk,<br />
					and who observed the Observance<br />
					on the fourteenth,<br />
					fifteenth<br />
					and eighth days<br />
					of the half-month.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br />
					many hundreds of years,<br />
					many thousands of years,<br />
					King Makhādeva addressed his barber,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, good barber,<br />
					you see grey hairs growing on my head,<br />
					then you may tell me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the barber answered King Makhādeva in assent,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br />
					many hundreds of years,<br />
					many thousands of years,<br />
					the barber saw grey hairs growing<br />
					on King Makhādeva's head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that, Ānanda,<br />
					he spoke thus to King Makhādeva:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Death's messengers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> have appeared to his majesty;<br />
					grey hairs are to be seen growing on his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, good barber,<br />
					when you have pulled out those grey hairs properly with the tweezers,<br />
					place them on my fingers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, your majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, Ānanda, the barber had answered King Makhādeva in assent,<br />
					he pulled out the grey hairs properly with the tweezers<br />
					and placed them on King Makhādeva's fingers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, King Makhādeva,<br />

					undergo the ripening of lovely deeds?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Conduct me by both, Mātali.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Ānanda, the charioteer Mātali<br />
					brought King Nimi<br />
					to the Sudhammā debating hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br />
					saw King Nimi approaching from the distance;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he spoke to King Nimi:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, sire,<br />
					you are welcome, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sire, the Devas of the Thirty-Three are sitting down<br />
					in the Sudhammā debating hall<br />
					praising you,<br />
					and saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed it is a gain for the Videhas<br />
					indeed it is well gotten by the Videhas<br />
					in that their king Nimi is a <i>dhamma</i>-man,<br />
					a king under <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					firm in <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					a great king who fares by <i>dhamma</i><br />
					among brahmans and householders,<br />
					townsfolk and countryfolk,<br />
					and who observes the Observance<br />
					on the fourteenth,<br />
					fifteenth<br />
					and eighth days of the half-month."</p>

					<p class="f4">Sire, the Devas of the Thirty-Three<br />
					are anxious to see you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejoice, sire,<br />
					among the Devas<br />
					with a deva's majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, good sir;<br />
					let me return to Mithilā itself<br />
					where I will fare by <i>dhamma</i><br />
					among brahmans and householders,<br />
					townsfolk and countryfolk<br />
					and will observe the Observance<br />
					on the fourteenth,<br />
					fifteenth<br />
					and eighth days of the half-month.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Sakka, the lord of devas,<br />
					summoned the charioteer Mātali and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, good Mātali, having harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds,<br />
					take King Nimi back to Mithila itself.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg272"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span></a> 'So be it, your honour.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, Mātali the charioteer,<br />
					having answered Sakka, the lord of devas, in assent,<br />
					harnessed a chariot with a thousand thoroughbreds<br />
					and took King Nimi back to Mithilā itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there, Ānanda,<br />
					King Nimi fared by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					among brahmans and householders,<br />
					townsfolk and countryfolk,<br />
					and he observed the Observance<br />
					on the fourteenth,<br />
					fifteenth<br />
					and eighth days<br />
					of the half-month.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br />
					many hundreds of years,<br />
					many thousands of years,<br />
					King Nimi addressed his barber,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, good barber,<br />
					you see grey hairs growing on my head,<br />
					then you may tell me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the barber answered King Nimi in assent,<br />
					saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, at the end of many years,<br />
					many hundreds of years,<br />
					many thousands of years,<br />
					the barber saw grey hairs growing<br />
					on King Nimi's head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that, Ānanda,<br />
					he spoke thus to King King Nimi:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Death's messengers have appeared to his majesty;<br />
					grey hairs are to be seen growing on his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, good barber,<br />
					when you have pulled out those grey hairs properly with the tweezers,<br />
					place them on my fingers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, your majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, Ānanda, the barber had answered King Nimi in assent,<br />
					he pulled out the grey hairs properly with the tweezers<br />
					and placed them on King Nimi's fingers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, King Nimi,<br />
					having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br />
					had the prince who was his eldest son summoned<br />
					and spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Dear Prince,<br />
					Death's messengers have appeared to me;<br />
					grey hairs are to be seen growing on my head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Human sense-pleasures have been enjoyed by me;<br />
					it is now time to seek deva-like sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come you, dear Prince,<br />
					rule this kingdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For I, having cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					will go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, dear Prince,<br />
					when you too see grey hairs growing on your head,<br />
					then, having given the boon of a village to the barber,<br />
					having handed over the kingdom properly<br />
					to the prince who is your eldest son,<br />
					having cut off your hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					you should go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This lovely custom<br />
					founded by me<br />
					you should maintain;<br />
					do not you be the last man after me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dear Prince, while two persons exist<br />
					and there is a breaking of such a lovely custom,<br />
					whichever of these (breaks it)<br />
					he is the last man.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, dear Prince, speak thus to you:</p>

					<p class="f4">This lovely custom<br />
					founded by me<br />
					you should maintain;<br />
					do not you be the last man after me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, King Nimi,<br />
					having given the boon of the village to the barber,<br />
					having handed over the kingdom properly<br />
					to the prince who was his eldest son,<br />
					having in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove<br />
					cut off his hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					went forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness,<br />
					likewise the second,<br />
					likewise the third,<br />
					likewise the fourth;<br />
					just so above,<br />
					below,<br />
					across;<br />
					he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					in every way,<br />
					with a mind of friendliness<br />
					that was far-reaching,<br />
					wide-spread,<br />
					immeasurable,<br />
					without enmity,<br />
					without malevolence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of compassion,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwelt, having suffused the first quarter with a mind of sympathetic joy,<br />
					likewise the second,<br />
					likewise the third,<br />
					likewise the fourth;<br />
					just so above,<br />
					below,<br />
					across;<br />
					he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Nimi<br />
					had played at boys' sports<br />
					for 84,000 years,<br />
					had ruled as a viceroy<br />
					for 84,000 years,<br />
					and had ruled as a king<br />
					for 84,000 years;<br />
					for 84,000 years,<br />
					gone forth from home into homelessness<br />
					in this very Makhādeva Mango Grove,<br />
					he fared the Brahma-faring.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having developed the four Brahma-abidings,<br />
					was one who at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					reached the Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Ānanda, King Nimi's son was called Kaḷārajanaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">He did not go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He broke that lovely custom;<br />
					of those (who observed it)<br />
					he was the last man.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that this occurs to you, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'At that time King Makhādeva<br />
					by whom that lovely custom was founded<br />
					was someone else.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But this, Ānanda, must not be understood thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, at that time, was King Makhādeva,<br />
					I founded that lovely custom;<br />
					the folk that came after<br />
					maintained that lovely custom founded by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that lovely custom, Ānanda,<br />
					did not conduce to turning away from,<br />
					nor to dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					tranquillity,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening<br />
					or nibbāna -<br />
					only to reaching the Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this lovely custom founded by me now, Ānanda,<br />
					conduces to absolute turning away from,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					tranquillity,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening<br />
					and nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Ānanda,<br />
					is the lovely custom founded by me now<br />
					that conduces to absolute turning away from,<br />
					to dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					tranquillity,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening<br />
					and nibbāna.?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this ariyan eightfold Way itself,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					perfect view,<br />
					perfect thought,<br />
					perfect speech,<br />
					perfect action,<br />
					perfect mode of livelihood,<br />
					perfect endeavour,<br />
					perfect mindfulness,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is this lovely custom founded by me now, Ānanda, that conduces to absolute turning away from away from,<br />

					stopping,<br />
					tranquillity,<br />
					super-knowledge,<br />
					self-awakening<br />
					and nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, Ānanda, speak about it thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This lovely custom founded by me<br />

					do not you be the last man after me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, while two persons exist<br />

					<p class="f4">In regard to this, I, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
