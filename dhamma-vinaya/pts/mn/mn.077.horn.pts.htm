					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove<br />
					at the squirrels' feeding place.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a number of very celebrated wanderers, such as Anugāra,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Varadhara<br />
					and the wanderer Sakuludāyin,<br />
					and other celebrated wanderers,<br />
					were staying in the wanderers' park<br />
					at the peacocks' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Rājagaha for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is too early to walk for almsfood in Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to approach the wanderers' park,<br />
					the peacocks' feeding place<br />
					and the wanderer Sakuludāyin?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord approached the peacocks' feeding place<br />
					in the wanderers' park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br />
					was sitting down with the great company of wanderers<br />
					shouting out with a loud noise,<br />
					a great noise,<br />
					talking various kinds of inferior talk<br />
					that is to say:<br />
					talk on kings,<br />
					thieves,<br />
					great ministers,<br />
					armies,<br />
					fears,<br />
					battles,<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					scents,<br />
					relations,<br />
					vehicles,<br />
					villages,<br />
					market towns,<br />
					towns,<br />
					the country,<br />
					women,<br />
					heroes,<br />
					streets,<br />
					wells,<br />
					those departed before,<br />
					talk of diversity,<br />
					speculation about the world,<br />
					speculation about the sea,<br />
					talk about becoming or not becoming<br />
					thus or thus.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he called his own company to order, saying:

					"Good sirs, let there be little noise;<br />
					do not, good sirs, make a noise;<br />
					this is the recluse Gotama who is coming.</p>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama wishes for little noise,<br />
					is trained to little noise,<br />
					praises little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he may consider approaching<br />
					if he knows that this is a company of little noise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord approached the wanderer Sakuludāyin.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sakuludāyin spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the revered Gotama come,<br />
					there is a welcome for the revered Gotama;<br />
					it is long since the revered Gotama made this opportunity!||<br />
					that is to say for coming here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the revered Gotama sit down,<br />
					this seat is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord sat down on the seat that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the wanderer Sakuludāyin,<br />
					having taken a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the wanderer Sakuludāyin<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the talk<br />
					for which you are now gathered together here, Udāyin?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg204"><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></a> And what was your talk that was interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let be that talk, revered sir, for which we are now gathered together here.</p>

					<p class="f4">It will not be difficult for the Lord to hear this talk later.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some time ago,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />

					respected,<br />
					esteemed,<br />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Nātaputta the Jain was teaching <i>dhamma</i><br />

					<p class="f4">But a certain disciple of his let it be heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time Nātaputta the Jain,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Let the good sirs be quiet;<br />

					good sirs,<br />

					<p class="f4">These are not asking the good sirs,<br />
					they are asking us,<br />
					we will explain to them."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then many of Nātaputta the Jain's disciples,<br />
					having refuted him,<br />
					on seceding, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You do not understand this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline,<br />
					I understand this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can you understand this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline?</p>

					<p class="f4">You are faring along wrongly,<br />

					<p class="f4">There is sense in what I say,<br />
					no sense in what you say.</p>

					<p class="f4">You said at the end<br />

					<p class="f4">Your method is reversed,<br />
					you are refuted,<br />
					you are caught out,<br />
