					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Ānanda gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited<br />
					and delighted the monks<br />
					with talk on <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					in an assembly hall;<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached that assembly hall;<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down,<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks,<br />

					and delighted the monks<br />

							There is no bargaining with the great hosts of Death.<br />
