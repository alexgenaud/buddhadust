					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kusinara">Kusinārā</a><br />
					in the Wood of the Offerings.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What then is there for you, monks, in me?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of robe-material<br />
					or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of almsfood<br />
					or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of lodgings<br />
					or that the <a id="pg25"><span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span></a> recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of success or decline<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> in this or that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Lord; we do not think:<br />
					'The recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of almsfood<br />
					or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of lodgings<br />
					or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of success or decline in this or that.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, monks, there is not this for you in me:<br />
					that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of almsfood<br />
					or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of lodgings<br />
					or that the recluse Gotama teaches dhamma<br />
					for the sake of success or decline in this or that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what then is there, monks, for you in me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is thus, Lord, in the Lord for us:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord, compassionate,<br />
					seeking welfare,<br />
					tenches dhamma out of compassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, monks, it is thus for you in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord, compassionate,<br />
					seeking welfare,<br />
					teaches dhamma out of compassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, those things taught to you by me<br />
					out of superknowledge,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is to say<br />
					the four applications of mindfulness,<br />
					the four right efforts,<br />
					the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					the five controlling faculties,<br />
					the five powers,<br />
					the seven links in awakening,<br />
					the ariyan eightfold Way -<br />
					all together,<br />
					in harmony<br />

					you should train yourselves in each and all of these.</p>
