					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Cātumā in the Myrobalan Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time at least five hundred <a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> monks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with Sāriputta and Moggallāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at their head<br />
					had arrived at Cātumā to see the Lord,<br />

					a great noise<br />
					as these incoming monks<br />
					were exchanging greetings<br />
					with the resident monks,<br />
					while lodgings were being prepared<br />
					and bowls and robes<br />
					were being put away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, Ānanda, is this loud noise,<br />
					this great noise,<br />
					which seems like that of fisherfolk<br />
					when hauling in a catch?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, these monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do not you, monks, think<br />

					when hauling in a catch?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, at least five hundred monks<br />

					have arrived at Cātumā to see the Lord,<br />
					and while the incoming monks<br />
					are exchanging greetings<br />

					<p class="f4">"Go away, monks,<br />
					I dismiss you,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Very well, revered sir,"<br />
					and these monks<br />
					having answered the Lord in assent,<br />
					having greeted the Lord<br />
					keeping their right sides towards him,<br />

					departed<br />
					taking their bowls and robes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> Now at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā<br />

					<p class="f4">The Sakyans of Cātumā saw these monks coming in the distance;<br />
					having seen them,<br />
					they approached these monks;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they spoke thus to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, where are you, venerable ones, going?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the Order of monks<br />
					has been dismissed by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, venerable ones,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friends,"<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Cātumā approached the Lord;<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">There are here,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">And even, revered sir,<br />
					as there may be faltering,<br />

					<p class="f4">Not seeing the Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />
					even as the Order of monks<br />
					was helped previously by the Lord,<br />
					so let the Lord help the Order of monks now."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					knowing by mind<br />
					the reasoning in the Lord's mind,<br />
					as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm<br />

					even so, vanishing from the Brahma-world<br />
					he appeared before the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					arranging his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					saluting the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir,<br />
					let the Lord rejoice the Order of monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">The Sakyans of Cātumā<br />
					and Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					were able to reconcile the Lord<br />
					by the analogy of the seeds<br />
					and the analogy of the young<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> (calf).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Arise, your reverences,<br />
					pick up your bowls and robes,<br />
					the Lord has been reconciled<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					and these monks,<br />
					having answered the venerable Moggallāna the Great in assent,<br />
					rising from their seats,<br />
					taking their bowls and robes,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What did you, Sāriputta, think<br />
					when the Older of monks was dismissed by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When the Order of monks was dismissed by the Lord,<br />
					I, revered sir, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is now unconcerned,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do you wait, Sāriputta,<br />
					do you wait, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, never let such a thought arise in you again."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Moggallāna the Great, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What did you, Moggallāna, think<br />
					when the Order of monks was dismissed by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When the Order of monks was dismissed by the Lord,<br />
					I, revered sir, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is now unconcerned,<br />
					he will abide intent on <a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> abiding in ease here and now,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, Moggallāna,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the Order of monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four perils<br />
					for one going down to the water<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Peril of waves,<br />

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, some young man of family,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This passage also occurs at <i>Ud.</i> 24-25, where Yasoja is at the head of 500 monks, but the episode is there placed at Sāvatthī, These monks were perhaps only recently ordained, and that is why the two chief disciples were in charge of them. <i>MA.</i> iii. 172 speaks of them as <i>kulaputtā,</i> as though hardly recognising their passage to monk's status. But with this compare the first speech ascribed to the Lord in the next Discourse where he refers to those who have gone forth both as young men of family and as monks.</p>
