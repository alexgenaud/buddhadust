					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Cātumā in the Myrobalan Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time at least five hundred <a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> monks,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with Sāriputta and Moggallāna<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at their head<br />
					had arrived at Cātumā to see the Lord,<br />
					and there was a loud noise,<br />
					a great noise<br />
					as these incoming monks<br />
					were exchanging greetings<br />
					with the resident monks,<br />
					while lodgings were being prepared<br />
					and bowls and robes<br />
					were being put away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, Ānanda, is this loud noise,<br />
					this great noise,<br />
					which seems like that of fisherfolk<br />
					when hauling in a catch?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, these monks,<br />
					at least five hundred,<br />

					are exchanging greetings<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />

					<p class="f4">"The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					and these monks,<br />
					having answered the venerable Ānanda in assent,<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do not you, monks, think<br />
					that the loud noise,<br />
					the great noise<br />
					is like that of fisherfolk<br />
					when hauling in a catch?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, at least five hundred monks<br />
					with Sāriputta and Moggallāna at their head<br />
					have arrived at Cātumā to see the Lord,<br />
					and while the incoming monks<br />
					are exchanging greetings<br />
					with the resident monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Go away, monks,<br />
					I dismiss you,<br />
					you should not stay near me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, revered sir,"<br />
					and these monks<br />
					having answered the Lord in assent,<br />
					having greeted the Lord<br />

					departed<br />
					taking their bowls and robes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> Now at that time the Sakyans of Cātumā<br />
					were assembled in the conference hall<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Sakyans of Cātumā saw these monks coming in the distance;<br />
					having seen them,<br />
					they approached these monks;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they spoke thus to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, where are you, venerable ones, going?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the Order of monks<br />
					has been dismissed by the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, venerable ones,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friends,"<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Cātumā approached the Lord;<br />

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">There are here,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Not getting a chance to see the Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">And even, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Not seeing the Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />
					even as the Order of monks<br />
					was helped previously by the Lord,<br />
					so let the Lord help the Order of monks now."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					knowing by mind<br />
					the reasoning in the Lord's mind,<br />
					as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm<br />

					even so, vanishing from the Brahma-world<br />
					he appeared before the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					arranging his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />
					saluting the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir,<br />
					let the Lord rejoice the Order of monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">The Sakyans of Cātumā<br />
					and Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					were able to reconcile the Lord<br />
					by the analogy of the seeds<br />
					and the analogy of the young<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> (calf).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Arise, your reverences,<br />
					pick up your bowls and robes,<br />
					the Lord has been reconciled<br />
					by the Sakyans of Cātumā<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					and these monks,<br />
					having answered the venerable Moggallāna the Great in assent,<br />
					rising from their seats,<br />
					taking their bowls and robes,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What did you, Sāriputta, think<br />
					when the Older of monks was dismissed by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When the Order of monks was dismissed by the Lord,<br />
					I, revered sir, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is now unconcerned,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do you wait, Sāriputta,<br />
					do you wait, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, never let such a thought arise in you again."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Moggallāna the Great, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What did you, Moggallāna, think<br />
					when the Order of monks was dismissed by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When the Order of monks was dismissed by the Lord,<br />
					I, revered sir, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is now unconcerned,<br />
					he will abide intent on <a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> abiding in ease here and now,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, Moggallāna,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the Order of monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four perils<br />
					for one going down to the water<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Peril of waves,<br />

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, some young man of family,<br />

But with this compare the first speech ascribed to the Lord in the next Discourse where he refers to those who have gone forth both as young men of family and as monks.</p>
