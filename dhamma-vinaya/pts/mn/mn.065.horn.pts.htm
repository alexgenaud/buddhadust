					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, monks, partake of my food at one session.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Partaking of my food at one session,<br />
					I, monks, am aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy<br />
					and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, do you too, monks,<br />
					partake of your food at one session.</p>

					<p class="f4">Partaking of your food at one session,<br />
					you too, monks, will be aware of good health,<br />
					of being without illness,<br />
					of bouyancy<br />
					and strength<br />
					and living in comfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am not capable<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of eating my food at one session;<br />
					revered sir, if I ate my food at one session,<br />
					I might have scruples,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I might have misgivings."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, you, Bhaddāli,<br />
					having eaten one portion there where you were invited,<br />
					having taken another portion away,<br />
					might eat that too;<br />
					so could you, Bhaddāli, eating thus, keep yourself going."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am not capable of eating in this fashion;<br />
					even eating so, revered sir,<br />
					I might have scruples,<br />
					I might have misgivings."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhaddāli,<br />
					while a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					while the Order of monks was undertaking the training,<br />
					made known his inability.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhaddāli<br />
					did not see the Lord face to face<br />
					for an entire three months<br />
					because he was one who did not carry out in full<br />
					the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a number of monks<br />
					were making up robe-material for the Lord,<br />
					and they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When the Lord's robe-material is settled,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he will set out on a three months tour."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhaddāli approached these monks;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with these monks;<br />
					having conversed in a <a id="pg109"><span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span></a> friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">These monks spoke thus to the venerable Bhaddāli<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Bhaddāli,<br />
					this robe-material is being made up for the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the robe-material is settled,<br />
					the Lord will set out on a three months tour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Please, reverend Bhaddāli,<br />
					pay careful attention to this opportunity,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					lest later it is more difficult for you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverences,"<br />
					and the venerable Bhaddāli, having answered these monks in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me,<br />
					foolish,<br />
					misguided<br />
					and wrong that I was,<br />
					inasmuch as I made known an inability<br />

					and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression<br />
					as a transgression<br />
					for the sake of restraint in the future,"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Bhaddāli, a transgression overcame you,<br />

					<p class="f4">At that time<br />
					this was not realized by you, Bhaddāli:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord is staying near <i>Sāvatthī</i><br />

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Bhaddāli,<br />

					inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me<br />

					you made known your inability.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since you, Bhaddāli,<br />
					see the transgression<br />
					as a transgression<br />
					and confess it according to the rule,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					we acknowledge it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Bhaddāli, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br />
					this is growth:<br />
					whoever, seeing a transgression<br />
					as a transgression,<br />
					confesses according to the rule,<br />
					he comes to restraint in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Bhaddāli,<br />
					some monk is not one that carries out<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> in full the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose I were to resort to a remote lodging -<br />
					to a forest,<br />
					to the root of a tree,<br />
					a mountain slope,<br />
					a wild place,<br />
					a hill cave,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />
					a woodland thicket,<br />
					the open air,<br />
					a heap of straw -<br />
					I should probably realize conditions of further-men,<br />
					the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he resorts to a remote lodging -<br />
					to a forest,<br />
					to the root of a tree,<br />
					a mountain slope,<br />
					a wild place,<br />
					a hill cave,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />
					a woodland thicket,<br />
					the open air,<br />
					a heap of straw.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is staying aloof in this way<br />
					the Teacher upbraids him,<br />
					and when they have examined him<br />
					his learned fellow Brahma-farers upbraid him,<br />
					and <i>devatās</i> upbraid him,<br />
					and the self upbraids the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, upbraided by the Teacher,<br />
					and upbraided by his learned fellow Brahina-farers<br />
					after they have examined him,<br />
					and upbraided by <i>devatās,</i><br />
					and the self upbraided by the self,<br />
					does not realize conditions of further-men,<br />
					the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is <a id="pg112"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></a> the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Bhaddāli,<br />
					since he is not one that carries out in full<br />
					the training under the Teacher's instruction.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But, Bhaddāli, there is some monk here<br />
					who fully carries out the training<br />
					under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If I were to resort to a remote lodging -<br />
					to a forest,<br />
					to the root of a tree,<br />

					a wild place,<br />
					a hill cave,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />
					a woodland thicket,<br />
					the open air,<br />
					a heap of straw.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is staying aloof in this way<br />
					neither the Teacher upbraids him,<br />
					nor, after they have examined him,<br />
					do his learned fellow Brahma-farers upbraid him,<br />
					nor do <i>devotās</i> upbraid him,<br />
					nor does the self upbraid the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, neither upbraided by the Teacher,<br />
					nor upbraided by his learned fellow Brahma-farers<br />
					after they have examined him,<br />
					nor upbraided by <i>devatās,</i><br />
					nor the self upbraided by the self,<br />
					realizes conditions of further-men,<br />
					the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters and abides in the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Bhaddāli,<br />
					for one who fully carries out the training<br />
					under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a monk,<br />
					by allaying initial and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Bhaddāli,<br />
					for one who fully carries out the training<br />
					under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and he enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Bhaddāli,<br />
					for one who fully carries out the training<br />
					under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, a monk<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish <a id="pg113"><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span></a> nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Bhaddāli,<br />
					for one who fully carries out the training<br />
					under the Teacher's instruction.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the mind thus composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					stable,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind<br />
					to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />

					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such a one was I by name,<br />

So conditions causing cankers arise in regard to the lodgings. The rules of training laid down for an Order attained to largeness are (1) "whatever monk should lie down to sleep with one who is not ordained, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence" (<i>Pāc.</i> 5. <i>Vin.</i> iv. 16), and (2) "Whatever nun should ordain every year, there is a <i>pācittiya</i>. ... (3) Whatever nun should ordain two (probationers) in one year, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence "(Nuns' <i>Pāc.</i> 72,73, <i>Vin.</i> iv. 336, 337).</p>

The conditions causing cankers to arise when the Order has arrived at the height of gains or acquisitions are controlled by <i>Pāc.</i> 41 (<i>Vin.</i> iv. 92, cited at <i>MA.</i> iii. 156): "Whatever monk should with his own hand give solid or soft food to an unclothed ascetic or to a male or female wanderer, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>yasagga.</i> Not at <i>Vin.</i> iii. 10. For this stage in the Order's deterioration the 51st <i>Pāc.</i> (<i>Vin.</i> iv. 110) was laid down: "in drinking strong drinks and intoxicants, there is a <i>pācittiya</i> offence," cited at <i>MA.</i> iii. 156. <i>Cf.</i> <i>lābhagga-yasaggappattā</i> of the Bodhisatta's mother at <i>Jā.</i> i. 51.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> At this stage there are misunderstandings, and people explain the Teacher's instruction by what is against <i>Dhamma</i> and against <i>vinaya</i>. <i>MA.</i> iii. 156 cites <i>Vin.</i> iv. 135-139, which include the "perverse or wrong views" ascribed to the monk Ariṭṭha and the novice Kandaka (<i>Pāc.</i> 68, 70).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>rattaññuta.</i> Here, as in the other cases, the reference is to the members of the Order rather than to the Order as a whole. So, here the meaning is "when those who have gone forth for a long time know how many nights it is since they first went forth." <i>MA.</i> iii. 157 refers to Upasena Vaṇganta-putta's offence in ordaining his pupil when he himself was only of one year's standing - he had seen monks being ordained when they were less than ten years' standing. So, "One of less than ten years' standing should not be ordained "(<i>Vin.</i> i. 59), and "One should not be ordained by an ignorant, inexperienced (monk) ... I allow monks to be ordained by an experienced, capable (monk) if they are of ten years' standing or of more than ten years' standing"(<i>Vin.</i> i. 60). As <i>MA.</i> iii. 157 remarks two rules of training are laid down to cover the time of reaching "long-standing."</p>
