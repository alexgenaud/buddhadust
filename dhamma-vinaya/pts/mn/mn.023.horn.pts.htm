					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This is Kumāra-Kassapa, so called even when he was grown up, MA. ii. 120. He lived in Blind Men's Grove fulfilling the course for learners, MA. ii. 124. He took this sutta as the subject of his meditations and so developed insight and won arahantship, MA. ii. 134. He was therefore not an arahant at the time when it was delivered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This is the meaning attributed to abhikkantāya by MA. ii. 124 — the meaning of "waning" as against its other meaning of "lovely," "beautiful" and "wonderful" (in the sense of assenting).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> MA. ii. 124: "devatā" is the common (general or joint) appellation of devas, and daughters of devas. Here it means a deva." Cf. SA. ii. 14, which says here it means <i>devaputta</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> abhikkantavaṇṇā. MA. ii. 125 says abhikkanta is here in its sense of "beautiful," abhirūpa; and among seven meanings attributed to vaṇṇa, the first, that of "skin," chavi, is meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The deva and Kassapa had been two of five friends in the time of the Buddha Kassapa. Therefore the deva did not greet him, MA. ii. 126.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> caŋgavāra, explained at MA. ii. 128 as khāraparissāvanna, strainer for potash? Cf. cangavāraka at Miln. 365, translated as "dyers' straining cloth"; and Jā. v. 186, translated as "sieve." Jā. Comy. says "as water placed in a dyers' khāracaŋgavāra quickly runs out." Neumann's translation. Majjh., I 239, gives Geflecht, basket-work. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/chlm/mn/mn.023.chlm.sbb.htm">Chalmers</a> has "strainer."</p>
