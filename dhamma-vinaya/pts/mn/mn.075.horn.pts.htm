					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Kurus -<br />
					the market town of the Kurus was called Kammāssadhamma -<br />
					on a spreading of grass in the fire-room<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of a brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed early in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Kammāssadhamma for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having walked in Kammāssadhamma for almsfood,<br />
					returning from his alms-gathering after the meal,<br />
					having plunged into a forest thicket,<br />
					he sat down at the root of a tree<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt502" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg502"><span class="f2">[502]</span></a>Then the wanderer <span class="mozp">Māgandiya</span>,<br />
					who was constantly pacing up and down and roaming about on foot,<br />
					approached the fire-room of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Māgandiya saw the spreading of grass made ready in the fire-room of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan;<br />
					seeing it, he spoke thus to the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For whom is this spreading of grass laid down in the good Bhāradvāja's fire-room?</p>

					<p class="f4">It seems like a recluse's steeping place."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Māgandiya, there is the recluse Gotama,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					and about this revered Gotama a lovely reputation has gone abroad thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He is indeed the Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with right knowledge and conduct,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					incomparable trainer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and men,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">That sleeping place is ready for this good Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, good Bhāradvāja,<br />
					we are seeing a poor sight<br />
					in seeing the sleeping place of the good Gotama,<br />
					the destroyer of growth."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> "Mind what you say,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Māgandiya,<br />
					mind what you say, Māgandiya.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many learned nobles and learned brahmans and learned householders and learned recluses have great faith in this good Gotama,<br />
					and are trained in the ariyan right path,<br />
					in dhamma,<br />
					in what is skilled."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"If we could only see that revered Gotama face to face, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					face to face would we say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is handed down thus in a discourse of ours."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it is not disagreeable to the good Māgandiya,<br />
					I will tell this to the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is of no consequence if the good Bhāradvāja should tell him just what has been said."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, with purified deva-hearing surpassing that of men,<br />
					heard this conversation between the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgandiya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the fire-room of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan;<br />
					having approached, he sat down on the spreading of grass that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There was some conversation, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					between you and the wanderer Māgandiya <a id="pt503" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg503"><span class="f2">[503]</span></a> concerning this same grass spreading."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said the brahman Bhāradvāja,<br />
					greatly moved and startled,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But this was the very thing I wanted to tell the good Gotama,<br />
					but the revered Gotama anticipated me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this conversation between the Lord and the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan was interrupted when the wanderer Māgandiya,<br />
					who was constantly pacing up and down and roaming about on foot,<br />
					approached the Lord in the fire-room of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan;<br />
					having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the wanderer Māgandiya was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to him:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Māgandiya, the eye delights in material shapes,<br />
					is delighted by material shapes,<br />

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Māgandiya?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man envy that other leper man<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, good Gotama,<br />

					but if there is not illness<br />
					there is nothing to be done through medicine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so did I, Māgandiya,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord at that time uttered this solemn utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the wanderer Māgandiya spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, good Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">For I too, good Gotama, have heard of this<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Health is the highest gain, <span class="mozp">Nibbāna</span> the highest bliss."</p>

					<p class="f4">So that this agrees, good Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But as to what you heard, Māgandiya,<br />

					<p class="f4">what is that health, what is that Nibbāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Māgandiya, it is like<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> a man blind from birth<br />

					<p class="f4">But some man might deceive him with a greasy grimy coarse robe, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Or was it from faith in the man with vision?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not knowing, good Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">It was from faith in the man with vision."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Māgandiya,<br />
