					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Kurus -<br />
					the market town of the Kurus was called Kammāssadhamma -<br />
					on a spreading of grass<br />
					in the fire-room<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of a brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having dressed early in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Kammāssadhamma for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having walked in Kammāssadhamma for almsfood,<br />
					returning from his alms-gathering after the meal,<br />
					having plunged into a forest thicket,<br />
					he sat down at the root of a tree<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt502" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg502"><span class="f2">[502]</span></a> Then the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					who was constantly pacing up and down<br />
					and roaming about on foot,<br />
					approached the fire-room<br />
					of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Māgaṇḍiya<br />
					saw the spreading of grass<br />
					made ready in the fire-room<br />
					of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan;<br />
					seeing it, he spoke thus<br />
					to the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For whom is this spreading of grass laid down<br />
					in the good Bhāradvāja's fire-room?</p>

					<p class="f4">It seems like a recluse's steeping place."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Māgaṇḍiya, there is the recluse Gotama,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					and about this revered Gotama<br />
					a lovely reputation has gone abroad thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed the Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with right knowledge and conduct,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					incomparable trainer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and men,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That sleeping place<br />
					is ready for this good Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, good Bhāradvāja,<br />
					we are seeing a poor sight<br />
					in seeing the sleeping place<br />
					of the good Gotama,<br />
					the destroyer of growth."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> "Mind what you say,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					mind what you say, Māgaṇḍiya.</p>

					<p class="f4">For many learned nobles<br />
					and learned brahmans<br />
					and learned householders<br />
					and learned recluses<br />
					have great faith in this good Gotama,<br />
					and are trained in the ariyan right path,<br />
					in <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					in what is skilled."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"If we could only see that revered Gotama<br />
					face to face, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					face to face would we say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama<br />
					is a destroyer of growth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is handed down thus<br />
					in a discourse of ours."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it is not disagreeable to the good Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					I will tell this to the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is of no consequence<br />
					if the good Bhāradvāja should tell him<br />
					just what has been said."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					with purified deva-hearing<br />
					surpassing that of men,<br />
					heard this conversation<br />
					between the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan<br />
					and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the fire-room<br />
					of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the spreading of grass<br />
					that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					and having conversed<br />
					in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There was some conversation, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					between you<br />
					and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya<br />
					<a id="pt503" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg503"><span class="f2">[503]</span></a> concerning this same grass spreading."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said<br />
					the brahman Bhāradvāja,<br />
					greatly moved and startled,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But this was the very thing<br />
					I wanted to tell the good Gotama,<br />
					but the revered Gotama anticipated me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this conversation<br />
					between the Lord<br />
					and the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan<br />
					was interrupted<br />
					when the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					who was constantly pacing up and down<br />
					and roaming about on foot,<br />
					approached the Lord<br />
					in the fire-room<br />
					of the brahman of the Bhāradvāja clan;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to him:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					the eye delights in material shapes,<br />

					<p class="f4">Was it on account of this, Magandiya,<br />
					that you said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just on account of this did I say, good Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					when I was formerly a householder,<br />

					revelled in them -<br />
					in material shapes cognisable by the eye, agreeable, pleasant

					<p class="f4">I did not envy them:<br />

					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					<a id="pt505" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg505"><span class="f2">[505]</span></a> stands firm on reaching<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> a <i>deva</i>-like happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having behaved well in body,<br />
					having behaved well in speech,<br />
					having behaved well in thought,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />

					<p class="f4">Surrounded there in the Nandana Grove by a throng of nymphs,<br />

					<p class="f4">He might see a householder<br />
					or a householder's son<br />
					endowed and provided with the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Māgaṇḍiya?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that young deva,<br />
					surrounded by a throng of nymphs in the Nandana Grove,<br />
					endowed and provided with the five deva-like strands of sense-pleasures<br />

					would he envy that householder<br />

					or their five strands of human sense-pleasures,<br />
					and revert to human sense-pleasures?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, good Gotama. What is the reason for this ? It is that deva-like sense-pleasures are more wonderful and excellent than human sense-pleasures."

					<p class="f4">what is that health, what is that Nibbāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
