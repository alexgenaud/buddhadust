					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta was walking on tour<br />
					near the Northern Mountain<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					together with a large Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk<br />
					who had spent the rains near Rājagaha<br />
					approached the Northern Mountain<br />
					and the venerable Sāriputta;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br />
					to this monk<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, your reverence,<br />
					that the Lord is well and strong?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord is well and strong, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And I hope, your reverence,<br />
					that the Order of monks is well and strong?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Order of monks is also well and strong, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is there, your reverence,<br />
					a brahman named Dhānañjāni<br />
					near the Taṇḍulapāla Gateway.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I hope, your reverence,<br />
					that the brahman named Dhānañjāni<br />
					is well and strong?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence, the brahman Dhānañjāni is also well and strong."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, your reverence,<br />
					that the brahman Dhānañjāni is being diligent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How could the brahman Dhānañjāni be diligent, your reverence?</p>

					<p class="f4">Under the king's patronage, your reverence,<br />
					the brahman Dhānañjāni plunders brahman householders;<br />
					and under the patronage of the brahman householders<br />
					he plunders the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">His wife<br />
					who had faith<br />
					and whom he had married<br />
					from a family that has faith<br />
					has died,<br />
					and he has married another wife<br />
					who has no faith<br />
					and who comes from a family that has no faith."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is indeed bad hearing,<br />
					your reverence;<br />
					indeed, your <a id="pg373"><span class="f2 g"><b>[373]</b></span></a> reverence,<br />
					it is bad hearing<br />
					that we hear the brahman Dhānañjāni is negligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps sometime,<br />
					somewhere<br />
					we might meet the brahman Dhānañjāni,<br />
					perhaps there might be some conversation."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					having stayed near the Northern Mountain for as long as he found suitable,<br />
					set out on tour for Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking on tour<br />
					he gradually arrived at Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta stayed near Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo Grove<br />
					at the squirrels' feeding-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					dressing in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Rājagaha for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman Dhānañjāni was having cows milked<br />
					in a cow-pen outside the town.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the venerable Sāriputta, had walked for alms in Rājagaha<br />
					and was returning from the alms-gathering<br />
					after the meal,<br />
					he approached the brahman Dhānañjāni.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Dhānañjāni saw the venerable Sāriputta coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he approached the venerable Sāriputta;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Drink some of this milk, good Sāriputta,<br />
					until it is time for a meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, brahman,<br />
					I have finished with eating for today.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will take my day-sojoum<br />
					at the root of a tree -<br />
					you could come there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"<br />
					the brahman Dhānañjāni answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the brahman Dhānañjāni had had breakfast,<br />
					he approached the venerable Sāriputta;<br />
					having approached<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br />
					to the brahman Dhānañjāni<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope that you are being diligent, Dhānañjāni?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How could I be diligent, good Sāriputta,<br />
					when there are my parents to support,<br />
					my wife and children to support,<br />
					my slaves,<br />
					servants<br />
					and work-people to support,<br />
					when there are services to perform<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> for friends and acquaintances,<br />
					services to perform for kith and kin,<br />
					services to perform for guests,<br />
					rites to perform<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> for the ancestors,<br />
					rites to perform for the <i>devatās,</i> duties to perform<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> for the king -<br />
					and this body too must be satisfied and looked after."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Dakkhiṇāgiri. <i>MA.</i> iii. 429 says <i>giri</i> is the mountain slope, and that this was the name of the northern part of the mountainous country surrounding <span class="mozp">Rājagaha.</span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> One of the lesser gateways of Rājagaha, <i>MA.</i> iii. 429.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>karaṇīyam kātabbaṁ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> As above paragraph <i>mutatis mutandis.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>sahetukā dhammikā kammantā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>puññaṁ paṭipadaṁ.</i> Here, as frequently, <i>puñña</i> as the opposite of <i>pāpa,</i> evil, is "good" rather than "merit."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This and the following similes as at <i>M.</i> i. 243-244, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> with the longer list of devas at <i>M.</i> i. 289.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The idea no doubt is that Sāriputta missed an opportunity of telling the brahman about <i>dhamma</i> and spoke only of <i>hīna Brahmaloka,</i> a "low" world instead of the <i>lokuitara dhamma,</i> the supermundane <i>dhamma</i> (see <a href="mn.096.horn.pts.htm">Sta. No. 96,</a> above, p. 369), towards the winning of which the teaching of the Buddha is directed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> No mention of <i>hīna,</i> low or lesser, Brahma-world here. This raises the problem of whether Dhānañjāni profited more from <i>Sāriputta's</i> teaching than the latter knew or had attempted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> A rebuke recorded to have been given by Gotama to Sāriputta, "the beloved disciple," is of rare occurrence. See above, p. 131 and Intr. p. xxvi.</p>
