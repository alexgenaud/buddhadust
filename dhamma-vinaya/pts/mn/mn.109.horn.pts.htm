					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the palace of Migāra's mother in the Eastern Monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Lord was sitting down in the open air<br />
					on the night of a full moon<br />
					on an Observance day,<br />
					the fifteenth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					surrounded by an Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					arranging his upper robe over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, would ask the Lord about a particular matter<br />
					if the Lord grants me the opportunity<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, monk, you,<br />
					having sat down on your own seat,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					ask what you desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk, having sat down on his own seat,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg66"><span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span></a> "Are there not, revered sir,<br />
					these five groups of grasping,<br />
					that is to say,<br />

					the group of grasping after feeling,<br />
					the group of grasping after perception,<br />
					the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,<br />

					<p class="f4">"These, monk, are the five groups of grasping,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, revered sir,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and this monk,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what, revered sir, is the root<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are just these five groups of grasping<br />

					<p class="f4">Or is there grasping<br />

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, monk, these five groups of grasping<br />
					are not the whole of grasping,<br />
					and yet there is no grasping<br />
					apart from the five groups of grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, monks, is attachment to<br />
					and desire for<br />
					the five groups of grasping,<br />
					then that is grasping."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Might it be, revered sir,<br />
					that there is diversity<br />

					<p class="f4">"It might be, monk,"</p>

					<p class="f4">the Lord said.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It occurs to someone here, monk:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The fifteenth day of the lunar month. <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iii. 100, <i>Vin.</i> i. 104.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iv. 75 <i>f.</i> explains that this monk was the Elder in an Order of sixty who were staying in a forest. If he stood, they would stand, thereby showing disrespect to the Tathāgata; but if they sat while their teacher was speaking they would be showing disrespect to him. But if the teacher sat they too would sit and so, all being tranquil, they would be able to receive the teaching on <i>dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>phassa.</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 78 says that if one is impinged upon then one feels, perceives, wills.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>D.</i> ii. 62-63 where name-and-shape and consciousness are mutually dependent. Here re-linking consciousness is meant, <i>MA.</i> iv. 78.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i. 300.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>vedanā,</i> feeling, is omitted in the text, no doubt in error.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>iti kira bho.</i> This looks like a case where a monk, in thought, applies <i>bho</i> to himself. Or else he is thinking (as translated at <i>K.S.</i> iii. 88) "so then you say."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> "In what self do these results appear? Speaking thus, he fell into the view of eternalism," <i>MA.</i> iv. 79.</p>

Explained at <i>UdA.</i> 352. It means to by-pass, deviate from, outstrip, run ahead of, "go one better than," "improve upon."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>paṭicca-vinītā,</i> trained in conditions. <i>S.</i> iii. 104 reads <i>paṭipucchā vinītā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Those referred to in <i>MA.</i> on this Sta. as having lived in the forest learning meditation under a teacher who, not satisfied with their progress, brought them to the Lord and himself questioned Him. <i>MA.</i> iv. 79 says that they had meditated on the usual subjects of meditation but now, mastering a new one and not moving from their cross-legged positions, they attained arahantship on the very seats on which they were sitting.</p>
