					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Great Grove in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a number of monks declared<br />
					in the Lord's presence<br />
					that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We comprehend that destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is <a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a>  what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so."</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta the son of a Licchavi<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> heard<br />
					that a number of monks declared<br />
					in the Lord's presence<br />
					that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We comprehend that destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sunakkhatta the son of a Licchavi approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached<br />
					and greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Sunakkhatta the son of a Licchavi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, revered sir,<br />
					that a number of monks declared<br />
					in the Lord's presence<br />
					that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We comprehend that destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, did those monks<br />
					who declared in the Lord's presence<br />
					that they had profound knowledge, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We comprehend that destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so' -<br />
					did they declare properly<br />
					that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					or were there perhaps some monks there<br />
					who, out of over-conceit,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> declared that they had profound knowledge?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sunakkhatta, among the monks<br />
					who in my presence<br />
					declared that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We comprehend that destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so,'<br />
					there were some monks there<br />
					who declared properly<br />
					that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					but there were also some monks there<br />
					who, out of over-conceit,<br />
					declared that they had profound knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					those monks who declared properly<br />
					that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					for them it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to those monks, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					who, out of over-conceit,<br />
					declared that they had profound knowledge,<br />
					it occurs to the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I should teach these <i>Dhamma</i>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so it is in this case, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					that it occurs to the Tathāāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I should teach these <i>Dhamma</i>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But there are moreover<br />
					some foolish persons here<br />
					who, having constructed a question,<br />
					approach the Tathāāgata<br />
					and ask (him).</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					this too occurs to the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I should teach these <i>Dhamma</i>,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and it does not occur to him (to think) otherwise."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is the right time for this, Lord,<br />
					it is the right time for this, Well-farer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks, having heard from the Lord whatever <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					the Lord may teach,<br />
					will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Sunakkhatta, listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					Sunakkhatta the son of a Licchavi answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus: <a id="pg39"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">"These five, Sunakkhatta, are the strands of sense-pleasure.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shapes cognisable by the eye,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognisable by the ear,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smells cognisable by the nose,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognisable by the tongue,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touches cognisable by the body,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4"> These, Ānanda, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when some individual here<br />
					may be set on the material things of the world,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the talk of the individual<br />
					who is set on the material things of the world<br />
					follows a pattern<br />
					in accordance with which he reflects and ponders,<br />
					and he associates with that man<br />
					under whom he finds felicity;<br />
					but when there is talk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> connected with imperturbability<br />
					he does not listen,<br />
					does not lend ear,<br />
					does not arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he does not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he does not find felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta, it is like a man<br />
					who may have been absent a long time<br />
					from his own village or market town<br />
					and may see a man recently come from that village or market town;<br />
					he would ask him about the safety of that village or market town<br />
					and about the plentifulness of the food and absence of sickness;<br />
					that man might speak to him about the safety of that village or market town<br />
					and about the plentifulness of the food and absence of sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Sunakkhatta?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not that man listen,<br />
					lend ear,<br />
					arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<br />
					and would he not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he found felicity?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Sunakkhatta, the situation exists<br />
					when some individual here may be set on the material things of the world,<br />
					and the talk of the individual<br />
					who is set on the material things of the world<br />
					follows a pattern<br />
					in accordance with which he reflects and ponders,<br />
					and he associates with that man<br />
					under whom he finds felicity;<br />
					but when there is talk connected with imperturbability<br />
					he does not listen,<br />
					does not lend ear,<br />
					does not arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<br />
					and he does not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he does not find felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should be spoken of as an individual who is set on the material things of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg40"><span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span></a> But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when some individual here<br />
					may be set on imperturbability,<br />
					and the talk of the individual, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					who is set on imperturbability<br />
					follows a pattern<br />
					in accordance with which he reflects and ponders,<br />
					and he associates with that man<br />
					under whom he finds felicity;<br />
					but when there is talk connected with the material things of the world<br />
					he does not listen,<br />
					does not lend ear,<br />
					does not arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<br />
					and he does not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he does not find felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta, as a sere leaf,<br />
					loosened from its stalk,<br />
					cannot become green again,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when the fetter of the material things of the world<br />
					is loosened by that individual<br />
					who is set on imperturbability<br />
					he should be spoken of<br />
					as an individual who is set on imperturbability<br />
					for he is released from the material things of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when some individual here<br />
					may be set on no-thing,<br />
					and the talk of the individual, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					who is set on the plane of no-thing<br />
					follows a pattern<br />
					in accordance with which he reflects and ponders,<br />
					and he associates with that man<br />
					under whom he finds felicity;<br />
					but when there is talk connected with imperturbability<br />
					he does not listen,<br />
					does not lend ear,<br />
					does not arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<br />
					and he does not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he does not find felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta, as a rock<br />
					that is broken in two<br />
					cannot become whole again,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so, Sunakkhatta, when the fetter of imperturbability<br />
					is broken by that individual<br />
					who is set on the plane of no-thing,<br />
					he should be spoken of<br />
					as an individual who is set on the plane of no-thing<br />
					for he is released from the fetter of imperturbability.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when some individual here<br />
					may be set on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					and the talk of the individual, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					who is set on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception<br />
					follows a pattern<br />
					in accordance with which he reflects and ponders,<br />
					and he associates with that man<br />
					under whom he finds felicity;<br />
					but when there is talk connected with the plane of no-thing<br />
					he does not listen,<br />
					does not lend ear,<br />
					does not arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<br />
					and he does not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he does not find felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					who after eating a meal of dainties<br />
					might throw away (the remains).</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Sunakkhatta?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man have any further desire for that meal?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> "No, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">That meal, revered sir, is considered to be objectionable."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when that fetter of the plane of no-thing<br />
					is laid aside by the individual<br />
					who is set on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					he should be spoken of<br />
					as an individual who is set on the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception<br />
					for he is released from the fetter<br />
					of the plane of no-thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when some individual here<br />
					may be set on perfect nibbāna,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the talk of the individual, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					who is set on perfect nibbāna<br />
					follows a pattern<br />
					in accordance with which he reflects and ponders;<br />
					and he associates with that man<br />
					under whom he finds felicity;<br />
					but when there is talk connected with the plane of neithcr-perception-nor-non-perception<br />
					he does not listen,<br />
					does not lend ear,<br />
					does not arouse his mind to profound knowledge,<br />
					and he does not associate with that man<br />
					under whom he does not find felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta, as a palm-tree<br />
					whose crown has been cut off<br />
					cannot grow again,<br />
					even so, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when the plane of neithcr-perception-nor-non-perception<br />
					is cut off for an individual who is set on perfect nibbāna,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree<br />
					that, eradicated, is not liable to rise up again in the future,<br />
					he should be spoken of as an individual<br />
					who is set on perfect nibbāna for he is released from the fetter<br />
					of the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					when it occurs to some monk here that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Craving has been called a dart<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> by the Recluse<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the virus of ignorance<br />
					wracks (a man) with desire,<br />
					attachment<br />
					and ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dart of craving<br />
					has been got rid of by me,<br />
					drained off is the virus of ignorance,<br />
					I am set on perfect nibbāna' -</p>

					<p class="f4">he may be thus proud of his existing goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may give himself up<br />
					to such things as are deleterious<br />
					to one who is set on perfect nibbāna:<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious vision of material shapes through the eye,<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious sounds through the ear<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious smells through the nose<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					he may give himself up <a id="pg42"><span class="f2 g"><b>[42]</b></span></a> to deleterious mental states through the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is given up to deleterious vision of material shapes through the eye,<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious sounds through the ear<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious smells through the nose<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious mental states through the mind,<br />
					attachment may assail his thought;<br />
					with his thought assailed by attachment<br />
					he may come to death<br />
					or to pain like unto death.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					a man were pierced by an arrow<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> that was thickly smeared with poison;<br />
					his friends and acquaintances,<br />
					kith and kin,<br />
					might procure a physician and surgeon;<br />
					that physician and surgeon<br />
					might cut round the opening of his wound with a knife;<br />
					having cut round the opening of the wound with the knife,<br />
					he might probe for the arrow with a (surgeon's) probe;<br />
					having probed for the arrow with the (surgeon's) probe,<br />
					he might extract the arrow,<br />
					he might drain off the virus<br />
					leaving some behind<br />
					but thinking none remained,<br />
					and he might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br />
					the arrow has been extracted from you,<br />
					the virus drained off<br />
					so that none is left,<br />
					there is no<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> danger for you,<br />
					but you should eat only beneficial foods<br />
					and take care<br />
					lest, eating deleterious foods,<br />
					your wound discharges.</p>

					<p class="f4">And from time to time<br />
					you should bathe the wound,<br />
					from time to time<br />
					you should anoint the opening of the wound,<br />
					but take care<br />
					lest, bathing the wound from time to time,<br />
					anointing the opening of the wound from time to time,<br />
					the old blood cakes on the wound.</p>

					<p class="f4">And take care<br />
					if you are anxious to go out<br />
					into the wind and the heat of the sun,<br />
					for unless you are careful<br />
					when you go out into the wind and the heat of the sun,<br />
					dust and dirt<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					may assail the opening of the wound.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, my good man,<br />
					take care of the wound,<br />
					the wound will heal.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It may occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The arrow has been extracted,<br />
					the virus drained off so that none remains,<br />
					and there is no danger for me,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and so he may eat only deleterious foods,<br />
					and while doing so his wound may discharge;<br />
					and he may not bathe the wound from time to time<br />
					nor anoint the opening of the wound from time to time;<br />
					not bathing the wound from time to time<br />
					nor anointing the opening of the wound from time to time,<br />
					the old blood may cake on the opening of the wound;<br />
					and if he is anxious to go out<br />
					into the wind and the heat of the sun,<br />
					dust and dirt may assail the opening of the wound;<br />
					and if he should not take care of the opening of the wound<br />
					the wound does not heal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both because he does precisely the deleterious things <a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a><br />
					and because,<br />
					although when the noisome virus was drained off<br />
					some remained,<br />
					the wound may increase in size.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">With the wound increased in size<br />
					he may come to death<br />
					or to pain like unto death -<br />
					even so, Sunakkhatta, the situation exists<br />
					when it might occur to some monk here that</p>

					<p class="f4">'Craving has been called a dart by the Recluse;<br />
					the virus of ignorance wracks (a man) with desire,<br />
					attachment<br />
					and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">That dart of craving has been got rid of by me,<br />
					drained off is the virus of ignorance,<br />
					I am set on perfect nibbāna' -</p>

					<p class="f4">he may be thus proud of his existing goal.</p>

					he may give himself up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					he may give himself up to deleterious mental states through the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is given up to deleterious vision of material shapes through the eye,<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious sounds through the ear<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious smells through the nose<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					while he is given up to deleterious mental states through the mind,<br />
					attachment may assail his thought;<br />
					with his thought assailed by attachment<br />
					he may come to death<br />
					or to pain like unto death.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this, Sunakkhatta, is death in the discipline for an ariyan:<br />
					when, disavowing the training,<br />
					he returns to the secular life;<br />
					and this, Sunakkhatta, is pain like unto death:<br />
					when he falls into a grievous<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this situation exists, Sunakkhatta,<br />

					<p class="f4">That dart of craving has been got rid of by me,<br />
					drained off is the virus of ignorance,<br />
					I am set on perfect nibbāna' -</p>

					<p class="f4">Precisely because lie is set on perfect nibbāna<br />
					he may not give himself up to those things<br />
					which are deleterious to one set on perfect nibbāna:<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious vision of material shapes through the eye,<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious sounds through the ear<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious smells through the nose<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious mental states through the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Attachment may not assail the thought<br />

					having cut round the opening of the wound with the knife,<br />
					he might probe for the arrow with a (surgeon's) probe;<br />
					having probed for the arrow with the (surgeon's) probe,<br />
					he might extract the arrow,<br />
					he might drain off the virus<br />
					with none remaining,<br />
					and he might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My good man,<br />
					the arrow has been extracted from you,<br />
					the virus drained off<br />
					so that none is left,<br />
					there is no danger for you,<br />
					but you should eat only beneficial foods<br />
					and take care<br />
					lest, eating deleterious foods,<br />
					your wound discharges.</p>

					<p class="f4">And from time to time<br />
					you should bathe the wound,<br />
					from time to time<br />
					you should anoint the opening of the wound,<br />
					but take care<br />
					lest, bathing the wound from time to time,<br />
					anointing the opening of the wound from time to time,<br />
					the old blood cakes on the wound.</p>

					<p class="f4">And take care<br />
					if you are anxious to go out<br />
					into the wind and the heat of the sun,<br />
					for unless you are careful<br />
					when you go out into the wind and the heat of the sun,<br />
					dust and dirt<br />
					may assail the opening of the wound.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, my good man,<br />
					take care of the wound,<br />
					the wound will heal.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It may occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">The arrow has been extracted,<br />
					the virus drained off<br />
					so that none remains,<br />
					and there is no danger for me,'</p>

					<p class="f4">but he may eat only beneficial foods,<br />
					and while doing so<br />
					his wound may not discharge;<br />
					and he may bathe the wound from time to time<br />
					and anoint the opening of the wound from time <a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> to time;<br />
					since he bathes the wound from time to time<br />
					and anoints the opening of the wound from time to time,<br />
					the old blood will not cake on the opening of the wound;<br />
					and if he is not anxious to go out into the wind and the heat of the sun,<br />
					dust and dirt will not assail the opening of the wound;<br />
					and if he should take care of the opening of the wound,<br />
					the wound heals.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both because he does only the beneficial things<br />
					and because the noisome virus is drained off with none remaining,<br />
					the wound will close up;<br />
					when the wound is closed by the skin<br />
					he will not come to death<br />
					or to pain like unto death -<br />
					even so, Sunakkhatta, the situation exists<br />
					when it might occur to some monk here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Craving has been called a dart by the Recluse;<br />
					the virus of ignorance wracks (a man) with desire,<br />
					attachment<br />
					and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">That dart of craving has been got rid of by me,<br />
					drained off is the virus of ignorance,<br />
					I am set on perfect nibbāna' -</p>

					<p class="f4">Precisely because lie is set on perfect nibbāna<br />
					he may not give himself up to those things<br />
					which are deleterious to one set on perfect nibbāna:<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious vision of material shapes through the eye,<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious sounds through the ear<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious smells through the nose<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					he may not give himself up to deleterious mental states through the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Attachment may not assail the thought<br />
					of one not given up to deleterious vision of material shapes through the eye
					of one not given up to deleterious sounds through the ear<br />
					of one not given up to deleterious smells through the nose<br />
					of one not given up to deleterious tastes through the tongue<br />
					of one not given up to deleterious touches through the body<br />
					of one not given up to deleterious mental states through the mind;<br />
					while his thought is not assailed by attachment,<br />
					he may not come to death<br />
					or to pain like unto death.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have made this simile, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					for the sake of clarifying the meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this is the meaning here:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The wound,' Sunakkhatta,<br />
					is a synonym for the six inner (sense-) fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The virus,' Sunakkhatta,<br />
					is a synonym for ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The arrow,' Sunakkhatta,<br />
					is a synonym for craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The (surgeon's) probe,' Sunakkhatta,<br />
					is a synonym for mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The knife' Sunakkhatta,<br />
					is a synonym for the ariyan wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The physician and surgeon,' Sunakkhatta,<br />
					is a synonym for the Tathāāgata,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					a monk who restrains himself<br />
					among the six fields of (sensory) impingement,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Clinging is the root of anguish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and having understood it so,<br />
					is without clinging,<br />
					freed by the destruction of clinging.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That he should focus his body on clinging<br />
					or devote his thought to it,<br />
					this situation does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					there were a bronze goblet,<br />
					fair and <a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> fragrant,<br />
					but charged with poison;<br />
					then a man might come along,<br />
					anxious to live,<br />
					anxious not to die,<br />
					anxious for happiness,<br />
					recoiling from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Sunakkhatta?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man drink out of this bronze goblet if he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having drunk from this,<br />
					I will come to death<br />
					or to pain like unto death'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					that monk who restrains himself<br />
					among the six fields of (sensory) impingement,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Clinging is the root of anguish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">having understood it so<br />
					is without clinging,<br />
					freed by the destruction of clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">That he should focus his body on clinging<br />
					or devote his thought to it -<br />
					this situation does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta, it is like a deadly poisonous snake;<br />
					and a man might come along<br />
					anxious to live,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					anxious not to die,<br />
					anxious for happiness,<br />
					recoiling from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Sunakkhatta?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man proffer<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> his hand or toe<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to that deadly poisonous snake<br />
					if he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If I am bitten by this,<br />
					I will come to death<br />
					or pain like unto death'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					that monk who restrains himself<br />
					among the six fields of (sensory) impingement,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Clinging is the root of anguish,'</p>

					<p class="f4">having understood it so<br />
					is without clinging,<br />
					freed by the destruction of clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">That he should focus his body on clinging<br />
					or devote his thought to it -<br />
					this situation does not exist."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, Sunakkhatta the son of a Licchavi rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Discourse to Sunakkhatta:<br />
					The Fifth</p>
