					<p class="f4">It may be that another monk here<br />
					does not attain final nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">While he rejoices in this equanimity,<br />

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Ānanda,<br />
					an ariyan disciple<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span> reflects thus:</p>

					that is to say the deliverance of thought without grasping.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So, Ānanda,<br />

					taught by means of this and that<br />
					has been the crossing of the flood,<br />
					taught the ariyan Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever, Ānanda, is to be done from compassion by a Teacher<br />
					seeking the welfare of disciples,<br />
					this has been done by me<br />
					out of compassion for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Ānanda,<br />
					are the roots of trees,<br />
					these are empty places.</p>

					<p class="f4">Meditate, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span></p>
