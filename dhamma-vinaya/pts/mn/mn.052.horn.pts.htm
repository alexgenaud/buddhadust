					<p class="f4">"Householder, the venerable Ānanda<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But what, revered Ānanda,<br />

					by wholly transcending the plane of infinite consciousness,<br />
					thinking:<br />
					'There is not anything,'<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the plane of no-thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He reflects on this and comprehends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This attainment of the plane of no-thing is also effected and thought out.</p>

					<p class="f4">But whatever is effected and thought out,<br />
					that is impermanent,<br />
					it is liable to stopping.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Firm in this,<br />
					he attains the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he does not attain the destruction of the cankers,<br />
					then by this attachment to <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					by this delight in <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					by the destruction<br />
					of the five fetters binding to this lower (shore),<br />
					he is of spontaneous uprising,<br />
					one who attains <i>nibbāna</i> there,<br />
					not liable to return from that world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, householder, is one thing<br />
					pointed out by the Lord who knows,<br />
					who sees,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened one,<br />
					whereby if a monk dwell diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					his mind not (yet) freed,<br />
					is freed;<br />
					and also the cankers,<br />
					not (yet) completely destroyed,<br />
					go to complete destruction;<br />
					and, too, he attains<br />
					the matchless security from the bonds,<br />
					not (yet) attained."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered Ānanda,<br />
					it is as though a man who was seeking<br />
					for one opening to (some hidden) treasure<br />
					were to come at one and the same time<br />
					on eleven openings to the treasure.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt353" href="../../pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm#pg353"><span class="f2">[353]</span></a> Even so do I, revered sir,<br />
					in seeking for one <a id="pg18"><span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span></a> door to the deathless<br />
					come to hear<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at one and the same time<br />
					of eleven doors to the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">And too, revered sir,<br />
					it is like a man's house<br />
					that has eleven doors;<br />
					if his house were on fire<br />
					he could make himself safe<br />
					by any one of the doors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so can I, revered sir,<br />
					make myself safe by any one<br />
					of these eleven doors to the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, revered sir,<br />
					members of other sects<br />
					will look about for a fee for the teacher,<br />
					but why should not I pay honour<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka,<br />
					having had the Order of monks<br />
					that was at Pāṭaliputta and Vesālī<br />
					gathered together,<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served and satisfied them<br />
					with sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					and presented each monk<br />
					with a separate pair of cloths;<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda<br />
					he presented a set of three robes<br />
					and had a dwelling-place<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that cost five hundred pieces<br />
					built for the venerable Ānanda.</p>
