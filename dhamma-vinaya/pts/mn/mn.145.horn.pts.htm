					in the Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's, monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"If the people of Sunāparanta<br />
					deprive me of life<br />
					with a sharp knife, revered sir,<br />
					it will be thus for me there:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are disciples of the Lord<br />
					who, disgusted by the body<br />
					and the life-principle<br />
					and ashamed of them,<br />
					look about for a knife<br />
					(with which to kill themselves).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, Puṇṇa,<br />

					<p class="f4">You, Punna, now do that<br />
					for which you deem the time is right."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said<br />
					and having given thanks for it,<br />
					rose from his seat<br />
					and greeted the Lord<br />
					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					packed away his lodging<br />
					and, taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					set out on tour for the Sunāparanta district.</p>

					<p class="f4">Walking on tour,<br />
					he gradually arrived at the Sunāparanta district.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the venerable Punṇa stayed in the district among the people of Sunāparanta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg322"><span class="f2 g"><b>[322]</b></span></a> during the same rainy season<br />
					the venerable Puṇṇa established as many as five hundred lay-devotees,<br />
					as many as five hundred female lay-devotees,<br />
					and he realised the three knowledges.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after a time<br />
					the venerable Puṇṇa attained final nibbāna.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A number of monks approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, that young man of family<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> named Puṇṇa<br />
					who was exhorted by the Lord with an exhortation in brief,<br />
					has died.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn,<br />
					what his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Clever, monks, was Puṇṇa<br />
					the young man of family;<br />
					he followed after dhamma<br />
					according to the various parts of dhamma;<br />
					and he did not annoy me<br />
					with questionings about dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Puṇṇa the young man of family<br />
					has gained final nibbāna, monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 85 says he was a dweller in Sunāparanta, and there were four places there where he stayed.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Or, "curse." See <i>B.D.</i> ii. 171, n. 3, also p. 269; also <i>B.D.</i> iii. 344 (<i>Vin.</i> iv. 309) where "revile" and "abuse" are defined much as they are at <i>MA.</i> v. 85.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 85 says a four-handed stick or a club of twigs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>satthahāraka,</i> or an assassin. But see Pārājika III (<i>Vin.</i> iii. 73) to which <i>MA.</i> v. 85 refers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>damupasama.</i> <i>MA.</i> v. 86 says that in this Sta. <i>dama</i> is <i>khanti,</i> forbearance or patience, and <i>upasmma</i> has the same meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 92 says he attained final nibbāna in the element of nibbāna that has no substrate for rebirth remaining. The people reverenced his body for a week and then, having collected sweet scented sticks, they cremated it, took away the remains and built a cetiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> I do not know why PunnṆ is here referred to as kulapvltu. It is perhaps to show he died young.</p>
