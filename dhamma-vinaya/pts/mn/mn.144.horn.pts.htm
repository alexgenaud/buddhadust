<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya Sutta 144. Sāriputta and Maha Cunda visit Channa who is dying a painful death. Channa announces he will 'take the knife' (commit suicide). Sāriputta questions him as to his understanding of Dhamma and Maha Cunda recites for him a saying of the Buddha warning against the wavering that results from attachments. Later, after Channa has 'taken the knife' Sāriputta questions the Buddha as to Channa's fate. The Buddha states that his was a blameless end." />

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					emerging from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the venerable Cunda the Great;<br />
