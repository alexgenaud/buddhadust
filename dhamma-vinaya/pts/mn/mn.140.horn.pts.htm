<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 140. Pukkusati, who was a wanderer who had become a follower of the Buddha without ever having met him, finds himself lodged in the same shed with him. The Buddha instructs him in great detail concerning the attitudes to take towards all the characteristics of existence such as to attain an unshakable calm. He requests ordination, but is not equipped with the necessary bowl and robes. Setting out to get such he is killed by a bull. The Buddha tells the other Bhikkhus he was reborn as a non-returner." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord, walking on tour among the people of Magadha, arrived at Rājagaha and approached the potter, Bhaggava;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having approached, he spoke thus to Bhaggava the potter:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it is not inconvenient to you, Bhaggava,<br />
					I would spend one night in your dwelling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not convenient to me, revered sir.<br />
					For there is here one gone forth<br />
					who came before you to stay.<br />
					But if he allow it, do stay, revered sir,<br />
					according to your pleasure."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><b>[238]</b></span> At that time there was a young man of family called Pukkusāti<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who had gone forth from home into homelessness<br />
					through faith in the Lord.<br />
					He it was that had arrived first at that potter's dwelling.<br />
					Then the Lord approached the venerable Pukkusāti<br />
					having approached, he spoke thus to the venerable Pukkusāti:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it is not inconvenient to you, monk,<br />
					I will spend a night in the dwelling."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Spacious,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> friend,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is the potter's dwelling;<br />
					let the venerable one stay according to his pleasure."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having entered the potter's dwelling<br />
					and laid down a spreading of grass to one side,<br />
					sat down cross-legged,<br />
					keeping his back erect<br />
					and arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lord passed much of that night sitting down.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Pukkusāti too<br />
					spent much of that night sitting down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This young man of respectable family<br />
					certainly comports himself pleasantly.<br />
					Suppose I were to question him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Pukkusāti:</p>

					<p class="f4">"On account of whom have you, monk, gone forth?<br />
					Who is your teacher?<br />
					Whose <i>Dhamma</i> do you profess?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is, friend, the recluse Gotama,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone <a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a> forth from the Sakyan clan;<br />
					concerning this Lord Gotama a lovely reputation has gone abroad thus:<br />
					He is indeed Lord, perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with (right) conduct and knowledge,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					knower of the world(s),<br />
					matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">On account of this Lord have I gone forth,<br />
					and this Lord is my teacher;<br />
					I profess this Lord's <i>Dhamma.</i>"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But where, monk, is this Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					staying now?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is a town called Sāvatthī, friend,<br />
					in the northern districts;<br />
					this Lord, perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					is now staying there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you, monk, ever seen this Lord?<br />
					If you saw him would you know him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend, I have never seen this Lord,<br />
					so I would not know him if I saw him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This young man of respectable family<br />
					has gone forth on account of me.<br />
					Suppose I were to teach him <i>dhamma?"</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And the Lord addressed the venerable Pukkusāti, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you dhamma, monk;<br />
					listen carefully, pay attention and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend,"<br />
					the venerable Pukkusāti answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monk, this man has six elements,<br />
					six fields of (sense-)impingement,<br />
					eighteen mental ranges,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					four resolves.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Where there is stability,<br />
					conceit and boasting do not continue in existence,<br />
					and when they do not continue in existence<br />
					the sage is said to be at peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">He<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> should not be slothful in wisdom,<br />
					he should guard the truth,<br />
					cultivate relinquishment,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and train himself for peace itself.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the exposition of the analysis of the six elements:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'This man has six elements,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">To the element of extension,<br />
					the liquid element,<br />
					the element of radiation,<br />
					of motion,<br />
					of <i>ākāsa,</i><br />
					of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said,<br />
					'This man has six elements,'<br />
					it is said in reference to this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'This man has six fields of (sense-)impingement,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">To the field of visual impingement,<br />
					of auditory impingement,<br />
					of olfactory impingement,<br />
					of gustatory impingement,<br />
					of tactile impingement,<br />
					of mental impingement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'This man has six fields of (sense-)impingement,'<br />
					it is said in reference to this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'This man has eighteen mental ranges,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen a material shape with the eye,<br />
					one ranges over the material shape that gives rise to joy,<br />
					ranges over the material shape that gives rise to sorrow,<br />
					ranges over the material shape that gives rise to equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear,<br />
					one ranges over the sound that gives rise to joy,<br />
					ranges over the sound that gives rise to sorrow,<br />
					ranges over the sound that gives rise to equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having smelt a smell with the nose,<br />
					one ranges over the smell that gives rise to joy,<br />
					ranges over the smell that gives rise to sorrow,<br />
					ranges over the smell that gives rise to equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having savoured a taste with the tongue,<br />
					one ranges over the taste that gives rise to joy,<br />
					ranges over the taste that gives rise to sorrow,<br />
					ranges over the taste that gives rise to equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having felt a touch with the body,<br />
					one ranges over the touch that gives rise to joy,<br />
					ranges over the touch that gives rise to sorrow,<br />
					ranges over the touch that gives rise to equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognised a mental state with the mind,<br />
					one ranges over the mental state that gives rise to joy,<br />
					ranges over the mental state that gives rise to sorrow,<br />
					ranges over the mental state that gives rise to equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there are six ranges for joy,<br />
					six for sorrow,<br />
					six for equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'This man has eighteen mental ranges,'<br />
					it is said in reference to this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'This man has four resolves,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">To the resolve for wisdom,<br />
					the resolve for truth,<br />
					the resolve for relinquishment,<br />
					the resolve for calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said<br />
					'This man has four resolves,'<br />
					it is said in reference to this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, when it is said:<br />
					'He should not be slothful in wisdom,<br />
					he should guard the truth,<br />
					cultivate relinquishment<br />
					and train himself for peace itself,'<br />
					in reference to what is it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monk, is one not slothful in wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements:<br />
					the element of extension,<br />
					the liquid element,<br />
					the element of radiation,<br />
					of motion,<br />
					of <i>ākāsa,</i><br />
					of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the element of extension?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The element of extension may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the internal element of extension?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is hard, solid, is internal,<br />
					referable to an individual and derived therefrom,<br />
					that is to say:<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the internal element of <a id="pg288"><span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span></a> extension<br />
					and whatever is the external element of extension,<br />
					just these are the element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					this should be seen as it really is, thus:<br />
					This is not mine,<br />
					this am I not,<br />
					this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus as it really is<br />
					by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					he disregards the element of extension,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of the element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the liquid element?</p>

					<p class="f4">The liquid element may be internal,<br />
					it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the internal liquid element?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is liquid, fluid, is internal,<br />
					referable to an individual<br />

					that is to say:<br />
					bile,<br />
					phlegm,<br />
					pus,<br />
					blood,<br />
					sweat,<br />

					or whatever other thing is liquid, fluid, is internal,<br />

					and derived therefrom,<br />
					this, monk, is called the internal liquid element.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal liquid element<br />

					just these are the liquid element.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					this should be seen as it really is, thus:<br />
					This is not mine,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus as it really is<br />
					by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					he disregards the liquid element,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of the liquid element.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the element of radiation?</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of radiation may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the internal element of radiation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is heat, warmth, is internal,<br />
					referable to an individual<br />
					and derived therefrom,<br />
					such as that by which one is vitalised<br />
					and that by which one is consumed,<br />
					and that by which one is burnt up,<br />
					and that which one has munched, drunk, eaten and tasted<br />
					which is properly transformed (in digestion),<br />
					or whatever other thing is heat, warmth, is internal,<br />

					this, monk, is called the internal element of radiation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of radiation<br />

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the element of motion?</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of motion may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the internal element of motion?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is motion, wind, is internal,<br />
					referable to an individual<br />

					such as winds going upwards,<br />
					winds going downwards,<br />
					winds in the abdomen,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg289"><span class="f2 g"><b>[289]</b></span></a> And what, monk, is the element of space?</p>

					<p class="f4">The element of space may be internal, it may be external.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monk, is the internal element of space?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is space, spacious, is internal,<br />
					referable to an individual<br />
					and derived therefrom,<br />
					such as the auditory and nasal orifices,<br />
					the door of the mouth<br />
					and that by which one swallows<br />
					what is munched, drunk, eaten and tasted,<br />
					and where this remains,<br />
					and where it passes out (of the body) lower down,<br />
					or whatever other thing is space, spacious, is internal,<br />
					referable to an individual<br />
					and derived therefrom,<br />
					this, monk, is called the internal element of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is an internal element of space<br />
					and whatever is the external element of space,<br />
					just these are the element of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					this should be seen as it really is, thus:<br />
					This is not mine,<br />
					this am I not,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus as it really is<br />
					by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					he disregards the element of space,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of the element of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the consciousness that remains is quite pure, quite clean,<br />
					he knows something by means of that consciousness:<br />
					he discriminates pleasure<br />
					and he discriminates pain<br />
					and he discriminates what is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monk, because of impingement<br />
					there arises an experience of pleasure<br />
					it it is a pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, experiencing that pleasant feeling,<br />
					comprehends that he is experiencing a pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the cessation of the impingement<br />
					whence comes that experience of pleasure he comprehends:<br />
					'The pleasant feeling arisen on account of an impingement<br />
					experienced as a complemental<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> pleasant experience<br />
					is stopped, is allayed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monk, because of impingement<br />
					there arises an experience of pain<br />
					it it is a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, experiencing that painful feeling,<br />
					comprehends that he is experiencing a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the cessation of the impingement<br />
					whence comes that experience of pain he comprehends:<br />
					'The painful feeling arisen on account of an impingement<br />
					experienced as a complemental painful experience<br />
					is stopped, is allayed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monk, because of impingement<br />
					there arises an experience of what is neither painful nor pleasant<br />
					it is a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, experiencing that feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					comprehends that he is experiencing a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the cessation of the impingement<br />

					'The feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant<br />
					arisen on account of an impingement<br />

					is stopped, is allayed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, it is like the heat obtained,<br />
					the light produced<br />
					from the contact and friction of two sticks;<br />
					when the two sticks are separated<br />
					their complemental heat is stopped, is allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monk, <a id="pg290"><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></a> does a pleasant feeling arise<br />
					on account of the impingement of an experience of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, experiencing that pleasant feeling,<br />
					comprehends that he is experiencing a pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the cessation of the impingement<br />
					whence comes that experience of pleasure he comprehends:<br />
					'The pleasant feeling arisen on account of an impingement<br />
					experienced as a complemental pleasant experience<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, monk, does a painful feeling arise<br />
					on account of the impingement of an experience of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, experiencing that painful feeling,<br />
					comprehends that he is experiencing a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the cessation of the impingement<br />
					whence comes that experience of pain he comprehends:<br />
					'The painful feeling<br />
					arisen on account of an impingement<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, monk, does a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant arise<br />
					on account of the impingement of an experience of what is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, experiencing that feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,<br />

					it is allayed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the equanimity that remains<br />
					is quite pure, quite cleansed,<br />
					soft and pliable and resplendent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, it is like a skilled goldsmith or  a goldsmith's apprentice preparing a furnace;<br />
					when he has prepared the furnace<br />
					he lights the smelting-pot;<br />
					when he has lit the smelting-pot<br />
					he takes up the gold with tongs<br />
					and places it in the smelting-pot;<br />
					and then from time to time he blows on it,<br />
					from time to time he sprinkles water over it,<br />
					and from time to time he looks at it carefully<br />
					— that gold becomes clear, pure, cleansed,<br />
					(the impurities) removed,<br />
					free from dross,<br />
					soft and pliable and resplendent<br />
					so that whatever kind of ornament one requires,<br />
					a ring or earring or necklace or golden garland,<br />
					it is suitable for that purpose.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monk, the equanimity that then remains<br />
					is quite pure, quite cleansed,<br />
					soft and pliable and resplendent.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends thus:<br />
					'If I should focus this equanimity,<br />
					purified thus, cleansed thus,<br />
					on the plane of infinite ether<br />
					and should develop my thought in accordance with that,<br />
					then would this equanimity,<br />
					supported by this,<br />
					nourished by this,<br />
					stand firm in me for a very long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends thus:<br />

					<p class="f4">Do you, monk, remember my analysis in brief<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> of the six elements."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Pukkusāti thought:<br />
					"Indeed it is the Teacher that has come to me;<br />
					indeed it is the Well-farer that has come to me;<br />
					indeed it is the Fully Self-Awakened One that has come to me,"<br />
					and rising from his seat,<br />
					arranging his robe over one shoulder<br />
					and bowing his head to the Lord's feet,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A transgression, revered sir, has overcome me<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> in that<br />
					foolish, errant and unskilled as I was,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, monk, a transgression overcame you<br />

					you <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> supposed I could be addressed with the epithet 'friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, monk, seeing this transgression as a transgression,<br />
					confess it according to the rule,<br />
					we acknowledge it for you.<br />
					For this is growth, monk, in the discipline for an Ariyan,<br />
					that whoever, seeing a transgression as a transgression,<br />
					confesses it according to ru1e,<br />
					he comes to restraint in the future."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, may I receive ordination in the Lord's presence?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But are you, monk, complete as to bowl and robe?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, I am not complete as to bowl and robe."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monk, Tathāgatas do not ordain anyone not complete as to bowl and robe."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Pukkusāti,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br />
					having given thanks for it,<br />
					rising from his seat<br />
					greeted the Lord and,<br />
					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					departed in order to search for a bowl and robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But while he was touring about in search of a bowl and robe,<br />
					a cow swerved<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> and deprived him of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached, having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.<br />

					these monks spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That young man of family, Pukkusāti, revered sir,<br />
					whom the Lord exhorted with an exhortation in brief, has died.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span><br />

					the young man of family;<br />
					he followed after <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					according to the various parts of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					and he did not annoy me with questionings about <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Pukkusāti, the young man of family,<br />
					by the complete destruction of the five fetters binding to this lower (shore),<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> "This," <i>etaṃ,</i> appears to refer to "life-span," <i>āyu.,</i> so <i>MA.</i> v. 55: "however much this life-span is of 20,000 kappas ... it is not permanent or eternal, it is temporary, liable to deceasing, falling, breaking up and shattering; it is dogged by birth, bestrewn by disease, struck down by death; it is founded on anguish, with no authority, no refuge. ... All these perils are spoken of by the one phrase: 'this is constructed,'" <i>saṇkhatam etaṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>saṇkhatam etaṃ.</i> The meaning probably is that, however much one applies equanimity to the various meditative planes and develops thought according to them, <i>still</i> this life-span remains. It is therefore a construction: <i>saṇkhāra</i> (and hence impermanent, <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.050.pali.bd.htm#pg336"><i>M.</i> i. 336,</a> <i>sabbasaṇkhāresu aniccānupassino,</i> translated at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.050.horn.pts.htm#pg400"><i>M.L.S.</i> i. 400</a> as: beholding the impermanence of all constructions; and <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v277"><i>Dhp.</i> 277</a> <i>sabbe saṇkhārā aniccā,</i> impermanent are all the constructions), or it is a construct, <i>saṇkhata;</i> or it is constructed, <i>saṇkhata.</i> The underlying idea is one of activity (see <i>M.L.S.</i> i., Intr., p. xxv), a karmic "effecting" or bringing about, which, in this context above, is a result of the decision the meditator has just taken to focus his equanimity and develop his thought. But, as he immediately perceives, this will only lead to the constructing of new effects in the future. So he stills his mind in order to bring no new constructs into existence. Therefore, following his realisation that <i>saṇkhatam etaṃ,</i> he seeks to go no further with such mental activity as will bear future karmic fruit and <i>n'eva abhisaṇkharoti nābhisañcetayati,</i> neither constructs nor thinks out. At <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm#pg350"><i>M.</i> i. 350</a> the bhikkhu comprehends of each <i>jhāna,</i> of each <i>brahmavihāra</i> and of each of the first three meditative planes that it is "effected" (or constructed or produced-by past mental activity) and thought out (or planned) and is therefore impermanent (and all that this entails). So that here again it is implied, as above, that the realisation and comprehension of such impermanence is a stepping-stone to further progress on the Way, whereas the lack of realisation is a hindrance or obstacle to such progress.</p>
