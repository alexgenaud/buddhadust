					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As, your reverences,<br />
					among all creatures that can walk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					all pedal qualities are combined in an elephant's foot,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and as the elephant's foot is chief among these<br />
					in point of size,<br />
					so, your reverences,<br />
					all skilled states of mind<br />
					are included among the four ariyan truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Among the ariyan truth of anguish,<br />
					among the ariyan truth of the uprising of anguish,<br />
					among the ariyan truth of the stopping of anguish,<br />
					among the ariyan truth of the course<br />
					leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					is the ariyan truth of anguish?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is anguish<br />
					and ageing is anguish<br />
					and dying is anguish;<br />
					and grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					tribulation<br />
					and despair are anguish,<br />
					and not getting what one wants,<br />
					that too is anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">In brief<br />
					the five groups of grasping are anguish.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just these;<br />
					the group of grasping after material shape,<br />
					the group of grasping after feeling,<br />
					the group of grasping after perception,<br />
					the group of grasping after the habitual tendencies,<br />
					the group of grasping after consciousness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">The four great elements,<br />
					and the material shape that is derived<br />
					from the four great elements.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">this, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is not mine,<br />
					this am I not,<br />
					this is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen this thus<br />
					as it really is<br />
					by means of perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					he disregards the element of extension,<br />
					he cleanses his mind<br />
					of the element of extension.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg232"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span></a> There comes to be a time, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">So what of this short-lived body<br />
