<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 73.  Vacchagotta is given a lesson in brief concerning what is skillful and what is not skillful and becomes a bhikkhu. Having mastered what is necessary as a foundation he is told to master calm and insight in order to attain magic powers, recollection of past lives, knowledge of the outcome of deeds, and the destruction of the Asavas. He masters all this and becomes an Arahant."/>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the wanderer Vacchagotta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a long time since I had a conversation with the good Gotama.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were good if the revered Gotama were to teach me in brief what is skilled and what is unskilled."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, Vaccha, could teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled <a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> in brief;<br />
					and I, Vaccha, could teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, Vaccha, will teach you what is skilled and what is unskilled in brief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen to it,<br />
					attend carefully,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"the wanderer Vacchagotta answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Greed, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					absence of greed is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aversion, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					absence of aversion is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Confusion, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					absence of confusion is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three things that are unskilled, Vaccha,<br />
					the three that are skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Vaccha, onslaught on creatures<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> is unskill,<br />
					restraint from onslaught on creatures is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking what has not been given, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					restraint from taking what has not been given is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wrong conduct in regard to sense-pleasures, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					restraint from wrong conduct in regard to sense-pleasures is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lying speech, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					restraint from lying speech is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Slanderous speech, Vaccha, <a id="pt490" href="../../pali/mn/mn.073.pali.bd.htm#pg490"><span class="f2">[490]</span></a> is unskill,<br />
					restraint from slanderous speech is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Harsh speech, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					restraint from harsh speech is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Frivolous chatter, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					restraint from frivolous chatter is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Covetousness, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					absence of covetousness is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Malevolence, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					absence of malevolence is skill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wrong view, Vaccha, is unskill,<br />
					right view is skill.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten things that are unskilled, Vaccha,<br />
					and the ten that are skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving, Vaccha,<br />
					has been got rid of by a monk,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump<br />
					that can come to no further existence in the future,<br />
					he is a monk who is a perfected one,<br />
					canker-waned,<br />
					who has lived the life,<br />

					the freedom of mind<br />

					that are cankerless,<br />
					entering on them is abiding in them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not merely a hundred, Vaccha,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, by a reasoning of mind I already knew the mind of the monk Vacchagotta:<br />
