					<p class="f4">At one time, not long after the Lord's <i>parinibbāna,</i> the venerable Ānanda<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaja">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of the lady of Videha,<br />
					distrusting King Pajjota,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was having Rājagaha strengthened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					dressing early in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Rājagaha for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is still too early to walk for alms in Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to approach the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna<br />
					and his place of work?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda approached the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna and his place of work.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him he spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the good Ānanda come,<br />
					there is a welcome for the good Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is long since the good Ānanda made this opportunity,<br />
					that is for coming here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the good Ānanda sit down,<br />
					this seat is made ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna,<br />
					taking a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there even one monk, Ānanda,<br />
					who is possessed in every way<br />
					and in every part<br />
					of all those things<br />
					of which the good Gotama,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					was possessed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is not even one monk, brahman,<br />
					who is possessed in every way<br />
					and in every part<br />
					of all those things<br />
					of which the Lord was possessed,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, brahman, this Lord<br />
					was one to make arise a Way<br />
					that had not arisen (before),<br />
					<a id="pg59"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span></a>  to bring about a Way<br />
					not brought about (before),<br />
					to show a Way<br />
					not shown (before);<br />
					he was a knower of the Way,<br />
					an understander of the Way,<br />
					skilled in the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the disciples are now Way-followers<br />
					following after him."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But this conversation<br />
					between the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna<br />
					was interrupted,<br />
					for the brahman <span class="mozp">Vassakāra</span>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the chief minister in Magadha,<br />
					while inspecting the works near Rājagaha,<br />
					approached the venerable Ānanda<br />
					at the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna's place of work;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Ānanda;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the brahman <span class="mozp">Vassakāra</span>, the chief minister in Magadha,<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4"> "What now, Ānanda,<br />
					was the talk for which you were sitting here?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what was that talk of yours<br />
					that was interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, brahman,<br />
					the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there even one monk, Ānanda,<br />
					who is possessed in every way<br />
					and in every part<br />
					of all those things<br />
					of which the good Gotama,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					was possessed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, brahman, spoke thus to the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is not even one monk, brahman,<br />
					who is possessed in every way<br />
					and in every part<br />
					of all those things<br />
					of which the Lord was possessed,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, brahman, this Lord<br />
					was one to make arise a Way<br />
					that had not arisen (before),<br />
					to bring about a Way<br />
					not brought about (before),<br />
					to show a Way<br />
					not shown (before);<br />
					he was a knower of the Way,<br />
					an understander of the Way,<br />
					skilled in the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, was the conversation that was interrupted<br />
					between the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna and myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">For then you arrived."</p>

					<p class="f4">Good Ānanda, what meaning is to be ascribed<br />

					<p class="f4">"There are, brahman, ten satisfying things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that have been pointed out by the Lord who knows and sees,<br />

					<p class="f4">What are the ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brahman, a monk is moral,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he lives controlled<br />
					by the control of the Obligations,<br />
					endowed with (right) behaviour and pasture,<br />
					seeing peril in the slightest faults<br />
					and, undertaking them,<br />
					he trains himself<br />
					in the rules of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who has heard much,<br />
					remembers what he has heard,<br />
					stores up what he has heard;<br />
					those things which are lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle<br />
					and lovely at the ending<br />
					and which, with the meaning and the spirit,<br />
					declare the Brahma-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					perfectly purified,<br />
					such things are much heard by him,<br />
					borne in mind,<br />
					familiarised by speech,<br />
					pondered over in the mind,<br />
					well penetrated by right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is content with the requisites<br />
					of robe-material,<br />
					almsfood,<br />
					lodgings<br />
					and medicines for the sick.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who acquires at will,<br />
					without trouble,<br />
					without difficulty<br />
					the four meditations<br />
					which are of the purest mentality,<br />
					abidings in ease here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He experiences the various forms of psychic power:</p>

					<p class="f4">having been one<br />

					having been manifold he becomes one;</p>

					<p class="f4">manifest or in- <a id="pg62"><span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span></a> visible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					a rampart<br />
					or a mountain<br />
					as if through air;</p>

					<p class="f4">he plunges into the ground<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water;</p>

					<p class="f4">he walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it<br />
					as if on the ground;</p>

					<p class="f4">sitting cross-legged<br />
					he travels through the air<br />
					like a bird on the wing;</p>

					<p class="f4">with his hand<br />
					he rubs and strokes<br />
					this moon and sun<br />
					although they are of such mighty power and majesty;</p>

					<p class="f4">and even as far as the Brahma-world<br />
					he has power in respect of his person.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified āeva-like hearing<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					he hears both (kinds of) sounds -<br />
					deva-like ones<br />
					and human ones,<br />
					whether they be far or near.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows intuitively by mind<br />
					the minds of other beings,<br />

					that it is full of attachment;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is without attachment<br />
					that it is without attachment;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is full of aversion,<br />

					that it is full of confusion;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is without confusion;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is contracted,<br />
					that it is contracted; <br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is distracted,<br />
					that it is distracted; <br />

					that it has not become great; <br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that has (some other mental state) superior to it,<br />
					that it has (some other mental state) superior to it;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that has no (other mental state) superior to it,<br />
					that it has no (other mental state) superior to it;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is composed,<br />
					that it is composed;,<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is not composed,<br />
					that it is not composed; <br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is freed,<br />
					that it is freed;<br />
					or he comprehends of a mind that is not freed,<br />
					that it is not freed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He recollects a variety of former habitations,<br />
					that is to say</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />

					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so I was nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where I was such a one by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so I was nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he recollects divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified <i>deva</i>-vision<br />

					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />

					and thinks:</p>

					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />

					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified <i>deva</i>-vision<br />

					<p class="f4">These, brahman, are the ten satisfying things<br />
					that have been pointed out by the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whomsoever of us these things exist,<br />
					him do we revere,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					esteem<br />
					and honour<br />
					and on him,<br />
					revering and reverencing him,<br />
					do we live in dependence."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg63"><span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span></a> When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,<br />
					spoke thus to General Upananda;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this?</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is thus, General,<br />
					that these good sirs revere<br />
					what should be revered,<br />
					reverence what should be reverenced,<br />
					esteem what should be esteemed,<br />
					honour what should be honoured,<br />
					then these good sirs most certainly<br />
					revere what should be revered,<br />
					esteem what should be esteemed,<br />
					honour what should be honoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if these good sirs were not to revere,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					esteem<br />
					or honour<br />
					this (monk),<br />
					then who on earth could these good sirs revere,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					esteem<br />
					and honour<br />
					and on whom,<br />
					revering and reverencing him,<br />
					could they live in dependence?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But where is the good Ānanda staying at present?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, brahman, am at present staying in the Bamboo Grove."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, good Ānanda,<br />
					that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant,<br />
					with little sound,<br />
					little noise,<br />
					sheltered from the winds,<br />
					secluded from the haunts of men<br />
					and suitable for solitary meditation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most certainly, brahman,<br />
					the Bamboo Grove is pleasant,<br />
					with little sound,<br />
					little noise,<br />
					sheltered from the winds,<br />
					secluded from the haunts of men,<br />
					suitable for solitary meditation<br />
					as befits a guardian and warden like yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most certainly, good Ānanda,<br />
					the Bamboo Grove is pleasant,<br />
					with little sound,<br />
					little noise,<br />
					sheltered from the winds,<br />
					secluded from the haunts of men,<br />
					suitable for solitary meditation<br />
					as befits meditators<br />
					and those disposed to meditation<br />
					like the revered ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">The revered ones are both meditators<br />
					and disposed to meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time, good Ānanda,<br />
					the revered Gotama was staying near Vesalī<br />
					in the Great Wood<br />
					in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, good Ānanda,<br />
					approached the revered Gotama<br />
					in the Great Wood<br />
					in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the revered Gotama in many a figure<br />
					talked a talk on meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">A meditator was the revered Gotama<br />
					and he was disposed to meditation;<br />
					and the revered Gotama<br />
					praised every (form of) meditation."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, brahman,<br />
					the Lord did not praise every (form of) meditation,<br />
					nor did the Lord not praise<br />
					every (form of) meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of meditation, brahman,<br />
					did the Lord not praise?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, brahman,<br />
					someone dwells with his thought obsessed<br />
					by attachment to pleasures of the senses,<br />
					overcome by attachment to pleasures <a id="pg64"><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></a> of the senses,<br />
					and he does not comprehend<br />
					as it really is<br />
					the escape from the attachment to the pleasures of the senses<br />
					that has arisen;<br />
					he, having made attachment to the pleasures of the senses the main thing,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					meditates on it,<br />
					meditates absorbed,<br />
					meditates more absorbed,<br />
					meditates quite absorbed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with his thought obsessed by ill-will,<br />
					overcome by ill-will,<br />
					and he does not comprehend as it really is<br />
					the escape from ill-will<br />
					that has arisen;<br />
					he, having made ill-will the main thing<br />
					meditates on it,<br />
					meditates absorbed,<br />
					meditates more absorbed,<br />
					meditates quite absorbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with his thought obsessed by sloth and torpor,<br />
					overcome by sloth and torpor,<br />
					and he does not comprehend as it really is<br />
					the escape from sloth and torpor<br />
					that has arisen;<br />
					he, having made sloth and torpor the main thing<br />
					meditates on it,<br />
					meditates absorbed,<br />
					meditates more absorbed,<br />
					meditates quite absorbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with his thought obsessed by restlessness and worry,<br />
					overcome by restlessness and worry,<br />
					and he does not comprehend as it really is<br />
					the escape from restlessness and worry<br />
					that has arisen;<br />
					he, having made restlessness and worry the main thing<br />
					meditates on it,<br />
					meditates absorbed,<br />
					meditates more absorbed,<br />
					meditates quite absorbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with his thought obsessed by doubt,<br />
					overcome by doubt,<br />
					and he does not comprehend as it really is<br />
					the escape from doubt<br />
					that has arisen;<br />
					he, having made doubt the main thing<br />
					meditates on it,<br />
					meditates absorbed,<br />
					meditates more absorbed,<br />
					meditates quite absorbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord does not praise this kind of meditation, brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what kind of meditation, brahman,<br />
					does the Lord praise?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, brahman, a monk,<br />
					aloof from the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering into the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by allaying initial and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and he enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord praises this kind of meditation, brahman."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, good Ānanda,<br />
					the good Gotama contemned the meditation<br />
					that is contemptible,<br />
					commended that which is commendable.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, if you please, good Ānanda,<br />
					we must be going.</p>

					<p class="f4">We are very busy,<br />
					there is much to be done."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You, brahman, do that for which you deem it is now the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vassakāra, the chief minister in Magadha,<br />
					rejoicing in what the venerable Ānanda had said,<br />
					giving thanks,<br />
					rising from his seat departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then soon after the brahman Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief minister in Magadha,<br />
					had departed,<br />
					the brahman Gopaka-Moggallāna spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The good Ānanda has not<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> explained to us what we asked him."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg65"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></a> "Did we not say to you, brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is not even one monk, brahman,<br />
					who is possessed in every way<br />
					and in every part<br />
					of all those things<br />
					of which the Lord was possessed,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, brahman, this Lord<br />
					was one to make arise a Way<br />
					that had not arisen (before),<br />
					to bring about a Way<br />
					not brought about (before),<br />
					to show a Way<br />
					not shown (before);<br />
					he was a knower of the Way,<br />
					an understander of the Way,<br />
					skilled in the Way.</p>
