					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a><br />
					in Ghosita's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time, the monks of Kosambī,<br />
					disputatious,<br />
					quarrelsome,<br />
					contentious,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					lived wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">They neither convinced one another<br />
					nor came to be convinced themselves,<br />
					nor did they win one another over<br />
					or come to be won over themselves.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					that monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Lord, the monks of Kosambī,<br />
					disputatious,<br />
					quarrelsome,<br />
					contentious,<br />
					live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">They neither convinced one another<br />
					nor came to be convinced themselves,<br />
					nor did they win one another over<br />
					or come to be won over themselves."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed a certain monk,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, monk,<br />
					summon these monks in my name,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Teacher is summoning you.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord,"<br />
					and this monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />
					to those monks<br />
					as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as is said, that you, monks,<br />
					are disputatious,<br />
					quarrelsome,<br />
					contentious,<br />
					and live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">That you neither convince one another<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg384"><span class="f2 g"><b>[384]</b></span></a> "Yes, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time when you,<br />
					disputatious,<br />
					quarrelsome,<br />
					contentious,<br />
					live wounding one another<br />

					is a friendly act of body<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> offered<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> your fellow Brahma-farers,<br />
					both in public and in private?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is a friendly act of speech offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br />
					both in public and in private?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is a friendly act of thought offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br />
					both in public and in private?</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then it is to be said, monks,<br />
					that at that time when you,<br />

					at that time no friendly act of body is offered your fellow Brahma-farers,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore, knowing what,<br />

					is it that you,<br />
					foolish men,<br />
					disputatious,<br />

					contentious,<br />
					live wounding one another<br />

					<p class="f4">You neither convince one another<br />
					nor are convinced yourselves,<br />
					neither do you win one another over<br />
					nor are won over yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">So this, foolish men,<br />
					will be for a long time<br />
					for your woe and sorrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk should offer his fellow Brahma-farers<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />
					whatever those lawful acquisitions,<br />
					lawfully acquired,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks,<br />
					whatever view is ariyan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					leading onwards,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the six things to be remembered,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is that view<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now, have I a subjective obsession,<br />

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br />

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br />

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br />

					to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a monk is obsessed<br />

					to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a monk centres his thought<br />

					to this extent is his mind obsessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, a monk centres his thought<br />

					<p class="f4">And what kind of propriety, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is propriety, monks,<br />
