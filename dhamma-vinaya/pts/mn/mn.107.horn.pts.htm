					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi<br />
					in the palace of Migara's mother<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the Eastern Monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Ganaka-Moggallāna approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Ganaka-Moggallāna the brahman<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as, good Gotama,<br />
					in this palace of Migara's mother<br />
					there can be seen a gradual training,<br />
					a gradual doing,<br />
					a gradual practice,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is to say<br />
					as far as the last flight of stairs,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					so, too, good Gotama,<br />
					for these brahmans there can be seen<br />
					a gradual training,<br />
					a gradual doing,<br />
					a gradual practice,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					in the study [of the Vedas];<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					so too, good Gotama,<br />
					for these archers<br />
					there can be seen a gradual training,<br />
					a gradual doing,<br />
					a gradual practice,<br />
					that is to say in archery;<br />
					so too, good Gotama,<br />
					for us whose livelihood is calculation<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there can be seen a gradual training,<br />
					a gradual practice,<br />
					that is to say in accountancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">For when we get a pupil, good Gotama,<br />
					we first of all make him calculate:<br />
					'One one,<br />
					two twos,<br />
					three threes,<br />
					four fours,<br />
					five fives,<br />
					six sixes,<br />
					seven sevens,<br />
					eight eights,<br />
					nine nines,<br />
					ten tens,'<br />
					and we, good Gotama,<br />
					also make him calculate a hundred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it not possible, good Gotama,<br />
					to lay down a similar gradual training,<br />
					gradual doing,<br />
					gradual practice<br />
					in respect of this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is possible, brahman,<br />
					to lay down a gradual training,<br />
					a gradual doing,<br />
					a gradual practice<br />
					in respect of this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahman, even a skilled trainer of horses,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having taken on a beautiful thoroughbred<br />
					first of all gets it used to the training<br />
					in respect of wearing the bit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he gets it used to further training —<br />
					even so brahman,<br />
					the Tathāgata,<br />
					having taken on a man<br />
					<a id="pg53"><span class="f2 g"><b>[53]</b></span></a> to be tamed,<br />
					first of all disciplines him thus:</p>

					<h4>Morality</h4>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk, be of moral habit,<br />
					live controlled by the control of the Obligations,<br />
					endowed with [right] behavior and posture,<br />
					seeing peril in the slightest fault and,<br />
					undertaking them,<br />

					<p class="f4">As soon, brahman,<br />
					as the monk is of moral habit,<br />
					controlled by the control of the Obligations,<br />
					endowed with [right] behavior and posture;<br />
					seeing peril in the slightest fault and,<br />
					undertaking them,<br />
					trains himself in the rules of training,<br />
					the Tathāgata disciplines him further saying:</p>

					<h4>Sense-control</h4>

					<p class="f4">'Come you monk,<br />
					be guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having seen a material shape with the eye,<br />
					do not be entranced with the general appearance,<br />
					do not be entranced with the detail;<br />
					for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil, unskillful states of mind,<br />
					may flow in.</p>

					<p class="f4">So fare along controlling it,<br />
					guard the organ of sight,<br />
					achieve control over the organ of sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear,<br />
					do not be entranced with the general appearance,<br />
					do not be entranced with the detail;<br />
					for if one dwells with the organ of sight uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil, unskillful states of mind,<br />
					may flow in.</p>

					<p class="f4">So fare along controlling it,<br />
					guard the organ of sight,<br />
					achieve control over the organ of sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having smelt a smell with the nose,<br />
					do not be entranced with the general appearance,<br />
					do not be entranced with the detail;<br />
					for if one dwells with the organ of smell uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil, unskillful states of mind,<br />
					may flow in.</p>

					<p class="f4">So fare along controlling it,<br />
					guard the organ of smell,<br />
					achieve control over the organ of smell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having savoured a taste with the tongue,<br />
					do not be entranced with the general appearance,<br />
					do not be entranced with the detail;<br />
					for if one dwells with the organ of taste uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil, unskillful states of mind,<br />
					may flow in.</p>

					<p class="f4">So fare along controlling it,<br />
					guard the organ of taste,<br />
					achieve control over the organ of taste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having felt a touch with the body,<br />
					do not be entranced with the general appearance,<br />
					do not be entranced with the detail;<br />
					for if one dwells with the organ of touch uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil, unskillful states of mind,<br />
					may flow in.</p>

					<p class="f4">So fare along controlling it,<br />
					guard the organ of touch,<br />
					achieve control over the organ of touch.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognized a mental state with the mind,<br />
					do not be entranced with the general appearance,<br />
					do not be entranced with the detail;<br />
					for if one dwells with the organ of mind uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil, unskillful states of mind,<br />
					may flow in.</p>

					<p class="f4">So fare along controlling it,<br />
					guard the organ of mind,<br />
					achieve control over the organ of mind.</p>

					<h4>Moderation in eating</h4>

					<p class="f4">"As soon, brahman,<br />
					as a monk is guarded as to the doors of the sense-organs,<br />
					the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					be moderate in eating;<br />
					you should take food reflecting carefully,<br />
					not for fun<br />
					or indulgence<br />
					or personal charm<br />
					or beautification,<br />
					but taking just enough for maintaining this body<br />
					and keeping it going,<br />
					for keeping it unharmed,<br />
					for furthering the Brahma-faring,<br />
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus will I crush out an old feeling,<br />
					and I will not allow a new feeling to arise,<br />
					and then there will be for me<br />
					subsistence and blamelessness<br />
					and abiding in comfort."'</p>

					<h4>Vigilance</h4>

					<p class="f4">As soon, brahman,<br />
					as a monk is moderate in eating,<br />
					the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					dwell intent on vigilance;<br />
					during the day<br />
					while pacing up and down,<br />
					while sitting down,<br />
					cleanse the mind<br />
					of obstructive mental states;<br />
					during the middle watch of the night,<br />
					lie down on the right side<br />
					in the lion posture,<br />
					<a id="pg54"><span class="f2 g"><b>[54]</b></span></a> foot resting on foot,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					clearly conscious,<br />
					reflecting on the thought of getting up again;<br />
					during the last watch of the night,<br />
					when you have arisen,<br />
					while pacing up and down,<br />
					while sitting down,<br />
					cleanse the mind<br />
					of obstructive mental states.'</p>

					<h4>Mindfulness and clear consciousness</h4>

					<p class="f4">"As soon, brahman,<br />
					as a monk is intent on vigilance,<br />
					the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					be possessed of mindfulness<br />
					and clear consciousness,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are approaching or departing,<br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are looking ahead<br />
					or looking round,<br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are bending in<br />
					or stretching out [the arms],<br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are carrying the outer cloak,<br />
					the bowl<br />
					or robe,<br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are eating,<br />
					drinking,<br />
					munching,<br />
					savouring,<br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are obeying the calls of nature,<br />
					acting with clear consciousness<br />
					whether you are walking,<br />
					standing,<br />
					sitting,<br />
					asleep,<br />
					awake,<br />
					talking<br />
					or being silent.'</p>

					<h4>Overcoming of the five hindrances</h4>

					<p class="f4">"As soon, brahman,<br />
					as he is possessed of mindfulness<br />
					and clear consciousness,<br />
					the Tathāgata disciplines him further,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, monk,<br />
					choose a remote lodging<br />
					in a forest,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at the root of a tree,<br />
					on a mountain slope,<br />
					in a glen,<br />
					a hill cave,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />
					a woodland grove,<br />
					in the open,<br />
					or on a heap of straw.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On returning from alms-gathering<br />
					after the meal,<br />
					the monk sits down cross-legged,<br />
					holding the back erect,<br />
					having made mindfulness rise up in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, getting rid of covetousness for the world,<br />
					dwells with a mind<br />
					devoid of covetousness,<br />
					he cleanses the mind<br />
					of covetousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of the taint of ill-will,<br />
					he dwells benevolent in mind;<br />
					compassionate and merciful<br />
					towards all creatures and beings,<br />
					he cleanses the mind<br />
					of ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of sloth and torpor,<br />
					he dwells without sloth or torpor;<br />
					perceiving the light,<br />
					mindful and clearly conscious<br />
					he cleanses the mind<br />
					of sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of restlessness and worry,<br />
					he dwells calmly;<br />
					the mind inward tranquil,<br />
					he cleanses the mind<br />
					of restlessness and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Getting rid of doubt,<br />
					he dwells doubt-crossed;<br />
					unperplexed as to the states that are skilled,<br />
					he cleanses his mind<br />
					of doubt.</p>

					<h4>Jhana</h4>

					<p class="f4">"He, by getting rid of these five hindrances,<br />
					which are defilements of the mind<br />
					and deleterious to intuitive wisdom,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters and abides in<br />
					the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial <a id="pg55"><span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span></a> thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous<br />
					and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquilized<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					he enters and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous<br />
					and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br />
					he dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy<br />
					of which the ariyans say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Joyful lives he<br />
					who has equanimity<br />
					and is mindful,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down<br />
					of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					he enters and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity<br />
					and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahman, such is my instruction<br />
					for those monks who are learners who,<br />
					perfection being not yet attained,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					dwell longing for<br />
					the incomparable security from the bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as for those monks<br />
					who are perfected ones,<br />
					the cankers destroyed,<br />
					who have lived the life,<br />
					done what was to be done,<br />
					shed the burden,<br />
					attained to their own goal,<br />
					the fetters of becoming<br />
					utterly destroyed,<br />
					and who are freed<br />
					by perfect profound knowledge —<br />
					these things conduce<br />
					both to their abiding in ease here and now<br />
					as well as to their mindfulness<br />
					and clear consciousness."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman Ganaka-Moggallāna spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, on being exhorted thus<br />
					and instructed thus<br />
					by the good Gotama,<br />
					do all the good Gotama's disciples<br />
					attain the unchanging goal<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					nibbana<br />
					or do some not attain it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Some of my disciples, brahman,<br />
					on being exhorted and instructed thus by me,<br />
					attain the unchanging goal —<br />
					nibbana;<br />
					some do not attain it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause, good Gotama,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that; since nibbana does exist,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					since the way leading to nibbana exists,<br />
					since the good Gotama exists as adviser,<br />
					some of the good Gotama's disciples<br />
					on being exhorted thus<br />
					and instructed thus<br />
					by the good Gotama,<br />
					attain the unchanging goal —<br />
					nibbana,<br />
					but some do not attain it?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> "Well then, brahman,<br />
					I will question you on this point<br />
					in reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">As it is pleasing to you,<br />
					so you may answer me.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, brahman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you skilled in the way<br />
					leading to Rājagaha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,<br />
					skilled am I<br />
					in the way leading to Rājagaha."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this?</p>

					<p class="f4">A man might come along here<br />
					wanting to go to Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached you,<br />
					he might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I want to go to Rājagaha, sir;<br />
					show me the way to this Rājagaha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">You might speak thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, my good man,<br />
					this road goes to Rājagaha;<br />
					go along it for a while.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have gone along it for a while<br />
					you will see a village;<br />
					go along for a while;<br />
					when you have gone along for a while<br />
					you will see a market town;<br />
					go for a while.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have gone along for a while<br />
					you will see Rājagaha<br />
					with its delightful parks,<br />
					delightful forests,<br />
					delightful fields,<br />
					delightful ponds.</p>

					<p class="f4">But although he has been exhorted<br />
					and instructed thus by you,<br />
					he might take the wrong road<br />
					and go westwards.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second man might come along<br />
					wanting to go to Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached you,<br />
					he might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I want to go to Rājagaha, sir;<br />
					show me the way to this Rājagaha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">You might speak thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, my good man,<br />
					this road goes to Rājagaha;<br />
					go along it for a while.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have gone along it for a while<br />
					you will see a village;<br />
					go along for a while;<br />
					when you have gone along for a while<br />
					you will see a market town;<br />
					go for a while.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have gone along for a while<br />
					you will see Rājagaha<br />
					with its delightful parks,<br />
					delightful forests,<br />
					delightful fields,<br />
					delightful ponds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Exhorted and instructed thus by you<br />
					he might get to Rājagaha safely.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause, brahman,<br />
					what the reason that,<br />
					since Rājagaha does exist,<br />
					since the way leading to Rājagaha exists,<br />
					since you exist as adviser,<br />
					the one man,<br />
					although being exhorted<br />
					and instructed thus by you,<br />
					may take the wrong road<br />
					and go westwards<br />
					while the other may get to Rājagaha safely?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What can I, good Gotama, do<br />
					in this matter?</p>

					<p class="f4">A shower of the way, good Gotama, am I."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, brahman,<br />
					nibbana does exist,<br />
					the way leading to nibbana exists<br />
					and I exist as adviser.</p>

					<p class="f4">But some of my disciples,<br />
					on being exhorted<br />
					and instructed thus by me<br />
					attain the unchanging goal —<br />
					nibbana,<br />
					some do not attain it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What can I, brahman, do<br />
					in this matter?</p>

					<p class="f4">A shower of the way, brahman,<br />
					is a Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman Ganaka-Moggallāna spoke thus<br />
					to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, as for those persons<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who, in want of a way of living,<br />

					who are crafty,<br />

					<p class="f4">But as for those young men of respectable families<br />

					one might set upright<br />
