					<p class="f4">The Lord saw these many <span class="f3"><b>[110]</b></span> lodgings prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan,<br />

					having approached, he sat down on a seat that was ready.<br />
					While he was sitting down the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Many lodgings, Ānanda, are prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan.<br />

					wherein is delight, wherein is content,<br />
					but that from its changing and becoming otherwise<br />
					there will not arise grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this abiding, Ānanda,<br />
					has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					by not attending to any signs,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the entering on and abiding<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> in an inward (concept of) emptiness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And if, Ānanda, while the Tathāgata is abiding in this abiding<br />
					there are monks, nuns,<br />
					men and women lay followers,<br />
					kings and kings' ministers,<br />
					leaders and disciples of other sects<br />
					who approach him,<br />
					then, Ānanda, the Tathāgata<br />
					with his whole mind tending to aloofness,<br />

					inclining to aloofness,<br />
					remote,<br />
					delighting in renunciation,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, if a monk should desire:<br />
					'Entering on <a id="pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> an inward (concept of) emptiness,<br />
					may I dwell therein,'<br />
					that monk, Ānanda,<br />
					should steady, calm, make one-pointed and concentrate<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> his mind<br />
					precisely on what is inward.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda, does a monk<br />
					steady, calm, make one-pointed and concentrate his mind<br />
					precisely on what is inward?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering on it abides in the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters and abides in the second meditation,<br />
					which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and he experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the Ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful.'<br />
					and he enters and abides in the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters and abides in the fourth meditation,<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Ānanda, does a monk steady,<br />
					calm,<br />
					make one-pointed<br />
					and concentrate his mind<br />
					precisely on what is inward.</p>

And it proceeds: When the Lord had arisen after lying down after a meal ... he attained the attainment of the fruit(s). At that time the company assembled to hear <i>dhamma.</i> The Lord ... taught <i>dhamma,</i> and without letting pass the right time (to hear it), he <i>vivekaninnena cittena parisaɱ uyyojeti</i>. This could mean either: with his mind tending to aloofness he dismissed the company; or: with his mind tending to aloofness he inspired the company. E.M. Hare at G.S. iv 158 renders the phrase as: "entirely confines his talk to the subject of going apart." It is possible that <i>uyyojeti</i> should be understood in both its meanings: that the Lord incited the company to seek aloofness for themselves and also dismissed them in order that they might do so. If we were to take <i>uyyojeti</i> only as "to dismiss," this would imply a certain selfishness on the Lord's part, and the <i>AA.</i> (iv 122) is apparently against this: <i>teasɱ upaṭṭhānagamanakaɱ yevā ti attho</i>, the meaning is going to their service (<i>i.e.</i> helping them).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Sometimes to the one and sometimes to the other, <i>MA</i> iv 161. <i>Cf.</i> the internal and external contemplation of the body at <i>M.</i>i 56 (<i>M.L.S.</i> i. 72 and see there <i>n.</i> 4)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>ānañja</i>. <i>Cf. M.</i> ii 229, <i>Vin.</i> iii 4. "Thinking, I will become freed both ways," he attends to the attainment of immateriality and imperturbability, <i>āñaja-arūpasamāpatti</i>, <i>MA</i> iv 161, <i>VinA.</i> 157 glosses by <i>acala</i>, unshaking, steady.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> The text reads <i>parimasmiɱ</i>. <i>P.E.D.</i> and Geiger, <i>Pali Lit. u. Sprache</i> §19, say that <i>parima</i> is equivalent to <i>parama</i>. But <i>MA.</i> iv 161 reads <i>purimasmiɱ</i>, and I follow this. I think the meaning is that the monk should make another attempt to enter and abide in the inward concept of emptiness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> An abiding in calm and insight, <i>MA.</i> iv 162</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> That is, to this <i>kammaṭṭhāna</i>, or exercise in meditation, <i>MA.</i> iv. 162</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Here reading <i>sūrakathā</i>. See notes on these kinds of talk at <i>B.D.</i> iii. 82</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> As at <i>Ud.</i> 36, <sup>A.</sup> iii 117, iv. 352, v. 67; quoted at <i>MA.</i> i. 97</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>vitakka.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>niyyanti (niyyāti) takkarassa sammādukkhakkhayāya</i> is stock, <i>e.g.</i> at <i>MA.</i> i. 68, 81, 322. It is suggested that in the above passage <i>kara</i>, normally "doing" (<i>i.e.,</i> in <i>takkarassa</i>, of one doing thus), would be better rendered as "thinker."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> i. 85, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> <i>me</i> is not in the text at the corresponding passage above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>kusalāyatakā</i>; <i>MA.</i> iv 163 says <i>kusalato āgatā</i>, derived from what is skilled; but the sense of the exegesis and of the <i>v.ll.</i> seems to be 'leading on (step by step) to what is skilled."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The reading above, and again below, is <i>payujjamāno</i>, passive present participle of <i>payuñjati</i>, to harness, yoke, employ. I have taken it however as <i>panujjamāno</i> as at <i>M.</i> i. 108.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. M.</i> i. 310</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Of the nine divisions into which the Teaching was classified only the first two are mentioned here, <i>sutta</i> and <i>geyya</i>. The word <i>veyyākaraṇa</i>, "exposition," which also occurs in the above passage, is not being used there with the special sense of the third division of the Teaching, "the Expositions," but in a general and untechnical sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> i. 213</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> <i>evaɱ sante</i>. While some disciples are living alone, the matter (connected with the ten topics of talk) does not prosper; therefore, to show the peril, <i>ādīnava</i>, besetting solitude, he said <i>evaɱ sante</i>, which means: being in solitude thus, <i>evaɱ ekībhāve sante</i>, <i>MA.</i> iv 164-165</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> MA iv 165, an outside teacher who is a ford-maker, <i>i.e.,</i> the leader of an "heretical" sect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Text reads <i>mucchati kāmayati</i>; but Siam. Version and <i>MA.</i> iv 165 read <i>mucchaɱ nikāmayati</i>. The latter explains: <i>mucchanataṇhaɱ pattheti pavatteti</i>, which seems to mean: he longs for and sets going the craving for infatuation, i.e. for falling in love, a meaning which <i>kāmeti (kāmayati)</i> bears at <i>e.g. M.</i> ii 40.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. M.</i> i. 280</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> <i>anubrūhayamāno.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> <i>vivekam anuyutto brūhayamāno</i>. <i>Cf. M.</i> Sta. 6, "the cultivator of empty places."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> Those who have gone forth in this Dispensation, <i>sāsana</i>, should be able to attain the four ways, the four fruits and Nibbāna but, failing of the instructions, <i>sāsana</i>, they fail of these nine strands of the supermundane.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. S.</i> ii 128</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> The <i>na</i> of the text should be omitted as it is in some MSS.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> The <i>ca</i> should read <i>na ca</i> as in one MS. version.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> <i>āmake āmakamatte. MA.</i> iv 166 says <i>āmake</i> is <i>apakkhe</i>, and <i>āmakamatte ti āmake nātisukkhe bhājane</i>, "an unbaked vessel, not quite dry." "The potter gently takes these vessels in both hands, saying: 'Do not break'; but I will not proceed with you as the potter proceeds." I do not see the full force of this simile; therefore my translation must remain very tentative. But I believe it means that whereas the potter gives, and can give, his vessels one chance only, the Teacher is undefeated by any initial failure there may be, and proceeds undeterred with the expectation of final success on the part of his pupil.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> <i>niggayha niggayha MA</i> iv 166 says, "having exhorted once, I will not be silent; constantly reproving (<i>niggahetvā niggahetvā</i>) again and again I will exhort, I will instruct." <i>Cf.</i> <i>niggayhavādin</i> at <i>Dhp.</i> 76; and see <i>DhA.</i> ii 108 which quotes the above passage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> <i>pavayha pavayha</i> as at <i>M.</i> i. 442, 443. From <i>pavāhati,</i> to cause to be carried away, to remove (stains), hence to cleanse: of faults or taints, <i>dosa,</i> as at <i>MA.</i> iv 166 which also says: as a potter, having removed, <i>pavāhetvā (v.l. pajahitvā)</i> the cracked and broken vessels (reading with Siam. Edn. <i>bhinnachinnabhājanāni</i>) from among those that have been baked, takes the well baked ones, tapping (<i>i.e.</i> testing) them again and again. So too I, having repeatedly removed (stains from you), will again and again exhort and instruct (you).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> <i>yo sāro so ṭhassati:</i> "While you are being exhorted thus by me that which is the pith of the ways and the fruits will persist," <i>MA.</i> iv 167. <i>Sāra</i> is the heartwood, pith, core. It is no doubt meant that this will persist and endure (like well baked vessels) when all the mistakes and errors that dog a learner's path have been cleared away and removed (like the cracked and broken vessels from among those that have been well baked).</p>
