					<p class="f4">The Lord saw these many <span class="f3"><b>[110]</b></span> lodgings prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan,<br />

					having approached, he sat down on a seat that was ready.<br />
					While he was sitting down the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Many lodgings, Ānanda, are prepared in the dwelling-place of Kāḷakhemaka the Sakyan.<br />

					wherein is delight, wherein is content,<br />
					but that from its changing and becoming otherwise<br />
					there will not arise grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this abiding, Ānanda,<br />
					has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					by not attending to any signs,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the entering on and abiding<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> in an inward (concept of) emptiness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And if, Ānanda, while the Tathāgata is abiding in this abiding<br />
					there are monks, nuns,<br />
					men and women lay followers,<br />
					kings and kings' ministers,<br />
					leaders and disciples of other sects<br />
					who approach him,<br />
					then, Ānanda, the Tathāgata<br />
					with his whole mind tending to aloofness,<br />

					inclining to aloofness,<br />
					remote,<br />
					delighting in renunciation,<br />
					bringing to an end all the things on which the cankers are founded,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, if a monk should desire:<br />
					'Entering on <a id="pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> an inward (concept of) emptiness,<br />
					may I dwell therein,'<br />
					that monk, Ānanda,<br />
					should steady, calm, make one-pointed and concentrate<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> his mind<br />
					precisely on what is inward.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda, does a monk<br />
					steady, calm, make one-pointed and concentrate his mind<br />
					precisely on what is inward?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering on it abides in the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters and abides in the second meditation,<br />
					which is devoid of initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and he experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the Ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful.'<br />
					and he enters and abides in the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Ānanda, a monk,<br />
					by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters and abides in the fourth meditation,<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Ānanda, does a monk steady,<br />
					calm,<br />
					make one-pointed<br />
					and concentrate his mind<br />
					precisely on what is inward.</p>

And it proceeds: When the Lord had arisen after lying down after a meal ... he attained the attainment of the fruit(s). At that time the company assembled to hear <i>Dhamma.</i> The Lord ... taught <i>Dhamma,</i> and without letting pass the right time (to hear it), he <i>vivekaninnena cittena parisaṃ uyyojeti</i>. This could mean either: with his mind tending to aloofness he dismissed the company; or: with his mind tending to aloofness he inspired the company. E.M. Hare at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.030.hare.pts.htm#pg158"><i>G.S.</i> iv 158</a> renders the phrase as: "entirely confines his talk to the subject of going apart." It is possible that <i>uyyojeti</i> should be understood in both its meanings: that the Lord incited the company to seek aloofness for themselves and also dismissed them in order that they might do so. If we were to take <i>uyyojeti</i> only as "to dismiss," this would imply a certain selfishness on the Lord's part, and the <i>AA.</i> (iv 122) is apparently against this: <i>teasṃ upaṭṭhānagamanakaṃ yevā ti attho,</i> the meaning is going to their service (<i>i.e.</i> helping them).</p>
