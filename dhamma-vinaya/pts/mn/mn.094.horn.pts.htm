					<p class="f4">At one time the venerable Udena was staying near Benares in the Khemiya Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the brahman Ghotamukha had arrived at Benares<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then while the brahman Ghoṭamukha was pacing up and down<br />
					and roaming about on foot<br />
					he approached the Khemiya Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the venerable Udena was pacing up and down<br />
					in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Ghoṭamukha approached the venerable Udena;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Udena,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he spoke thus,<br />
					while still pacing up and down,<br />
					to the venerable Udena<br />
					while he was still pacing up and down:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"My good recluse,<br />
					there is no going forth under <i>dhamma</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or so it seems to me;<br />
					but then<br />
					is this through not seeing revered men like yourself,<br />
					or that which,<br />
					in this matter,<br />
					is <i>dhamma</i>?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Udena came down<br />
					from the place for pacing up and down,<br />
					entered a dwelling-place<br />
					and sat down on an appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the brahman Ghoṭamukha<br />
					also coming down from the place for pacing up and down<br />
					and entering the dwelling-place<br />
					stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Udena spoke thus to the brahman Ghoṭamukha<br />
					as he was standing at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, there are seats;<br />
					do sit down if you like."</p>

					<p class="f4">"While waiting for the good Udena<br />
					we do not sit down.</p>

					<p class="f4">For how could one like me<br />
					presume to sit down on a seat<br />
					before being invited?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Ghoṭamukha,<br />
					having taken a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the brahman Ghoṭamukha spoke thus to the venerable Udena:</p>

					<p class="f4">"My good recluse,<br />
					there is no going forth under <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					or so it seems to me;<br />
					but then,<br />
					is this through not seeing revered men like yourself,<br />
					or that which,<br />
					in this matter,<br />
					is <i>dhamma</i>?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg351"><span class="f2 g"><b>[351]</b></span></a> "But if you, brahman,<br />
					could allow what is approved by me,<br />
					and could reject what should be rejected,<br />
					and should you not know<br />
					the meaning of what is said by me<br />
					were to question me further about it,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is this, good Udena,<br />
					what is the meaning of that?' -<br />
					having arranged it like this<br />
					we might have some conversation."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will allow what is approved by the good Udena,<br />
					and I will reject what should be rejected,<br />
					and if I do not know the meaning<br />
					of what is said by the good Udena<br />
					I will question the honoured Udena further about it,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is this, good Udena,<br />
					what is the meaning of that?' -<br />
					having arranged it like this<br />
					let there be some conversation between us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, these four kinds of persons are found in the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, brahman, some person is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment;</p>

					<p class="f4">as to this, brahman, some person is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others;</p>

					<p class="f4">as to this, brahman, some person is both a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting self,<br />
					and a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others;</p>

					<p class="f4">as to this, brahman, some person is neither a self-tormentor,<br />
					not intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					not intent on the practice of tormenting others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these four persons, brahman,<br />
					which appeals to your mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir, that person who is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment -<br />
					that person does not appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir, that person who is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others -<br />
					neither does that person appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir, that person who is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					and who is also a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others -<br />
					neither does that person appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, good Udena, whatever person<br />
					is neither a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					nor a tormentor or others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					he, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not mortify<br />
					or torment<br />
					either himself or others -<br />
					(all of them)<br />
					yearning for happiness<br />
					and recoiling from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore this person appeals to my mind."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, there are these two companies.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Which two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, brahman, some company,<br />
					inflamed with a passion<br />
					for gems and jewelry,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					looks about for a wife and children,<br />
					men and women slaves,<br />
					fields and sites,<br />
					gold and silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">But here, brahman, some company,<br />
					not inflamed with a passion<br />
					for gems and jewelry,<br />
					getting rid of wife and children,<br />
					men and women slaves,<br />
					fields and sites,<br />
					gold and silver,<br />
					goes forth from home into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This person, brahman,<br />
					neither torments himself<br />
					nor is intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					he is not a tormentor of others<br />
					nor intent on the practice of tormenting others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become.</p>

					<p class="f4">In which company do you, brahman,<br />
					mostly see that man -<br />
					in that company<br />
					that is inflamed with a passion<br />
					for gems and jewelry<br />
					and looks about for a wife and children,<br />
					men and women slaves,<br />
					fields and sites,<br />
					gold and silver;<br />
					or in that company<br />
					that is not inflamed with a passion<br />
					for gems and <a id="pg352"><span class="f2 g"><b>[352]</b></span></a> jewelry and that,<br />
					getting rid of wife and children,<br />
					men and women slaves,<br />
					fields and sites,<br />
					gold and silver,<br />
					goes forth from home into homelessness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This man, good Udena,<br />
					who is neither a tormentor of self<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting self,<br />
					who is not a tormentor of others<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					and who, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become -<br />
					I mostly see that man<br />
					in that company that is not inflamed with a passion<br />
					for gems and jewelry<br />
					and that, getting rid of wife and children,<br />
					men and women slaves,<br />
					fields and sites,<br />
					gold and silver,<br />
					goes forth from home into homelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But this was said by you just now, brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We understand thus, good recluse,<br />
					there is no going forth under <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					or so it seems to me;<br />
					but then,<br />
					is this through not seeing revered men like yourself,<br />
					or that which,<br />
					in this matter,<br />
					is <i>dhamma</i>?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Udena, these words spoken to me<br />
					are certainly helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a going forth under <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					or so it (now) seems to me,<br />
					and so may the good Udena understand me.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But it would be good<br />
					if, out of compassion,<br />
					the good Udena would explain to me in full<br />
					these four kinds of persons<br />
					that he has spoken of in brief<br />
					but not explained in full."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, brahman, listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"<br />
					the brahman Ghoṭamukha answered the venerable Udena in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Udena spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which, brahman,<br />
					is the person who torments self<br />
					and is intent on the practice of self-torment?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, brahman, some person is unclothed, flouting life's decencies,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					licking his hands (after meals),<br />
					not one to come when asked to do so,<br />
					not one to stand still when asked to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not consent (to accept food) offered to (me)<br />
					or specially prepared for (him)<br />
					nor to (accept) an invitation (to a meal).</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not accept<br />
					(food) straight from a cooking pot or pan,<br />
					nor within the threshould,<br />
					nor among the faggots,<br />
					nor among the rice-pounders,<br />
					nor when two people were eating,<br />
					nor from a pregnant woman,<br />
					nor from one giving suck,<br />
					nor from one co-habiting with a man,<br />
					nor from gleanings,<br />
					nor near where a dog is standing,<br />
					nor where flies are swarming,<br />
					nor fish,<br />
					nor meat.</p>

					<p class="f4">He drinks neither fermented liquor<br />
					nor spirits<br />
					nor rice-gruel.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a one-house-man,<br />
					a one-piece-man,<br />
					or a two-house-man,<br />
					a two-piece-man<br />
					or a three-house-man,<br />
					a three-piece-man<br />
					or a four-house-man,<br />
					a four-piece-man<br />
					or a five-house-man,<br />
					a five-piece-man<br />
					or a six-house-man,<br />
					a six-piece-man<br />
					or a seven-house-man,<br />
					a seven-piece-man.</p>

					<p class="f4">He subsists on one little offering,<br />
					and he subsists on two little offerings<br />
					and he subsists on three little offerings<br />
					and he subsists on four little offerings<br />
					and he subsists on five little offerings<br />
					and he subsists on six little offerings<br />
					and he subsists on seven little offerings.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes food only once a day,<br />
					and once in two days<br />
					and once in three days<br />
					and once in four days<br />
					and once in five days<br />
					and once in six days<br />
					and once in seven days.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives intent on the practice<br />
					of eating rice at regular fort-nightly intervals.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to be one feeding on potherbs<br />
					or feeding on millet<br />
					or on wild rice<br />
					or on snippets of skin<br />
					or on water-plants<br />
					or on the red powder of rice husks<br />
					or on the discarded scum of rice on the boil<br />
					or on the flour of oil-seeds<br />
					or grass<br />
					or cowdung.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who subsisted<br />
					on forest roots and fruits,<br />
					eating the fruits that had fallen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wares coarse hempen cloths,<br />
					and he wares mixed cloths,<br />
					and he wares cerements,<br />
					and he wares rags taken from the dust heap,<br />
					and he wares tree-bark fibre,<br />
					and he wares antelope skins,<br />
					and he wares strips of antelope skin,<br />
					and he wares cloths of kusa-grass,<br />
					and he wares cloths of bark,<br />
					and he wares cloths of wood shavings,<br />
					and he wares a blanket of human hair,<br />
					and he wares a blanket of animal hair,<br />
					and he wares owls' feathers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who plucks out<br />
					the hair of his head and beard,<br />
					intent on the practice of plucking out<br />
					the hair of head and beard.</p>

					<p class="f4">He becomes one who stands upright,<br />
					refusing a seat;<br />
					He becomes one who squats on his haunches,<br />
					intent on the practice of squatting.</p>

					<p class="f4">He becomes one for covered thorns,<br />
					making his bed on covered thorns;<br />
					and he is intent on the practice<br />
					of going down to the water to bathe<br />
					up to three times in an evening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in many a way<br />
					does he live intent on the practice<br />
					of mortifying and tormenting his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahman, this is called<br />
					the person who is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And which, brahman,<br />
					is the person who is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahman,<br />
					some person is a cattle-butcher,<br />
					or a pig-killer,<br />
					fowler,<br />
					deer-stalker,<br />
					hunter,<br />
					fisherman,<br />
					thief,<br />
					executioner,<br />
					jailer,<br />
					or (one of) those others<br />
					who follow a bloody calling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the person, brahman,<br />
					who is called a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And which, brahman,<br />
					is the person who is both a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting self,<br />
					and also a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahman,<br />
					some person is a noble anointed king<br />
					or a very rich brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having had a new conference hall built<br />
					to the east of the town,<br />
					having had his head and beard shaved,<br />
					having put on a shaggy skin,<br />
					having smeared his body with ghee and oil,<br />
					scratching his back with a deer-horn,<br />
					enters the conference hall<br />
					together with his chief consort<br />
					and a brahman priest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he lies down to sleep<br />
					on the bare grassy ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">The king lives on the milk from one udder<br />
					of a cow that has a calf of like colour,<br />
					his chief consort lives on the milk from the second udder,<br />
					the brahman priest lives on the milk from the third udder,<br />
					the milk from the fourth udder<br />
					they offer to the fire;<br />
					the calf lives on what is over.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let so many bulls be slain for the sacrifice,<br />
					let so many steers be slain for the sacrifice,<br />
					let so many heifers be slain for the sacrifice,<br />
					let so many goats be slain for the sacrifice,<br />
					let so many rams be slain for the sacrifice,<br />
					let so many trees be felled<br />
					for the sacrificial posts,<br />
					let so much <i>kusa</i>-grass be reaped<br />
					for the sacrificial spot.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who are called his slaves<br />
					or messengers<br />
					or workpeople,<br />
					they, scared of the stick,<br />
					scared of danger,<br />
					with tearful faces and crying,<br />
					set about their preparations.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, is called<br />
					the person who is both a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					and a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And which, brahman, is the person<br />
					who is neither a self-tormentor,<br />
					not intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					not intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					and who, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, brahman, a <i>Tathāgata</i> arises in the world,<br />
					a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened one<br />
					endowed with right knowledge and conduct,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world<br />
					with the devas,<br />
					with Māra,<br />
					with Brahmā,<br />
					creation<br />
					with its recluses and brahmans,<br />
					its devas and men,<br />
					having realised them by his own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>dhamma</i> which is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the ending,<br />
					with the spirit and the letter;<br />
					he proclaims the Brahma-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					quite purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder<br />
					or a householder's son<br />
					or one born in another family<br />
					hears that <i>dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard that <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					he gains faith in the <i>Tathāgata</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with this faith<br />
					that he has acquired,<br />
					he reflects in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The household life is confined and dusty;<br />
					going forth is of the open;<br />
					it is not easy for one who lives in a house<br />
					to fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					wholly pure,<br />
					polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having put on saffron robes,<br />
					should go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness?'</p>

					<p class="f4">After a time,<br />
					getting rid of his wealth,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					getting rid of his circle of relations,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					having cut off his hair and beard,<br />
					having put on saffron robes,<br />
					he goes forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being thus one who has gone forth<br />
					and who is endowed with the training<br />
					and the way of living of monks,<br />
					abandoning onslaught on creatures,<br />
					is one who abstains from onslaught on creatures;<br />
					the stick laid aside,<br />
					the knife laid aside,<br />
					he lives kindly,<br />
					scrupulous,<br />
					friendly<br />
					and compassionate<br />
					towards all breathing things and creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the taking of what is not given,<br />
					he is one who abstains from taking what is not given;<br />
					being one who takes (only) what is given,<br />
					who waits for what is given,<br />
					not by stealing he lives with a self become pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning unchastity,<br />
					he is one who is chaste,<br />
					keeping remote (from unchastity),<br />
					abstaining from dealings with women.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning lying speech,<br />
					he is one who abstains from lying speech,<br />
					a truth-speaker,<br />
					a bondsman to truth,<br />
					trustworthy,<br />
					dependable,<br />
					no deceiver of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech,<br />
					he is one who abstains from slanderous speech;<br />
					having heard something here<br />
					he is not one for repeating it elsewhere<br />
					for (causing) variance among these (people),<br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he is not one to repeat it there<br />
					for (causing) variance among these (people).</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way<br />
					he is a reconciler of those who are at variance,<br />
					and one who combines those who are friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concord is his pleasure,<br />
					concord his delight,<br />
					concord his joy,<br />
					concord is the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning harsh speech,<br />
					he is one who abstains from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahman, a monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">With the purified <i>deva</i>-vision<br />
