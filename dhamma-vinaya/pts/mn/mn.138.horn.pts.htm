					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will teach you, monks, an exposition and (its) analysis.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed.1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Listen to it,<br />
					attend carefully,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg272"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span></a> "Monks, a monk should so investigate<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> (things) that,<br />
					as he investigates,<br />
					his consciousness of what is external<br />
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br />
					and of what is internal<br />
					be unslackened<br />
					so that it<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> may not be disturbed by grasping;<br />

					then, for him who is (thus) undisturbed by grasping<br />
					there is in the future<br />
					no origin or rise<br />
					of birth, old age and dying<br />
					or of anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had said this,<br />
					the Well-farer rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Lord had gone, it occurred to these monks:<br />
					"Your reverences, the Lord, recited this exposition to us in brief:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that,<br />
					as he investigates,<br />
					his consciousness of what is external<br />
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br />

					monks, if consciousness of what is external<br />

					there is in the future<br />
					no origin or rise<br />
					of birth, old age and dying<br />
					or of anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">But without having explained the meaning in full<br />
					he rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, who can explain the meaning in full<br />
					of this exposition which was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which he did not explain in full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to these monks:<br />
					"Now, the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />
					is both praised by the Teacher<br />
					and revered by intelligent Brahma-farers;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> <br />
					<span class="f3 g"><i>[224, 225]</i></span> and the venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full<br />
					the meaning of this exposition<br />
					that was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which was not explained in full.<br />
					Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					were to question him on this meaning?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they exchanged greetings with him,<br />
					and when they had conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.<br />
					As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend Kaccāna, the Lord,<br />
					having recited this exposition to us in brief<br />
					but not having explained its meaning in full,<br />
					rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that,<br />
					as he investigates,<br />
					his consciousness of what is external<br />

					there is in the future<br />
					no origin or rise<br />
					of birth, old age and dying<br />
					or of anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Lord had departed,<br />
					it occurred to us, reverend Kaccāna:<br />
					'Your reverences, the Lord, having recited this exposition to us in brief,<br />
					but not having explained the meaning in full,<br />
					rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that,<br />

					or of anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, who can explain the meaning in full<br />
					of this exposition that was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which he did not explaining full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, reverend Kaccāna, it occurred to us:<br />
					'Now the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />
					is both praised by the Teacher<br />
					and revered by intelligent fellow-Brahma-farers;<br />
					and the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />
					is able to explain in full<br />
					the meaning of this exposition<br />
					that was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which was not explained in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Supose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					were to question him on this meaning?</p>

					<p class="f4">May the venerable Kaccāna the Great explain it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, as a man walking about aiming at the pith,<br />
					searching for the pith,<br />
					looking about for the pith<br />
					of a great, stable and pithy tree,<br />
					might pass by the root,<br />
					pass by the trunk,<br />
					thinking that the pith was to be looked for<br />
					in the branches and foliage<br />
					— even so is this performance of the venerable ones,<br />
					for (although) you had the Teacher face-to-face,<br />
					yet you have ignored that Lord<br />
					and judge that it is I who should be questioned on this meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, your reverences,<br />
					the Lord knows what should be known,<br />
					sees what should be seen,<br />
					he has become vision,<br />
					become knowledge,<br />
					become <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					become Brahma,<br />
					he is the propounder,<br />
					the expounder,<br />
					the bringer of the goal,<br />
					the giver of the Deathless,<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i>-lord,<br />
					Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the time<br />
					when you should have questioned the Lord on this meaning<br />
					so that you might have understood what the Lord explained to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly, reverend Kaccāna,<br />
					the Lord knows what should be known,<br />
					sees what should be seen,<br />
					he has become vision,<br />
					become knowledge,<br />
					become <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					become Brahma,<br />
					he is the propounder,<br />
					the expounder,<br />
					the bringer of the goal,<br />
					the giver of the Deathless,<br />
					<i>Dhamma</i>-lord,<br />
					Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the time<br />
					when we should have questioned the Lord on this meaning<br />
					so that we might have understood what the Lord explained to us.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />
					is both praised by the Teacher<br />
					and revered by intelligent fellow Brahma-farers;<br />
					and the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />
					is able to explain in full<br />
					the meaning of this exposition<br />
					that was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which was not explained in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the venerable Kaccāna explain it without finding it troublesome."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, your reverences,<br />
					listen,<br />
					pay careful attention<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					these monks answered the venerable Kaccāna the Great in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Kaccāna the Great spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In regard to that exposition, your reverences,<br />
					which was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which he had not explained in full<br />
					when he rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place:</p>

					<p class="f4">— of this exposition which was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which he did not explain in full,<br />
					I, your reverences, understand the meaning in full thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br />
					is called distracted, diffused consciousness<br />

					<p class="f4">If, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">If, having heard a sound with the ear,<br />

					<p class="f4">If, having felt a touch with the body,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is thus, your reverences,<br />
					that consciousness of what is external<br />
					is called distracted and diffused.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, your reverences,<br />
					is called undistracted, undiffused consciousness<br />

					<p class="f4">If, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk should so investigate (things) that,<br />
					as he investigates,<br />
					his consciousness of what is external<br />
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br />
					and of what is internal<br />
					be unslackened<br />

					monks, if consciousness of what is external<br />
					be undistracted, not diffused,<br />
					of what is internal<br />
					be unslackened,<br />

					there is in the future<br />

					<p class="f4">— Of this exposition which was recited by the Lord in brief<br />

					I, your reverences understand the meaning in full thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, venerable ones, so desire,<br />
					you can approach the Lord<br />
					and question him as to the meaning<br />
					so that as the Lord explains it to you<br />
					so may you understand it."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then we,<br />
					delighting and rejoicing in what the venerable Kaccāna the Great had said,<br />
					rising from our seats,<br />
					approached the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Learned, monks, is Kaccāna the Great,<br />
					of great wisdom, monks, is Kaccana the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if you, monks, bad questioned me as to this meaning,<br />
					I too would have explained it precisely as it was explained by Kaccāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, this is the exact meaning of that,<br />
					and thus should you remember it."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">Ed.1</a>]</sup> What the Buddha actually does here is to teach the exposition, Mahā Kaccāna teaches the analysis. But according to the rules, when the Buddha acknowledges what another person says, that becomes the word of the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 28 says <i>uddesañ ca vibhaṇgañ ca mātikañ ca vibhajanañ cā ti.</i> So <i>uddesa</i> is the statement of the headings (<i>mātikā</i>) which will be analysed in this Discourse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>upaparikkheyya.</i> should weigh, measure, explore, mark out. <i>MA.</i> v. 28. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/iti/iti.pali.bd.htm#pg94"><i>Iti.,</i> p. 94.</a> where this "heading" also occurs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Consciousness, <i>MA.</i> v. 28.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> As at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg194"><i>M.</i> iii. 194-195.</a> [re-inserted by ed.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Text here reads <i>upekhānsārī;</i> but I think it necessary to insert <b>sukha</b> into this compound as in the negative clause below: <i>upekhā-sukh-ā-nsārī.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> For the rest of Maha-Kaccāna's explanation, <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p7"><i>S.</i> iii. 15 <i>ff.</i></a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> In Chalmers' text a sentence is here inserted, presumably in error as it has no counterpart in the repetitions below or in the <i>S.</i> version: <i>tassa rūpam vipariṇāmānuparivatti viññāṇaṃ hoti</i> should therefore be deleted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>upekhavā</i> of Chalmers' text should probably read, with <i>S</i>. <i>apekhavā.</i> <i>MA.</i> v. 3O, reading <i>apekkhavā,</i> explains by <i>sā1ayo sapiho,</i> with pleasure and affection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>'anupādāya.</i> The reading at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.007.pali.bd.htm#pg16"><i>S.</i> iii. 16,</a> which I follow, is <i>upādāya.</i></p>
