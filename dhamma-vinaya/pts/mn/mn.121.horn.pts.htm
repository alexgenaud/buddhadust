					who in the distant past,<br />
					entering on the utterly purified and incomparably highest (concept of) emptiness,<br />
					abided therein<br />
					— all these, entering on precisely this utterly purified and incomparably highest (concept of) emptiness, abided therein.<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda, thinking:<br />
					'Entering on the utterly purified and incomparably highest (concept of) emptiness, I will abide therein'<br />
