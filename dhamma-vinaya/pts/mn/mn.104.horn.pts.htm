					<p class="f4">At that time Nātaputta the Jain had <a id="pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> recently died at Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">On his death the Jains broke up;<br />
					splitting into two,<br />
					striving, quarrelling, disputing,<br />
					they lived wounding one another with the weapons of the tongue, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> do not understand this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline,<br />

					<p class="f4">How can you understand this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline?</p>

					<p class="f4">You are one who fares wrongly,<br />
					I am one who fares aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is sense in what I say,<br />
					no sense in what you say;<br />
					you say at the end what should be said at the beginning<br />
					and say at the beginning what should be said at the end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you pondered<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> so long<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is reversed;<br />

					or unravel it if you can.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It seems that death verily stalked among the Jains who were Nātaputta's pupils.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Even the white-clad householders who were followers of Nātaputta the Jain were disgusted, disaffected, put off<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> by the Jains who were Nātaputta's pupils<br />
					in that the <i>dhamma</i> and discipline were badly set forth,<br />

					not conducing to peace,<br />
					expounded by one who was not fully self-awakened,<br />
					the foundations wrecked,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Cunda the novice,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having kept the rains at Pāvā,<br />

					having approached and greeted the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Cunda the novice spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, Nātaputta the Jain has recently died at Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the white-clad householders who were followers of Nātaputta the Jain were disgusted, disaffected, put off by the Jains who were Nātaputta's pupils<br />
					in that the <i>dhamma</i> and discipline were badly set forth,<br />

					not conducing to peace,<br />
					expounded by one who was not fully self-awakened,<br />
					the foundations wrecked,<br />
					without an arbiter.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the venerable Ānanda spoke <a id="pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a> thus to Cunda the novice:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly this, reverend Cunda,<br />
					is a subject on which to see the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, reverend Cunda,<br />
					we will approach the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					we will tell this matter to the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					Cunda the novice answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and Cunda the novice<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to me, revered sir,<br />
					that we should take care lest,<br />

					the five controlling faculties,<br />
					the five powers,<br />
					the seven links in awakening,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, those things taught to me by the Lord<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet, revered sir, those people who dwell dependent on the Lord<br />
