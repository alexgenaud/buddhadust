					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rāagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks,<br />
					living in their native district,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having kept the rains locally,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to these monks<br />

					at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is among the monks living in their native district,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					was sitting close to the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is profitable for the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					it is well gotten for the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					that his well informed fellow Brahma-farers<br />
					praise him point by point<br />
					when they are face-to-face with the Teacher,<br />
					and that the Teacher approves of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps I might meet the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's,<br />
					somewhere sometime.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps there might be some conversation (with him)."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having stayed near Rājagaha<br />
					for as long as he found suitable,<br />
					set out on tour for Sāvatthī;<br />
					in due courses,<br />
					walking on tour,<br />
					he arrived at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord stayed here near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta Grove<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son, heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say the Lord has reached Sāvatthī<br />
					and is staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta Grove<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					having packed away his bedding<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					set out on tour for Sāvatthī;<br />
					in due course,<br />
					walking on tour,<br />
					he approached Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Jeta Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery,<br />
					and the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted<br />
					the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					with talk on Dhamma<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted by the Lord's talk on Dhamma,<br />
					having rejoiced and being satisfied,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					and keeping <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> his right side towards him,<br />
					set out for the day-sojourn<br />
					in the Blind Men's Grove.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk<br />
					approached the venerable Sāriputta;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inasmuch as you, reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					are continually extolling the monk<br />
					called Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son, he<br />
					gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted by the Lord's talk on Dhamma,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br />
					and being satisfied,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord<br />
					and keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					is setting out for the Blind Men's Grove<br />
					for the day-sojourn."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					hurriedly taking his piece of cloth to sit upon,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					followed close after<br />
					the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					keeping him in sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son,<br />
					having plunged into the Blind men's grove,<br />
					sat down at the root of a tree<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					having also plunged into the Blind Men's Grove,<br />
					sat down at the root of a tree<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					having emerged from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greeting<br />
					with the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at one side,<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Puṇṇa, Mantāṇī's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence, is the Brahma-faring<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, your reverence,<br />

					<p class="f4">Your reverence,<br />
					it is as though while King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					was staying in Sāvatthī,<br />
					something to be done urgently<br />
					should arise in Sāketa,<br />
					and seven relays of chariots<br />
					would be arranged for him<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, your reverence,<br />
					King Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					having left Sāvatthī by the palace-gate,<br />
					might mount the first chariot in the relay,<br />
					and by means of the first chariot in the relay<br />
					he would reach the second chariot in the relay.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would dismiss<br />
					the first chariot in the relay<br />
					and would mount<br />
					the second chariot in the relay<br />
					and by means of that<br />
					he would reach the third chariot in the relay.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would dismiss<br />
					the second chariot in the relay<br />
					and would mount<br />
					the third chariot in the relay<br />
					and by means of that<br />
					he would reach the fourth chariot in the relay.</p>
