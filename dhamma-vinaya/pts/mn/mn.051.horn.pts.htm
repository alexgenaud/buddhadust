					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Cāmpa<br />
					on the bank of the Gaggarā lotus-pond<br />
					together with a large Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pessa, the son of an elephant-trainer,<br />
					and the wanderer Kandaraka<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					when they had approached,<br />
					Pessa, the son of the elephant-trainer,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the wanderer Kandaraka<br />
					exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance<br />
					the wanderer Kandaraka,<br />
					having looked round at the Order of monks<br />
					which became absolutely silent,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, good Gotama,<br />
					it is marvellous, good Gotama,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					how the Order of monks has been led<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> properly<br />
					by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, good Gotama,<br />
					those who in the long past were perfected ones,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened Ones -<br />
					did these Lords also<br />
					have an equally excellent Order of monks<br />
					that they led properly<br />
					even as the Order of monks<br />
					is now being led properly by the good Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">And, good Gotama,<br />
					those who in the distant future<br />
					will be perfected ones,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened Ones -<br />
					will these Lords also<br />
					have an equally excellent Order of monks<br />
					that they will lead properly<br />
					even as the Order of monks<br />
					is now being led properly by the good Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is so, Kandaraka;<br />
					it is so, Kandaraka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who, Kandaraka,<br />
					in the long past<br />
					were perfected ones,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened Ones -<br />
					these Lords had an equally excellent Order of monks<br />
					that they led properly,<br />
					even as the Order of monks<br />
					is now being led properly by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those, Kandaraka,<br />
					who in the distant future<br />
					<a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a> will be perfected ones,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened Ones -<br />
					these Lords will have an equally excellent Order of monks<br />
					that they will lead properly,<br />
					even as the Order of monks<br />
					is now being led properly by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">For there are, Kandaraka,<br />
					monks in this Order of monks<br />
					who are perfected ones,<br />
					the cankers destroyed,<br />
					who have lived the life,<br />
					done what was to be done,<br />
					shed the burden,<br />
					attained their own goal,<br />
					and who,<br />
					by the utter destruction of the fetters of becoming,<br />
					are freed by perfect profound knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there are, Kandaraka,<br />
					monks in this Order of monks<br />
					who are learners,<br />
					undeviating in moral habit,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					undeviating in conduct,<br />
					intelligent,<br />
					their ways of living intelligent,<br />
					and these dwell<br />
					with their minds well applied<br />
					to the four applications of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Kandaraka,<br />
					<a id="pt340" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg340"><span class="f2">[340]</span></a> a monk fares along<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Pessa, the son of an elephant-trainer,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, revered sir,<br />
					it is marvellous, revered sir,<br />

					are so well laid down by the Lord<br />

					for the going down of sufferings and miseries,<br />
					for winning the right path,<br />
					for realising nibbāna.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, revered sir,<br />
					it is marvellous, revered sir,<br />
					how the Lord knows the welfare<br />
					and woe of beings<br />
					while there is this human tangle,<br />
					this human guile,<br />
					this human treachery.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now I, revered sir,<br />
					am able to make an elephant under training so remember<br />
					that, every time he is coming into Cāmpa<br />
					or leaving it,<br />
					he will display all kinds of treachery,<br />
					deceit,<br />
					fraud,<br />
					trickery.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, revered sir,<br />
					those that are called our slaves<br />
					or messengers<br />
					or workpeople,<br />
					they do one thing with their body,<br />
					another in speech,<br />
					and their thought is still other.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">For this, revered sir, is a tangle,<br />

					<p class="f4">But this, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is so, Pessa,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt341" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg341"><span class="f2">[341]</span></a> For this, Pessa, is a tangle,<br />

					<p class="f4">But this, Pessa, is an open clearing,<br />

					<p class="f4">Pessa, these four kinds of persons<br />
					are found in the world.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Pessa,<br />
					some person is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment;</p>

					<p class="f4">as to this, Pessa,<br />
					some person is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others;</p>

					<p class="f4">as to this, Pessa,<br />
					some person is both a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting self,<br />
					and a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others;</p>

					<p class="f4">as to this, Pessa,<br />
					some person is neither a self-tormentor,<br />
					not intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					not intent on the practice of tormenting others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these four persons, Pessa,<br />
					which appeals to your mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br />
					that person who is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment -<br />
					that person does not appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir,<br />
					that person who is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others -<br />
					neither does <a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> that person appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir,<br />
					that person who is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					and who is also a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others -<br />
					neither does that person appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, revered sir,<br />
					that person who is neither a self-tormentor,<br />
					not intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					not intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					he, neither a self-tormentor<br />

					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become -<br />
					this person appeals to my mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why, Pessa,<br />
					do these three persons<br />
					not appeal to your mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir,<br />
					whatever person is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					he mortifies and torments himself<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					although he yearns for happiness<br />
					and recoils from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore this person<br />
					does not appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir,<br />
					whatever person is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					he mortifies and torments others<br />
					although they yearn for happiness<br />
					and recoil from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore this person<br />
					does not appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, revered sir,<br />
					whatever person is both a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment,<br />
					and also a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					he mortifies and torments himself and others<br />
					although they (all) yearn for happiness<br />
					and recoil from pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore this person<br />
					does not appeal to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, <a id="pt342" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg342"><span class="f2">[342]</span></a> revered sir,<br />
					whatever person is neither a self-tormentor,<br />

					he, neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahma-become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore this person<br />
					appeals to my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, revered sir, we must be going,<br />
					we are very busy,<br />
					there is much to be done by us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You must do, Pessa,<br />
					whatever you think it is now the right time for."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pessa, the son of the elephant trainer,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br />
					having given thanks,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after Pessa, the son of the elephant-trainer,<br />
					had departed, the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> "Monks, Pessa, the son of the elephant-trainer,<br />
					is clever;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					monks, Pessa, the son of the elephant-trainer,<br />
					is of great wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, Pessa, the elephant-trainer's son,<br />
					had sat down for a moment<br />
					whilst I had analysed<br />
					the four kinds of persons for him in detail,<br />
					he would have gained great good.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless,<br />
					even to some extent<br />
					has Pessa, the elephant-trainer's son,<br />
					gained great good."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is the right time for this, Lord<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it is the right time for this, Wellfarer -<br />
					for the Lord to analyse<br />
					these four persons in detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the monks have heard the Lord,<br />
					they will remember."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, monks, listen,<br />
					attend carefully,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which, monks,<br />
					is the self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />
					some person comes to be unclothed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					flouting life's decencies,<br />
					licking his hands (after meals),<br />
					not one to come when asked to do so,<br />
					not one to stand still<br />
					when asked to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not consent (to accept food)<br />
					offered or specially prepared (for him)<br />
					or (to accept) an invitation (to a meal).</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not accept (food)<br />
					straight from a cooking-pot or pan,<br />
					nor within the threshould,<br />
					nor among the faggots,<br />
					nor among the rice-pounders,<br />
					nor when two people are eating,<br />
					nor from a pregnant woman,<br />
					nor from one giving suck,<br />
					nor from one cohabiting with a man,<br />
					nor from gleanings,<br />
					nor from where a dog is standing by,<br />
					nor where flies are swarming,<br />
					nor fish,<br />
					nor meat.</p>

					<p class="f4">He drinks neither fermented liquor<br />
					nor spirits nor rice-gruel.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to be a one-house man<br />
					or a one-piece man,<br />
					or a two-house man<br />
					or a two-piece man
					or a three-house man<br />
					or a three-piece man
					or a four-house man<br />
					or a four-piece man
					or a five-house man<br />
					or a five-piece man
					or a six-house man<br />
					or a six-piece man
					or a seven-house man<br />
					or a seven-piece man.</p>

					<p class="f4">He subsists on one little offering<br />
					he subsists on two little offerings<br />
					he subsists on three little offerings<br />
					he subsists on four little offerings<br />
					he subsists on five little offerings<br />
					he subsists on six little offerings<br />
					he subsists on seven little offerings.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes food only once a day,<br />
					<a id="pt343" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg343"><span class="f2">[343]</span></a> and once in two days<br />
					and once in three days<br />
					and once in four days<br />
					and once in five days<br />
					and once in six days<br />
					and once in seven days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he lives intent<br />
					on such a practice<br />
					as eating rice<br />
					at regular fortnightly intervals.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one feeding on potherbs<br />
					or feeding on millet<br />
					or on wild rice<br />
					or on snippets of leather<br />
					or on water-plants<br />
					or on the red powder of rice husks<br />
					or on the discarded scum of rice on the boil<br />
					or on the flour of oil- <a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> seeds<br />
					or grass<br />
					or cowdung.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who subsists<br />
					on forest roots or fruits,<br />
					eating the fruits that have fallen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wears coarse hempen cloths<br />
					and he wears mixed cloths<br />
					or cerements<br />
					or rags taken from the dust-heap<br />
					or tree-bark fibre<br />
					or antelope skins<br />
					or strips of antelope skin<br />
					or cloths of <i>kusa</i>-grass<br />
					or cloths or bark<br />
					or cloths of wood shavings<br />
					or a blanket of human hair<br />
					or he wears owls' feathers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who plucks out<br />
					the hair of his head and beard,<br />
					intent on the practice<br />
					of plucking out the hair of the head and beard;<br />
					and he is one who stands upright,<br />
					refusing a seat;<br />
					and he is one who squats on his haunches,<br />
					intent on the practice of squatting;<br />
					and he is one for covered thorns,<br />
					he makes his bed on covered thorns;<br />
					and he lives intent on the practice<br />
					of going down to the water to bathe<br />
					three times in an evening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in many a way<br />
					does he live intent on the practice<br />
					of mortifying and tormenting his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is called<br />
					the person who is a self-tormentor,<br />
					intent on the practice of self-torment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And which, monks, is the person<br />
					who is a tormentor of others,<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />
					some person is a cattle-butcher,<br />

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />
