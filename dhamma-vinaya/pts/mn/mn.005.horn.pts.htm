					<p class="f4">While he was there the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Sāriputta in assent.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					for getting rid of that blemish;<br />
					he will pass away while he has attachment,<br />
					aversion,<br />
					and confusion,<br />
					while he has the blemish,<br />
					while his mind is tarnished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverence, it is like a bronze bowl,<br />

					covered with dust and dirt<br />
					and that the owners would not make use of or clean,<br />
					but would throw away in the dust.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence, your reverence,<br />
					would that bronze bowl<br />
					become more tarnished with dirt after a time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even while there was this reasoning<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 137 notes that there is both a conventional teaching and a teaching according to ultimate truth (<i>paramatthadesanā</i>}. Herein "individual person, being, woman, man, khattiya, brahman, deva, Māra" come under conventional meaning; and "impermanence, anguish, insubstantiality, the khandhas, the elements, the planes, the applications of mindfulness" under ultimate truth. "The four persons are to be understood in the conventional way" (<i>MA.</i> i. 139).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 139 calls this <i>sattaloka,</i> the world of beings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> 368: "attachment, hatred and folly are called the three blemishes."	<i>MA.</i> i. 139ff. equates them with the defilements, the <i>kilhesa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>sappaṭipuggala. MA.</i> i. 144 says this means "an equal person. 'Equal' means one who has an offence. <i>'Paṭipuggala'</i> means the reprover. He thinks it possible to say, wishing for reproof from one who has an offence, 'You have fallen into this and that offence. You can reprove me after you have confessed it.' Or, he may wish for reproof from one of his own birth, family, learning, experience, or ascetic practice."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> of the procession walking for almsfood to be put into their bowls.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 149 says that this may be due to three causes: because they are cut with a knife, sewn with a coarse long thread, or stained by dust.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Giribbaje. <i>MA.</i> i. 151 says, "it (Rājagaha) was called Giribbaja because it stood like a cattle pen (<i>vaja</i>) with a circle of mountains ail round." So Giribbaja, which is usually taken as a name for Rājagaha, is the Cowpen in the mountains which surround Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 151 explains <i>ājīvika</i> as <i>naggasamaṇa.</i> See A. L. Basham, <i>History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas,</i> London, 1951.</p>
