					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you, monks, remember<br />
					that I taught you about the five fetters<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, I, revered sir, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"But do you, Māluṇkyāputta, remember it<br />

					is a fetter binding to the lower (shore).</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda, listen,<br />

					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
