					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#bhagga">Bhaggas</a><br />
					in Suṁsumāragira<br />
					in Bhesakaḷā Grove<br />
					in the deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Prince Bodhi had a palace named Kokanada;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it had not long been built<br />
					and had had not (yet) been inhabited<br />
					by a recluse<br />
					or brahman<br />
					or by any human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, good Sañjikā's son,<br />
					approach the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head,<br />
					and ask whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort,<br />
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Prince Bodhi salutes the Lord's feet with his head<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And speak thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, may the Lord,<br />
					together with the Order of monks,<br />
					consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow<br />
					with Prince Bodhi.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"<br />
					and the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,<br />
					having answered Prince Bodhi in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the brahman youth Sañjikā's son<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama,<br />
					Prince Bodhi salutes with his head<br />
					the good Gotama's feet<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the revered Gotama,<br />
					together with the Order of monks,<br />
					consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow<br />
					with Prince Bodhi.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,<br />
					having understood the Lord's consent,<br />
					rising from his seat<br />
					approached Prince Bodhi;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I spoke in your name, good sir,<br />
					to the Lord Gotama,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama,<br />
					Prince Bodhi salutes with his head<br />
					the good Gotama's feet<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the revered Gotama,<br />
					together with the Order of monks,<br />
					consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow<br />
					with <a id="pg280"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span></a> Prince Bodhi.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the recluse Gotama consented."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, after Prince Bodhi had had sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					prepared in his own dwelling<br />
					towards the end of that night,<br />
					and had had the Kokanada palace<br />
					spread with white cloths<br />
					as far as the last<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> flight of stairs,<br />
					he addressed the brahman youth Sanjikā's son,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, good Sañjikā's son,<br />
					approach the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					announce the time to the Lord,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is time, revered sir,<br />
					the meal is ready.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, good sir,"<br />
					and the brahman youth Sañjikā's son,<br />
					having answered Prince Bodhi in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he announced the time to the Lord,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, revered sir,<br />
					the meal is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, dressing in the morning<br />
					and taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached Prince Bodhi's dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Prince Bodhi,<br />
					while he was waiting for the Lord,<br />
					was standing at the porch<br />
					of the outside gateway.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Prince Bodhi saw the Lord coming in the distance;<br />
					having seen him<br />
					and gone to meet him,<br />
					he greeted and honoured the Lord<br />
					and approached the Kokanada palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord stood<br />
					leaning against the last flight of stairs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths,<br />
					let the Well-farer step on the cloths<br />
					so that for a long time<br />
					it may be for my welfare and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Lord was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths,<br />
					let the Well-farer step on the cloths<br />
					so that for a long time<br />
					it may be for my welfare and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Lord was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths,<br />
					let the Well-farer step on the cloths<br />
					so that for a long time<br />
					it may be for my welfare and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord looked towards the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to Prince Bodhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Prince, have the cloths packed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord will not tread upon a cloth carpeting;<br />
					the Tathāgata looks towards<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the folk that come after."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Bodhi had the cloths packed away,<br />
					and had a seat made ready<br />
					upstairs in the Kokanada palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord<br />
					having ascended the Kokanada palace,<br />
					sat down on the seat made ready<br />
					together with the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Bodhi<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served and satisfied the Order of monks<br />
					with the Lord at its head<br />
					with sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the Lord had eaten<br />
					and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl,<br />
					Prince Bodhi, having taken a lower seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a> As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Prince Bodhi Spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, it has occurred to me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Happiness is not to be achieved through happiness;<br />
					happiness is to be achieved through suffering."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"To me too, Prince,<br />
					before my Awakening,<br />
					while I was still the bodhisatta,<br />
					not fully awakened,<br />
					it occurred:</p>

					<p class="f4">Happiness is not to be achieved through happiness;<br />
					happiness is to be achieved through suffering."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Prince, after a time, being young, my hair coal-black,<br />
					possessed of radiant youth,<br />
					in the prime of my life —<br />
					although my unwilling parents wept and wailed —<br />
					having cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					having put on yellow robes,<br />
					went forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, being gone forth thus,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, reverend Kālāma, want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Prince, Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br />
					this dhamma is such that an intelligent man,<br />
					having soon realised super-knowledge for himself<br />
					(as learnt from) his own teacher,<br />
					may enter on and abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					mastered that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, Prince, as far as mere lip service,<br />
					mere repetition<br />
					were concerned,<br />
					spoke the doctrine of knowledge,<br />
					and the doctrine of the elders,<br />
					and I claimed —<br />
					I as well as others —<br />
					that 'I know, I see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But Āḷāra the Kālāma does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br />
					simply out of faith:<br />
					Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					I am abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing, seeing this dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, Prince,<br />
					approach Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for yourself,<br />
					entering thereon,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince, Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy,<br />
					I too have energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness,<br />
					I too have mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration,<br />
					I too have concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive<br />
					for the realisation of that dhamma<br />
					which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims:<br />
					'Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					I am abiding therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on that dhamma,<br />
					abided therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Prince,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it to this extent<br />
					that you, reverend Kalama,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is to this extent<br />
					that I, your reverence,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br />
					having realised this dhamma<br />
					by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					am abiding in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br />
					it is well gotten for us, your reverence,<br />
					that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer<br />
					such as the venerable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This dhamma that I, entering on,<br />
					proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge;<br />
					the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that I,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that you know.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that you know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br />
					being just the two of us,<br />
					let us look after this group.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Prince,<br />
					did Āḷāra the Kālāma,<br />
					being my teacher,<br />
					set me — the pupil —<br />
					on the same level as himself<br />
					and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br />
					nor to dispassion<br />
					nor to stopping<br />
					nor to tranquillity<br />
					nor to super-knowledge<br />
					nor to awakening<br />
					nor to Nibbāna,<br />
					but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince,<br />
					not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Prince,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, your reverence,<br />
					want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Prince, Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">For surely Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then did I, Prince,<br />

					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince, Uddahka, Rāma's son,<br />
					proclaimed the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only Rāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince, not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monka, a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					walking on tour through Magadha<br />
					in due course arrived at Uruvela,<br />
					the camp township.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I saw a delightful stretch of land<br />
					and a lovely woodland grove,<br />
					and a clear flowing river<br />
					with a delightful ford,<br />
					and a village for support nearby.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it it is a delightful stretch of land,<br />
					and the woodland grove is lovely,<br />
					and the river flows clear<br />
					with a delightful ford,<br />
					and there is a village for support nearby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed this does well<br />
					for the striving<br />
					of a young man set on striving.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Prince,<br />
					three similes occurred to me spontaneously,<br />
					never heard before:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if there were a wet sappy stick placed in water;<br />
					then a man might come along<br />
					bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,<br />
					and thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will light a fire,<br />
					I will get heat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,<br />
					and rubbing that wet sappy stick<br />
					that had been placed in water (with it),<br />
					light a fire,<br />
					could he get heat?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, good Gotama,<br />
					that such a stick is wet and sappy<br />
					and that it was placed in water.</p>

					<p class="f4">That man would only get fatigue and distress."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In like manner, Prince,<br />
					whatever recluses or brahmans dwell not aloof<br />
					from pleasures of the senses that are bodily,<br />
					then if that which is for them,<br />
					among the sense-pleasures,<br />
					desire for sense-pleasure,<br />
					affection for sense-pleasure,<br />
					infatuation with sense-pleasure,<br />
					thirst for sense-pleasure,<br />
					fever for sense-pleasure -<br />

					<p class="f4">In addition to this, Prince,<br />
					<i>devatās</i>, having seen me, spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama has passed away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other <i>devatās</i> spoke thus;</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama has not passed away,<br />
					but he is passing away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other <i>devatās</i> spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama has not passed away,<br />
					nor is he passing away;<br />
					the recluse Gotama is a perfected one,<br />
					the mode of living of a perfected one<br />
					is just like this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose now that I should take the line<br />
					of desisting from all food?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, <i>devatās,</i><br />
					having approached me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not, good sir,<br />
					take the line of desisting from all food.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you, good sir,<br />
					take the line of desisting from all food,<br />
					then we will give you deva-like essences<br />
					to take in through the pores of the skin;<br />
					you will keep going by means of them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose that I should take the line<br />
					of not eating anything,<br />
					and these <i>devatās</i> were to give me deva-like essences<br />
					to take in through the pores of the skin,<br />
					and that I should keep going by means of them,<br />
					that would be an imposture in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince, rejected those <i>devatās</i><br />
					I said,<br />
					'Enough.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose now that I were to take food<br />
					little by little,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					such as bean-soup<br />
					or vetoh-soup<br />
					or chick-pea-soup<br />
					or pea-soup?</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince, took food<br />
					little by little,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					such as bean-soup<br />
					or veteh-soup<br />
					or chick-pea-soup<br />
					or pea-soup.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I, Prince, was taking food<br />
					little by little,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					such as bean-soup<br />
					or vetch-soup<br />
					or chick-pea-soup<br />
					or pea-soup,<br />
					my body became exceedingly emaciated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because I ate so little,<br />
					all my limbs became like the joints of withered creepers;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my protruding backbone<br />
					became like a string of balls;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my gaunt ribs<br />
					became like the crazy rafters<br />
					of a tumble-down shed;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					the pupils of my eyes<br />
					appeared lying low and deep;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk<br />
					as a bitter white gourd<br />
					cut before it is ripe<br />
					becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, Prince, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will touch the skin of my belly,'<br />
					it was my backbone that I took hold of.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will touch my backbone,'<br />
					it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of.</p>

					<p class="f4">For because I ate so little,<br />
					the skin of my belly, Prince,<br />
					came to be cleaving to my backbone.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, Prince, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will obey the calls of nature,'<br />
					I fell down on my face then and there,<br />
					because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, Prince, soothing my body,<br />
					stroked my limbs with my hand,<br />
					the hairs,<br />
					rotted at the roots,<br />
					fell away from my body<br />
					as I stroked my limbs with my hand,<br />
					because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, Prince, men,<br />
					having seen me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is black.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other men spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br />
					the recluse Gotama is deep brown.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some men spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br />
					he is not even deep brown,<br />
					the recluse Gotama is of a sallow colour.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To such an extent, Prince,<br />
					was my clear pure complexion<br />
					spoilt because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Prince, occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Some recluses and brahmans<br />
					in the past<br />
					have experienced feelings that were acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br />
					in the future<br />
					will experience feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br />
					are now<br />
					experiencing feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I,<br />
					by this severe austerity,<br />
					do not reach states of further-men,<br />
					the excellent knowledge and vision<br />
					befitting the ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be another way to awakening?</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Prince, occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know that while my father, the Sakyan,<br />
					was ploughing,<br />
					and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering on the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful,<br />
					and while abiding therein,<br />
					I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now could this be a way to awakening?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, following on my mindfulness, Prince,<br />
					there was the consciousness:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is itself the Way to awakening.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, am I afraid of that happiness<br />
					which is happiness<br />
					apart from sense-pleasures,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not afraid of that happiness<br />
					which is happiness<br />
					apart from sense-pleasures,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now it is not easy to reach that happiness<br />
					by thus subjecting the body<br />
					to extreme emaciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to take material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Prince, took material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time, Prince,<br />
					five monks were attending me<br />
					and (they thought):</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the recluse Gotama wins <i>dhamma</i><br />
					he will announce it to us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Prince, took material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk -<br />
					then these five monks turned on me in disgust,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama lives in abundance,<br />
					he is wavering in his striving,<br />
					he has reverted to a life of abundance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Prince, had taken some material nourishment,<br />
					having picked up strength,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture<br />
					I dwelt with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and I experienced in my person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of joy<br />
					and by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					I entered into<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">With the mind composed thus,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge and recollection<br />
					of former habitations:</p>

					<p class="f4">I remembered a variety of former habitations, thus:<br />
					one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration;<br />
					such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I remember divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Prince,<br />
					was the first knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the first watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the passing hence<br />
					and the arising of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					I see beings as they pass hence<br />
					or come to be;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds,<br />
					and I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in speech,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					do I see beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Prince,<br />
					was the second knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the middle watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma, won to by me<br />
					is deep,<br />
					difficult to see,<br />
					difficult to understand,<br />
					tranquil,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					beyond dialectic,<br />
					subtle,<br />
					intelligible to the learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this is a creation<br />
					delighting in sensual pleasure,<br />
					delighted by sensual pleasure,<br />
					rejoicing in sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that for a creation<br />
					delighting in sensual pleasure,<br />
					delighted by sensual pleasure,<br />
					rejoicing in sensual pleasure,<br />
					this were a matter difficult to see,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					causal uprising by way of condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too were a matter difficult to see,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					the tranquillising of all the activities,<br />
					the renunciation of all attachment,<br />
					the destruction of craving,<br />
					dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if I were to teach dhamma<br />
					and others were not to understand me,<br />
					that would be a weariness to me,<br />
					that would be a vexation to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Prince, these verses<br />
					not heard before in the past<br />
					spontaneously occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">This that through many toils I've won —<br />
					Enough! why should I make it known?<br />
					By folk with lust and hate consumed<br />
					This dhamma is not understood.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Leading on against the stream,<br />
					Deep, subtle, difficult to see, delicate,<br />
					Unseen 'twill be by passion's slaves<br />
					Cloaked in the murk of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise, as I was pondering, Prince,<br />
					my mind inclined to little effort<br />
					and not teaching dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					who knew with his mind<br />
					the reasoning in my mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas, the world is lost,<br />
					alas, the world is destroyed,<br />
					inasmuch as the mind of the Tathāgata,<br />
					the perfected one,<br />
					the fully awakened one,<br />
					inclines to little effort<br />
					and not to teaching dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince,<br />
					as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or might bend back his outstretched arm,<br />
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					vanishing from the Brahmā-world,<br />
					become manifest before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted me with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Lord teach dhamma,<br />
					let the well-farer teach dhamma;<br />
					there are beings with little dust in their eyes who;<br />
					not hearing dhamma,<br />
					are decaying,<br />
					(but if) they are learners of dhamma<br />
					they will grow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati to me, Prince;<br />
					having said this,<br />
					he further spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'There has appeared in Magadha before thee<br />
					An unclean dhamma by (minds) with stains devised.<br />
					Open this door of deathlessness; let them hear<br />
					Dhamma awakened to by the stainless one.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">As on a crag on crest of mountain standing<br />
					A man might watch the people all around,<br />
					E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br />
					O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<br />
					Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples<br />
					Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br />
					Thou leader of the caravan, without a debt!<br />
					Walk in the world. Let the Blessed One<br />
					Teach dhamma; they who learn will grow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then I, Prince, having understood Brahmā's entreaty,<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I, Prince, was surveying the world<br />
					with the eye of an Awakened One,<br />
					I saw beings with little dust in their eyes,<br />
					with much dust in their eyes,<br />
					with acute faculties<br />
					with dull faculties,<br />
					of good dispositions,<br />
					of bad dispositions,<br />
					docile,<br />
					indocile,<br />
					few seeing from fear<br />
					sins and the world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as in a pond of blue lotuses<br />
					or in a pond of red lotuses<br />
					or in a pond of white lotuses,<br />
					a few red lotuses,<br />
					a few blue lotuses,<br />
					a few white lotuses<br />
					are born in the water,<br />
					grow in the water,<br />
					do not rise above the water<br />
					but thrive while altogether immersed;<br />
					a few blue lotuses,<br />
					a few red lotuses,<br />
					a few white lotuses<br />
					are born in the water,<br />
					grow in the water<br />
					and reach the surface of the water<br />
					a few blue lotuses,<br />
					a few red lotuses,<br />
					a few white lotuses<br />
					are born in the water,<br />
					grow in the water<br />
					and stand rising out of the water,<br />
					undefiled by the water;<br />
					even so did I, Prince,<br />
					surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One,<br />
					see beings with little dust in their eyes,<br />
					with much dust in their eyes,<br />
					with acute faculties,<br />
					with dull faculties,<br />
					of good dispositions,<br />
					of bad dispositions,<br />
					docile,<br />
					indocile,<br />
					few seeing from fear<br />
					sins and the world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Prince, addressed Brahmā Sahampati in verses:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Opened for those who hear are the doors of the Deathless, Brahmā,<br />
					Let them give forth their faith;<br />
					Thinking of useless fatigue, Brahmā, I have not preached dhamma<br />
					Sublime and excellent for men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, Brahmā Sahampati, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The opportunity was made by me<br />
					for the Lord to teach dhamma,'</p>

					<p class="f4">having greeted me,<br />
					keeping his right side towards me,<br />
					vanshed then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, to whom should I first teach this dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will understand this dhamma quickly?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this Āḷāra the Kālāma is learned,<br />
					experienced,<br />
					wise,<br />
					and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to teach dhamma first to Āḷāra the Kālāma<br />
					he will understand this dhamma quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then devatās having approached me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So knowledge and vision arose in me<br />
					that Āḷāra the Kālāma had passed away seven days ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Āḷāra the Kālāma has suffered a great loss.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if he had heard this dhamma,<br />
					he would have understood it quickly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, to whom could I first teach this dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will understand this dhamma quickly?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Uddaka, Rāma's son, is learned,<br />
					experienced,<br />
					wise,<br />
					and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to teach dhamma first to Uddaka, Rāma's son?</p>

					<p class="f4">He will understand this dhamma quickly,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, <i>devatās,</i> having approached me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Uddaka, Rāma's son, passed away last night,'</p>

					<p class="f4">So knowledge and vision arose in me<br />
					that Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />
					had passed away last night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Uddaka, Rāma's son, has suffered a great loss.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if he had heard this dhamma,<br />
					he would have understood it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now to whom could I first teach this dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will understand this dhamma quickly?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Prince:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This group of five monks<br />
					who waited on me<br />
					when I was self-resolute in striving,<br />
					were very helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to teach dhamma first to this group of five monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But where is the group of five monks staying at present?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks I saw with deva-vision,<br />
					purified<br />
					and surpassing that of men,<br />
					the group of five monks<br />
					staying near Benares<br />
					at Isipatana<br />
					in the deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks, having stayed at Uruvelā<br />
					for as long as I found suiting,<br />
					set out on tour for Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, <a id="upaka" href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/upaka.htm">Upaka</a>,<br />
					the Naked Ascetic,<br />
					saw me as I was going along the high road<br />
					between Gayā and the (Tree of) Awakening;<br />
					having seen me,<br />
					he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverence,<br />
					your faculties are quite pure,<br />
					your complexion is very bright,<br />
					very clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">On account of whom<br />
					have you, your reverence, gone forth,<br />
					or who is your teacher,<br />
					or whose dhamma do you profess?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, monks, addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic,<br />
					in verses:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'Victorious over all, omniscient am I,<br />
					Among all things undefiled,<br />
					Leaving all, through death of craving freed,<br />
					By knowing for myself, whom should I point to?</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">For me there is no teacher,<br />
					One like me does not exist,<br />
					In the world with its devas<br />
					No one equals me.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">For I am perfected in the world,<br />
					A teacher supreme am I,<br />
					I alone am all-awakened,<br />
					Become cool am I, Nibbāna-attained.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">To turn the dhamma-wheel<br />
					I go to Kasi's city,<br />
					Beating the drum of deathlessness<br />
					In a world that's blind become.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'According to what you claim, your reverence,<br />
					you ought to be victor of the unending.'</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">'Like me, they are victors indeed<br />
					Who have won destruction of the cankers;<br />
					Vanquished by me are evil things,<br />
					Therefore am I, Upaka, a victor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince,<br />
					Upaka the Naked Ascetic, having said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May it be (so), your reverence"</p>

					<p class="f4">having shaken his head,<br />
					went off having taken a different road.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Prince, walking on tour,<br />
					in due course arrived at Benares,<br />
					Isipatana,<br />
					the deer-park<br />
					and the group of five monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prince, the group of five monks<br />
					saw me coming in the distance,<br />
					and seeing me<br />
					they agreed among themselves, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming,<br />
					he lives in abundance,<br />
					he is wavering in his striving,<br />
					he has reverted to a life of abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should be neither greeted,<br />
					nor stood up for,<br />
					nor should his bowl and robe be received;<br />
					all the same<br />
					a seat may be put out,<br />
					he can sit down if he wants to.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But as I, Prince, gradually approached this group of five monks,<br />
					so this group of five monks<br />
					were not able to adhere to their own agreement;<br />
					having approached me<br />
					some received my bowl and robe,<br />
					some made a seat ready,<br />
					some brought water for washing the feet,<br />
					and they addressed me by my name<br />
					and with the epithet 'your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, Prince, spoke thus to the group of five monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not, monks, address a Tathāgata by his name<br />
					or by the epithet 'your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the Tathāgata is one perfected, a fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear, monks, the deathless is found,<br />
					I instruct, I teach dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,<br />
					having soon realised here and now<br />
					by your own super-knowledge<br />
					that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring<br />
					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness,<br />
					you will abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince,<br />
					the group of five monks addressed me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But you, reverend Gotama,<br />
					did not come to a state of further-men,<br />
					to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans<br />
					by this conduct,<br />
					by this course,<br />
					by this practice of austerities.</p>

					<p class="f4">So how can you now<br />
					come to a state of further-men,<br />
					to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans<br />
					when you live in abundance<br />
					and, wavering in your striving,<br />
					revert to a life of abundance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince, I spoke to the group of five monks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					does not live in abundance<br />
					nor, wavering in striving,<br />
					does he revert to a life of abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					is one perfected,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear, monks,<br />
					the deathless is found,<br />
					I instruct,<br />
					I teach dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,<br />

					into homelessness,<br />
					you will abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time, Prince, the group of five monks spoke to me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But you, reverend Gotama,<br />
					did not come to a state of further-men,<br />
					to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans<br />
					by this conduct,<br />
					by this course,<br />
					by this practice of austerities.</p>

					<p class="f4">So how can you now<br />
					come to a state of further-men,<br />
					to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans<br />
					when you live in abundance<br />
					and, wavering in your striving,<br />
					revert to a life of abundance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince, I spoke to the group of five monks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					does not live in abundance<br />
					nor, wavering in striving,<br />
					does he revert to a life of abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					is one perfected,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear, monks,<br />
					the deathless is found,<br />
					I instruct,<br />
					I teach dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,<br />

					into homelessness,<br />
					you will abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time, monks, the group of five monks spoke to me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But you, reverend Gotama,<br />
					did not come to a state of further-men,<br />
					to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans<br />
					by this conduct,<br />
					by this course,<br />
					by this practice of austerities.</p>

					<p class="f4">So how can you now<br />
					come to a state of further-men,<br />
					to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans<br />
					when you live in abundance<br />
					and, wavering in your striving,<br />
					revert to a life of abundance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, Prince, spoke thus to the group of five monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you allow, monks,<br />
					that I have ever spoken to you like this before?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have not, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					is one perfected,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear, monks,<br />
					the deathless is found,<br />
					I instruct,<br />
					I teach dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going along in accordance with what is enjoined,<br />

					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness,<br />
					you will abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, Prince, was able to convince the group of five monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prince, I now exhorted two monks;<br />
					three monks walked for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever the three monks who had walked for alms- food brought back,<br />
					that the group of six lived on.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then, Prince, I exhorted three monks;<br />
					two monks walked for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever the two monks who had walked for almsfood brought back,<br />
					that the group of six lived on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, the group of five monks,<br />
					being thus exhorted,<br />
					thus instructed by me,<br />
					soon realising here and now<br />
					by their own super-knowledge<br />
					that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					entering on it abided in it."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"After how long, revered sir,<br />
					does a monk<br />
					taking the Tathāgata as a leader,<br />
					and having by his own super-knowledge<br />
					realised here and now<br />
					that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					entering on it, abide in it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Prince,<br />
					I will ask you a question about this in return.</p>

					<p class="f4">As it may please you,<br />
					so should you answer it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you skilled in elephant-riding,<br />
					in the art of handling a goad?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, I, revered sir, am skilled in elephant-riding,<br />
					in the art of handling a goad."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">A man might come along here, and think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Prince Bodhi knows how to ride elephants<br />
					and the art of handling the goad.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will train myself in elephant-riding<br />
					and the art of handhng the goad under him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But had he no faith<br />
					he could not attain<br />
					whatever is to be won by faith;<br />
					and had he <a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> poor health<br />
					he could not attain<br />

					he could not attain<br />
					whatever is to be won by one of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that man train himself<br />
					in elephant-riding<br />
					and the art of handling the goad under you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Assuredly, revered sir,<br />
					if that man were possessed of (such) qualities,<br />

					<p class="f4">But who speaks of five qualities?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">A man might come along here, and think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Prince Bodhi knows how to ride elephants<br />

					<p class="f4">I will train myself in elephant-riding<br />

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that man train himself in elephant-riding<br />
					and in the art of handling the goad under you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Assuredly, revered sir,<br />
					if that man were possessed of (such) qualities,<br />
					he could train himself in elephant-riding<br />
					and the art of handhng the goad under me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But who speaks of five qualities?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Prince,<br />
					are these five qualities for striving.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Prince,<br />
					a monk has faith;<br />
					he has faith in the awakening of the Tathāgata, and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this is the Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and men,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He is well,<br />
					in good health,<br />
					endowed with a good digestion,<br />
					not over-cool,<br />
					not over-hot,<br />
					but of a middle kind<br />
					suitable for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not fraudulent,<br />
					not deceitful,<br />
					but shows himself as he really is<br />
					to the Teacher<br />
					or the learned<br />
					among his fellow Brahma-farers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with energy stirred up<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for getting rid of unskilled states,<br />
					for arousing skilled states,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					firm in advance,<br />
					persevering amid skilled states.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one of wisdom<br />
					endowed with wisdom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					leading to (the cutting off of) rise and fall,<br />
					with ariyan<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> discrimination<br />
					leading to the complete destruction of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"So this revered Bodhi speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'O what an Awakened One,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do not, good Sañjikā's son, speak thus;<br />
					do not, good Sañjikā's son, speak thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face with my mother,<br />
					good Sañjikā's son,<br />
					have I heard this,<br />

					<p class="f4">There was a time, good Sañjikā's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then my nurse,<br />

					<p class="f4">As she was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
