<meta name="description" content="I.B. Horner's translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 40. The Buddha explains the unreasonableness of such superficial practices as the wearing of robes, going naked, living in filth, ceremonial bathing, living at the root of a tree, eating according to a set regimin, chanting, or wearing matted hair in the hope of ridding one's self of malevolence, wrath, grudge-bearing, hypocrisy, spite, jealousy, stingyness, treachery, craftyness, evil desires and wrong views. Then he explains the manner in which practicing friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment rids one of those bad characteristics and leads on to attaining arahantship." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#assapura">Aŋgas</a>;<br />
					a township of the Aŋgas was called Assapura.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg335"><span class="f2 g"><b>[335]</b></span></a> "Revered one,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Recluses, recluses,'<br />
					so the people know you, monks,<br />
					and you, on being asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who are yon?'</p>

					<p class="f4">should acknowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are recluses.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such being your, designations, monks,<br />
					such being your vocations,<br />
					thus you should train yourselves, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will follow those practices<br />
					which are fitting for recluses;<br />
					thus will this designation of ours<br />
					become true<br />
					and the vocation real;<br />
					and the gifts of those things we make use of -<br />
					robe-material,<br />
					almsfood,<br />
					lodging,<br />
					medicines for the sick -<br />
					will come to be of great fruit,<br />
					of great advantage to us;<br />
					and this our going forth<br />
					will come to be not barren<br />
					but fruitful<br />
					and growing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, does a monk come to be one<br />
					who is not following the practice<br />
					that is fitting for recluses?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in any monk who is covetous,<br />
					covetousness not got rid of;<br />
					who is malevolent in mind,<br />
					malevolence not got rid of;<br />
					who is wrathful,<br />
					wrath not got rid of;<br />

					who is of evil desires,<br />
					evil desires not got rid of;<br />
					who is of wrong view,<br />
					wrong view not got rid of -<br />
					I, monks, say<br />
					that if he does not follow<br />
					the practice fitting for recluses,<br />
					there is no getting rid of these stains on recluses,<br />
					defects in recluses,<br />
					faults in recluses,<br />
					occasions for the sorrowful states,<br />
					of what is to be experienced in a bad bourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as a deadly weapon<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> for fighting with,<br />
