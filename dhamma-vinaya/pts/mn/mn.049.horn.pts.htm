					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At one time I, monks, was staying at Ukkaṭṭhā<br />
					in the Subhaga Grove<br />
					near the great sāl-tree.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, monks,<br />
					an evil wrong view<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					came to have accrued to Baka the Brahmā<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is permanent,<br />
					this is stable,<br />
					this is eternal,<br />
					this is entire,<br />
					this is not liable to passing away,<br />
					this is not born,<br />
					does not age,<br />
					does not die,<br />
					does not pass away,<br />
					does not uprise,<br />
					and there is not another further escape from this.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, monks,<br />
					knowing with my mind<br />
					the reasoning in the mind of Baka the Brahmā,<br />
					as a <a id="pg389"><span class="f2 g"><b>[389]</b></span></a> strong man might bend back his outstretched arm<br />
					or might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					so, vanishing from near the great sāl-tree<br />
					in the Subhaga Grove at Ukkaṭṭhā,<br />
					did I appear in that Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Baka the Brahmā saw me coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing me, he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good sir,<br />
					you are welcome, good sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">At last, good sir,<br />
					you make this occasion for coming here.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But this, good sir, is permanent,<br />
					this is stable,<br />
					this is eternal,<br />
					this is entire,<br />
					this is not liable to passing away,<br />
					this is not born,<br />
					nor does it age<br />
					or die<br />
					or pass away<br />
					or uprise,<br />
					and there is not another further escape from this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, monks, spoke thus to Baka the Brahma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, Baka the Brahma is steeped in ignorance,<br />
					indeed, Baka the Brahma is steeped in ignorance,<br />
					inasmuch as he says</p>

					<p class="f4">"permanent"<br />
					although it is indeed impermanent,<br />
					"stable"<br />
					although it is indeed unstable,<br />
					"eternal"<br />
					although it is indeed not eternal,<br />
					"entire"<br />
					although it is indeed not entire,<br />
					"not liable to passing away"<br />
					although it is indeed liable to passing away,<br />
					and because in regard to what is born,<br />
					and ages<br />
					and dies<br />
					and passes away<br />
					and uprises,<br />
					he says:<br />
					"This is not born,<br />
					nor does it age<br />
					or die<br />
					or pass away<br />
					or uprise,"<br />
					and although there is another further escape,<br />
					he says:<br />
					"There is not another further escape."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Māra the Evil One,<br />
					having entered a certain company of Brahmas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, monk,<br />
					do not meddle with this,<br />
					do not meddle with this.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, monk,<br />
					this Brahmā<br />
					is a Great Brahmā,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Victor,<br />
					Unvanquished,<br />
					All-seeing,<br />
					Controller,<br />
					Lord,<br />
					Maker,<br />
					Creator,<br />
					Chief,<br />
					Disposer,<br />
					Master,<br />
					Father of all that have become<br />
					and will be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you<br />
					who scorned extension,<br />
					loathed extension,<br />
					who scorned cohesion,<br />
					loathed cohesion,<br />
					who scorned heat,<br />
					loathed heat,<br />
					who scorned motion,<br />
					loathed motion,<br />
					who scorned creatures,<br />
					loathed creatures,<br />
					who scorned devas,<br />
					loathed devas,<br />
					who scorned Pajāpati,<br />
					loathed Pajāpati,<br />
					who scorned Brahmā,<br />
					loathed Brahmā<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					these at the breaking up of the body,<br />
					at the Cutting off of life,<br />
					were established in a low group.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But, monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you, <a id="pg390"><span class="f2 g"><b>[390]</b></span></a> who lauded extension,<br />
					delighted in extension,<br />
					who lauded cohesion,<br />
					delighted in cohesion,<br />
					who lauded heat,<br />
					delighted in heat,<br />
					who lauded motion,<br />
					delighted in motion,<br />
					who lauded creatures,<br />
					delighted in creatures,<br />
					who lauded devas,<br />
					delighted in devas,<br />
					who lauded Pajāpati,<br />
					delighted in Pajāpati,<br />
					who lauded Brahmā,<br />
					delighted in Brahmā -<br />
					these at the breaking up of the body,<br />
					at the cutting off of life,<br />
					were established in an excellent group.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On account of this do I, monk, speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Please do you, good sir,<br />
					do exactly what Brahmā says to you,<br />
					do not go beyond Brahmā's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you, monk, should go beyond Brahmā's word,<br />
					it will be with you, monk,<br />
					as with a man who might beat back approaching glory<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> with a stick,<br />
					or, monk, as with a man who might miss<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> the earth<br />
					with his hands and feet<br />
					as he was falling down hell's precipices.</p>

					<p class="f4">Please do you, good sir,<br />
					do exactly what Brahmā says to you,<br />
					do not go beyond Brahmā's word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not you, monk,<br />
					see the seated company of Brahmā?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so, monks, Māra the Evil One<br />
					conducted me to the company of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br />
					I, monks, spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, Evil One, know you;<br />
					do not think that I do not know you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Māra, you are the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whoever, Evil One,<br />
					is a Brahmā,<br />
					and whatever are Brahmā-companies,<br />
					and whatever are Brahmā-conclaves,<br />
					all are in your grasp,<br />
					all are in your power.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurs to you thus, Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let this one too be in my grasp,<br />
					let this one too be in my power.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, Evil One, am not in your grasp,<br />
					I am not in your power.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had said this, monks,<br />
					Baka the Brahmā spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But I, good sir, say "permanent"<br />
					because it is permanent,<br />
					I say "stable"<br />
					because it is stable,<br />
					I say "eternal"<br />
					because it is eternal,<br />
					I say "entire"<br />
					because it is entire,<br />
					I say "not liable to passing away"<br />
					because it is not liable to passing away,<br />
					and of what is not born,<br />
					does not age,<br />
					die,<br />
					pass away<br />
					and uprise,<br />
					this is just what I say:<br />
					"This is not born,<br />
					it does not age,<br />
					it does not die,<br />
					it does not pass away,<br />
					it does not uprise;"<br />
					and because there is not another further escape,<br />
					I say, "There is not another further escape."</p>

					<p class="f4">There were, monk, recluses and brahmans in the world before you<br />
					who practised austerities<br />
					for a term as long as your whole life.</p>

					<p class="f4">These would know thus:<br />
					either, if there is another further escape:<br />
					There is another further escape;<br />
					or, if there is not another further escape:<br />
					There is not another further escape.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monk, say this to you:</p>

					<p class="f4">You will never see another further escape<br />
					however <a id="pg391"><span class="f2 g"><b>[391]</b></span></a> much yon may go in for toil and trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if you, monk, would ascertain<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> extension,<br />
					you will become near to me,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					reposing on my substance,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain cohesion,<br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain heat,<br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain motion,<br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain creatures,<br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain <i>devas,</i><br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain Pajāpati,<br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you would ascertain Brahmā,<br />
					you will become near to me,<br />
					reposing on my substance,<br />
					to be done to as I will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'But I too, Brahma, know this:</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain extension,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />
					reposing on your substance,<br />
					to be done to as you will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain cohesion,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />
					reposing on your substance,<br />
					to be done to as you will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain heat,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />
					reposing on your substance,<br />
					to be done to as you will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain motion,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />
					reposing on your substance,<br />
					to be done to as you will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain creatures,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />
					reposing on your substance,<br />
					to be done to as you will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain <i>devas,</i><br />
					I will become near to you,<br />

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain Pajāpati,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />

					<p class="f4">If I were to ascertain Brahmā,<br />
					I will become near to you,<br />
					reposing on your substance,<br />
					to be done to as you will,<br />
					dwarfed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover I both comprehend your bourn, Brahmā,<br />
					and I comprehend your splendour:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Baka the Brahma is of great psychic power thus,<br />
					Baka the Brahma is of great majesty thus,<br />
					Baka the Brahma is of great fame thus.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">As far as moon and sun revolve in their course<br />
							And light up all the quarters with their radiance,<br />
							So far extends the thousand-world system:<br />
							Here your sway is exercised.<br />
							But do you know the distinctions?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The passionate and dispassionate likewise?<br />
							The becoming thus, the becoming otherwise,<br />
							The coming and the going of beings?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that I, Brahmā,<br />
					both comprehend your bourn<br />
					and comprehend your splendour:<br />
					Baka the Brahma is of great psychic power thus,<br />
					Baka the Brahma is of great majesty thus,<br />
					Baka the Brahma is of great fame thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there are, Brahmā,<br />
					three other classes<br />
					which you do not know,<br />
					do not see,<br />
					but which I know and see.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Brahmā,<br />
					the class called Radiant ones<br />
					from which you have passed away,<br />

					but because of your very long abiding<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> (here),<br />
					the recollection of it is confused,<br />
					and <a id="pg392"><span class="f2 g"><b>[392]</b></span></a> because of that<br />
					you neither know nor see it;<br />
					I know and see it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I, Brahmā, am not merely on an exact equality with you<br />
					as regards super-knowledge;<br />
					how could I be lower,<br />
					since I am indeed greater than you?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Brahmā, the class called Lustrous ones<br />
					which you neither know nor see,<br />

					<p class="f4">There is, Brahmā, the class called Vehapphala<br />

					<p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you,<br />

					<p class="f4">These, having communicated to disciples<br />

					having craved for disciples<br />
					and for those who had gone forth,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monk, there were recluses and brahmans in the world before you,<br />

					these did not communicate to disciples<br />
					or to those who had gone forth;<br />

					<p class="f4">These, not having communicated to disciples<br />

					so do not instruct others.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, I, monks,<br />
					spoke thus to Māra the Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know you, Evil One,<br />
					do not think:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He does not know me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, you are Māra.</p>

					<p class="f4">You do not speak to me thus, Evil One,<br />
					because you are friendly<br />
					and compassionate;<br />
					you speak to me thus, Evil One,<br />
					because you are not friendly,<br />
					not compassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you think thus, Evil One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Those to whom the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					will get beyond my reach.</p>

					<p class="f4">Although those recluses and brahmans, Evil One,<br />
					who claimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We are fully self-awakened ones,"</p>

					<p class="f4">were not fully self-awakened ones,<br />
					nevertheless I, Evil One,<br />
					who claim:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am a fully self-awakened one,"</p>

					<p class="f4">am indeed a fully self-awakened one.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Evil One,<br />
					whether a Tathāgata is teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples,<br />
					he is such a one;<br />
					whether, Evil One,<br />
					a <i>Tathāgata</i> is not teaching <i>Dhamma</i> to disciples,<br />
					he is such a one;<br />
					whether, Evil One,<br />
					a <i>Tathāgata</i> is communicating it to disciples,<br />
					he is such a one;<br />
					whether, Evil One,<br />
					a Tathāgata is not communicating it to disciples,<br />
					he is such a one.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, in a <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					those cankers which are connected with the defilements,<br />
					with again-becoming,<br />
					fearful,<br />
					whose results are anguish,<br />
					which make for birth,<br />
					ageing and dying <a id="pg395"><span class="f2 g"><b>[395]</b></span></a> in the future,<br />
					these are got rid of,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump<br />
					so that they can come to no further existence in the future.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One,<br />
					as a palm-tree whose crown has been cut off<br />
					cannot put forth growth again,<br />
					even so, Evil One,<br />
					in a Tathāgata those cankers which are connected with the defilements,<br />
					with again-becoming,<br />
					fearful,<br />
					whose results are anguish,<br />
					which make for birth,<br />
					ageing and dying in the future,<br />
					these are got rid of,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump<br />
					that can come to no further existence in the future.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of Māra's failure to persuade (me)<br />
					and because of the invitation to a Brahmā,<br />
					a synonym for this homily is therefore<br />
					A challenge to a Brahmā."</p>
