					<p class="f4">'When, Ānanda, the Bodhisatta is issuing from his mother's womb,<br />
					he issues quite stainless,<br />
					undefiled by watery matter,<br />
					undefiled by mucus,<br />
					undefiled by blood,<br />
					undefiled by any impurity,<br />
					pure and unstained.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, it is as when a jewel is laid on Benares muslin,<br />
					neither does the jewel stain the Benares muslin<br />
					nor does the Benares muslin stain the jewel.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is due to the purity of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Ānanda, when the Bodhisatta is issuing from his mother's womb,<br />
					he issues quite stainless,<br />
					undefiled by watery matter,<br />
					undefiled by mucus,<br />
					undefiled by blood,<br />
					undefiled by any impurity,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Five kinds of freedom given at <i>MA.</i> iv. 168, <i>DA.</i> ii. 426: freed by eliminating (the hindrances); freed for certain; freed by cutting off (the defilements); freed by the subsiding of the defilements; the freedom of escape (which is nibbāna).
