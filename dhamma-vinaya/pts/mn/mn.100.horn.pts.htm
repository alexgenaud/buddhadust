					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was walking on tour among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans</a><br />
					together with a large Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman lady called Dhānañjānī,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who had confident belief in the Awakened One,<br />
					in <i>dhamma</i><br />
					and in the Order,<br />
					was residing in Caṇḍalakappa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman lady Dhānañjānī,<br />
					having tripped,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					three times uttered this solemn utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Praise to that Lord,<br />
					perfected One,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Praise to that Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Praise to that Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman youth Saŋgārava<br />
					was residing in Caṇḍalakappa;<br />
					he was master of the three Vedas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					versed in the vocabularies and rituals<br />
					together with the phonology and exegesis<br />
					and the legendary tradition as the fifth;<br />
					he was learned in idioms,<br />
					a grammarian,<br />
					proficient in popular philosophy<br />
					and the marks of a Great Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman youth Saŋgārava heard what the brahman lady <a id="pg399"><span class="f2 g"><b>[399]</b></span></a> Dhānañjānī was saying;<br />
					on hearing it<br />
					he spoke thus to the brahman lady Dhānañjānī:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This brahman lady Dhānañjānī is mean,<br />
					this brahman lady Dhānañjānī is disgraced<br />
					in that,<br />
					while there are brahmans in existence,<br />
					she speaks in praise<br />
					of this little shaveling recluse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But do not you, dear learned friend,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					know this Lord's moral habit and wisdom?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If you, dear learned friend,<br />
					were to know this Lord's moral habit and wisdom,<br />
					you, dear learned friend,<br />
					would not consider that this Lord<br />
					should be abused and reviled."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, lady,<br />
					if the recluse Gotama arrives in Caṇḍalakappa,<br />
					you might let me know."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, learned friend,"<br />
					the brahman lady Dhānañjānī<br />
					answered the brahman youth Saŋgārava<br />
					in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as the Lord was walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					he gradually arrived at Caṇḍalakappa.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the Lord stayed in the mango grove<br />
					of the brahmans of Tudi.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman lady Dhānañjānī<br />
					heard that the Lord had arrived at Caṇḍalakappa<br />
					and was staying in the mango grove<br />
					of the brahmans of Tudi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman lady Dhānañjānī<br />
					approached the brahman youth Saŋgārava;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					she spoke thus to the brahman youth Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dear learned friend,<br />
					this Lord has arrived at Caṇḍalakappa<br />
					and is staying in the mango grove<br />
					of the brahmans of Tudi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dear learned friend,<br />
					you must do now that<br />
					for which you think it the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lady,"<br />
					and the brahman youth Saŋgārava,<br />
					having answered the brahman lady Dhānañjānī in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Saŋgārava the brahman youth<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, good Gotama,<br />
					some recluses and brahmans who claim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they <a id="pg400"><span class="f2 g"><b>[400]</b></span></a> have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond<br />
					through super-knowledge.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Among those recluses and brahmans, good Gotama,<br />
					who elaim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge -<br />
					of which (sort) is the revered Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, Bhāradvāja, say<br />
					that there is a difference among those who claim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					some recluses and brahmans who depend on report;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					these claim that it is through report<br />
					that, in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge -<br />
					such as the three-Veda-brahmans.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there are, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					some recluses and brahmans<br />
					who with only mere faith<br />
					claim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge -<br />
					such as reasoners<br />
					and investigators.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There are, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					some recluses and brahmans<br />
					who by fully understanding <i>dhamma</i><br />
					of themselves only,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					although these truths had not been heard before,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					claim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					I am one of those recluses and brahmans<br />
					who by fully understanding <i>dhamma</i><br />
					of themselves only,<br />
					although these truths had not been heard before,<br />
					claim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must understand it in this way, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					that I am one of those recluses and brahmans<br />
					who by fully understanding <i>dhamma</i><br />
					of themselves only,<br />
					although these truths had not been heard before,<br />
					claim that,<br />
					in regard to the fundamentals of the Brahma-faring,<br />
					they have attained here-now<br />
					to excellence<br />
					and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> Bhāradvāja,<br />
					before my Self-awakening<br />
					while I was still <a id="pg401"><span class="f2 g"><b>[401]</b></span></a> the bodhisatta,<br />
					not fully awakened,<br />
					it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Narrow ia the household life,<br />
					a path of dust,<br />
					going forth is in the open,<br />
					nor is it easy<br />
					while dwelling in a house<br />
					to lead the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled,<br />
					completely purified,<br />
					polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					after a time,<br />
					being young,<br />
					my hair coal-black,<br />
					possessed of radiant youth,<br />
					in the prime of my life —<br />
					although my unwilling parents wept and wailed — having cut off my hair and beard, having put on yellow robes, went forth from home into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, being gone forth thus,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, reverend Kālāma, want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Bhāradvāja, Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br />
					this dhamma is such that an intelligent man,<br />
					having soon realised super-knowledge for himself<br />
					(as learnt from) his own teacher,<br />
					may enter on and abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					mastered that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, Bhāradvāja, as far as mere lip service,<br />
					mere repetition<br />
					were concerned,<br />
					spoke the doctrine of knowledge,<br />
					and the doctrine of the elders,<br />
					and I claimed —<br />
					I as well as others —<br />
					that 'I know, I see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But Āḷāra the Kālāma does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br />
					simply out of faith:<br />
					Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					I am abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing, seeing this dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					approach Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for yourself,<br />
					entering thereon,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Bhāradvāja, Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy,<br />
					I too have energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness,<br />
					I too have mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration,<br />
					I too have concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive<br />
					for the realisation of that dhamma<br />
					which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims:<br />
					'Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					I am abiding therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on that dhamma,<br />
					abided therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it to this extent<br />
					that you, reverend Kalama,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is to this extent<br />
					that I, your reverence,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br />
					having realised this dhamma<br />
					by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					am abiding in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br />
					it is well gotten for us, your reverence,<br />
					that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer<br />
					such as the venerable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This dhamma that I, entering on,<br />
					proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />

					the dhamma that you,<br />

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that you know,<br />

					as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br />
					being just the two of us,<br />
					let us look after this group.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					did Āḷāra the Kālāma,<br />
					being my teacher,<br />
					set me — the pupil —<br />
					on the same level as himself<br />
					and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br />
					nor to dispassion<br />
					nor to stopping<br />

					nor to super-knowledge<br />

					but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Bhāradvāja,<br />

					<p class="f4">In addition to this, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					<i>devatās</i>, having seen me, spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama has passed away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other <i>devatās</i> spoke thus;</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama has not passed away,<br />
					but he is passing away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other <i>devatās</i> spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama has not passed away,<br />
					nor is he passing away;<br />
					the recluse Gotama is a perfected one,<br />
					the mode of living of a perfected one<br />
					is just like this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose now that I should take the line<br />
					of desisting from all food?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Bhāradvāja, <i>devatās,</i><br />
					having approached me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not, good sir,<br />
					take the line of desisting from all food.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you, good sir,<br />
					take the line of desisting from all food,<br />
					then we will give you deva-like essences<br />
					to take in through the pores of the skin;<br />
					you will keep going by means of them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Bhāradvāja, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose that I should take the line<br />
					of not eating anything,<br />
					and these <i>devatās</i> were to give me deva-like essences<br />
					to take in through the pores of the skin,<br />
					and that I should keep going by means of them,<br />
					that would be an imposture in me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja, rejected those <i>devatās</i><br />
					I said,<br />
					'Enough.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose now that I were to take food<br />
					little by little,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					such as bean-soup<br />
					or vetoh-soup<br />
					or chick-pea-soup<br />
					or pea-soup?</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja, took food<br />
					little by little,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					such as bean-soup<br />
					or veteh-soup<br />
					or chick-pea-soup<br />
					or pea-soup.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I, Bhāradvāja, was taking food<br />
					little by little,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					such as bean-soup<br />
					or vetch-soup<br />
					or chick-pea-soup<br />
					or pea-soup,<br />
					my body became exceedingly emaciated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because I ate so little,<br />
					all my limbs became like the joints of withered creepers;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my protruding backbone<br />
					became like a string of balls;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my gaunt ribs<br />
					became like the crazy rafters<br />
					of a tumble-down shed;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					the pupils of my eyes<br />
					appeared lying low and deep;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk<br />
					as a bitter white gourd<br />
					cut before it is ripe<br />
					becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, Bhāradvāja, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will touch the skin of my belly,'<br />
					it was my backbone that I took hold of.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will touch my backbone,'<br />
					it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of.</p>

					<p class="f4">For because I ate so little,<br />
					the skin of my belly, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					came to be cleaving to my backbone.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, Bhāradvāja, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will obey the calls of nature,'<br />
					I fell down on my face then and there,<br />
					because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, Bhāradvāja, soothing my body,<br />
					stroked my limbs with my hand,<br />
					the hairs,<br />
					rotted at the roots,<br />
					fell away from my body<br />
					as I stroked my limbs with my hand,<br />
					because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, Bhāradvāja, men,<br />
					having seen me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is black.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other men spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br />
					the recluse Gotama is deep brown.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some men spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br />
					he is not even deep brown,<br />
					the recluse Gotama is of a sallow colour.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To such an extent, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					was my clear pure complexion<br />
					spoilt because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Bhāradvāja, occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Some recluses and brahmans<br />
					in the past<br />
					have experienced feelings that were acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br />
					in the future<br />
					will experience feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br />
					are now<br />
					experiencing feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I,<br />
					by this severe austerity,<br />
					do not reach states of further-men,<br />
					the excellent knowledge and vision<br />
					befitting the ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be another way to awakening?</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Bhāradvāja, occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know that while my father, the Sakyan,<br />
					was ploughing,<br />
					and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering on the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful,<br />
					and while abiding therein,<br />
					I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now could this be a way to awakening?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, following on my mindfulness, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					there was the consciousness:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is itself the Way to awakening.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, am I afraid of that happiness<br />
					which is happiness<br />
					apart from sense-pleasures,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not afraid of that happiness<br />
					which is happiness<br />
					apart from sense-pleasures,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now it is not easy to reach that happiness<br />
					by thus subjecting the body<br />
					to extreme emaciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to take material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Bhāradvāja, took material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					five monks were attending me<br />
					and (they thought):</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the recluse Gotama wins <i>dhamma</i><br />
					he will announce it to us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Bhāradvāja, took material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk -<br />
					then these five monks turned on me in disgust,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama lives in abundance,<br />
					he is wavering in his striving,<br />
					he has reverted to a life of abundance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Bhāradvāja, had taken some material nourishment,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having picked up strength,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture<br />
					I dwelt with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and I experienced in my person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the third meditation.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of joy<br />
					and by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					I entered into<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">With the mind composed thus,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge and recollection<br />
					of former habitations:</p>

					<p class="f4">I remembered a variety of former habitations, thus:<br />

					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration;<br />
					such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I remember divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					was the first knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the first watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the passing hence<br />
					and the arising of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					I see beings as they pass hence<br />
					or come to be;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds,<br />
					and I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in speech,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					do I see beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					was the second knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the middle watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is anguish,<br />
					this is the arising of anguish,<br />
					this is the stopping of anguish,<br />
					this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the cankers,<br />
					this is the arising of the cankers,<br />
					this is the stopping of the cankers,<br />
					this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing this thus,<br />
					seeing thus,<br />
					my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of sense-pleasures,<br />
					and my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of becoming,<br />
					and my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom<br />
					the knowledge came to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am freed;</p>

					<p class="f4">and I comprehended:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or such.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					was the third knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the last watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman youth Saŋgārava spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed the good Gotama's striving was steadfast,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					indeed it was that of a true man<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					such as that of a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, good Gotama,<br />
					are there devas?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					it is known to me that there are devas."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg402"><span class="f2 g"><b>[402]</b></span></a> "But why do you, good Gotama,<br />
					on being asked if there are <i>devas</i><br />
					say that it is certainly known to you<br />
					that there are devas?</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if this is so, good Gotama,<br />
					is it not a vain falsehood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If on being asked, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					'Are there devas?<br />
					one should say:<br />
					'There are devas'<br />
					and should say:<br />
					'Certainly they are known to me,'<br />
					then the conclusion to be reached<br />
					by an intelligent person<br />
					is indubitable,<br />
					namely that there are devas."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why did not the revered Gotama<br />
					explain this to me at the beginning?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is commonly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> agreed in the world, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					that there are devas."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman youth Saŋgārava<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br />
					excellent, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the Lord<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> Gotama for refuge,<br />
					and to <i>dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br />
					as a lay-follower,<br />
					one gone for refuge from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Six other Saŋgārava suttas are given in <i>DPPN.,</i> but probably not all were addressed to the Saŋgārava of this <i>M.</i> Sta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See <i>S.</i> i. 160; and <i>K.S.</i> i. 199, <i>n.</i> 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> There are several v.ll, for this name, <i>MA.</i> iii. 451 for example reading Maṇḍalakappa. It was a little village.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The text reading is <i>upakkhalitvā,</i> which means having tripped or stumbled; <i>S.</i> i. 160 (in a rather different context) reads <i>upakkamitvā,</i> having approached or gone on to, with v.l. <i>upakkhalitvā;</i> <i>MA.</i> iii. 451 reads <i>pakkhalitvā,</i> which can mean either "having washed" or "having stumbled." Brahmans often wash before a ceremonial event, but I have chosen to render by "tripped" in conformity with the textual meaning. The <i>udāna</i> (solemn utterance) would then be an expression used for warding off the ill-luck which might otherwise ensue after stumbling. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Mhvu.</i> iii. 223.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> ii. 133.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>bhadramukha,</i> as at <i>M.</i> ii. 53. See above, p. 249, <i>n.</i> 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> sīlapaññāṇa, as at <i>D.</i> i. 124. See note at <i>Dial.</i> i. 156.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Todeyyānaṁ brāhmaṇānaṁ.</i> These brahmans were so-called because they lived in Tudi (-gāma), Only the one was called Todeyya because he was the head of these; see above, p. 386, <i>n.</i> 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 453 says of <i>ādibrahmacariyaṁ: brahmacariyassa ādibhūtā uppādakā jānakā ti,</i> which seems to mean that they were producers and generators of the Brahma-faring; but the grammar is against this. I think it more likely that the "fundamentals of the Brahma-faring" refer to "the practices that have been pointed out by me for disciples," enumerated in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77"><i>M.</i> Sta. 77.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> As at <i>A.</i> iii. 9; <i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> ii. 33; <i>S.</i> ii. 9, 105. "Truths" is <i>dhammesu,</i> which <i>AA.</i> iii. 225 explains as <i>catu-saccadhammesu. Dhammā</i> can also mean things; or mental states, elements or ultimates.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> As	at	<i>M.</i> i. 240.</p>
