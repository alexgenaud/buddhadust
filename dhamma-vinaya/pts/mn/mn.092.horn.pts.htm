					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord walking on tour among the people of Anguttarāpa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					with twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					arrived at the market town called Āpaṇa<br />
					belonging to the people of Anguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily the recluse Gotama,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					having gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					walking on tour among the people of Anguttarāpa<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					with twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					has reached Āpaṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg333"><span class="f2 g"><b>[333]</b></span></a> The most lovely report has gone abroad thus<br />
					concerning this revered Gotama:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br />
					he makes known this world<br />
					together with devas<br />
					including the Māras and the Brahmās;<br />
					creatures<br />
					together with recluses and brahmans,<br />
					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle<br />
					and lovely at the ending;<br />
					he explains with the spirit and the letter<br />
					the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled<br />
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br />
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the matted hair ascetic Keṇiya<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the Lord delighted,<br />
					roused,<br />
					inspired,<br />
					gladdened him<br />
					with talk on dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic,<br />
					delighted,<br />
					roused,<br />
					inspired,<br />
					gladdened by the Lord<br />
					with talk on dhamma,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May the good Gotama<br />
					together with the Order of monks<br />
					consent to a meal with me<br />
					on the morrow."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus<br />
					to Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Keṇiya,<br />
					great is the Order of monks,<br />
					twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					and you are favourably disposed towards<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> the brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time did Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					speak thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Although, good Gotama,<br />
					the Order of monks is large,<br />
					twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					and although I am favourably disposed towards the brahmans,<br />
					(yet) may the good Gotama consent to a meal with me<br />
					on the morrow<br />
					together with the Order of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time did the Lord speak thus<br />
					to Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Keṇiya,<br />
					great is the Order of monks,<br />
					twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					and you are favourably disposed towards the brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time did Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					speak thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Although, good Gotama,<br />
					the Order of monks is large,<br />
					twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					and although I am favourably disposed towards the brahmans,<br />
					(yet) may the good Gotama consent to a meal with me<br />
					on the morrow<br />
					together with the Order of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic,<br />
					having understood the Lord's consent,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					approached his own hermitage;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he addressed his friends and acquaintances,<br />
					his kith and kin,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my good friends and acquaintances,<br />
					my kith and kin,<br />
					hear that the recluse Gotama<br />
					together with the Order of monks<br />
					has been invited <a id="pg334"><span class="f2 g"><b>[334]</b></span></a> by me for a meal on the morrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">So would you do personal service for me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, good sir,"<br />
					and when the friends and acquaintances,<br />
					the kith and kin of Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					had answered him in assent,<br />
					some dug pits (for the fire),<br />
					some chopped sticks,<br />
					some washed pots,<br />
					some put out jars of water,<br />
					and some got ready the seats,<br />
					while Keṇiya himself<br />
					prepared a pavilion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sela the brahman<br />
					was living in Āpaṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was master of the three Vedas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					versed in the vocabularies and rituals<br />
					together with the phonology and exegesis<br />
					and the legendary tradition as the fifth;<br />
					he was learned in idioms,<br />
					a grammarian,<br />
					proficient in popular philosophy<br />
					and the marks of a Great Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">He instructed three hundred brahman youths in mantras.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					was favourably disposed towards the brahman Sela.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as Sela the brahman,<br />
					surrounded by the three hundred brahman youths,<br />
					was pacing up and down<br />
					and roaming about on foot<br />
					he approached the hermitage of Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in the hermitage of Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					Sela the brahman saw some people digging pits,<br />
					some chopping sticks,<br />
					some washing pots,<br />
					some putting out jars of water,<br />
					and some getting ready the seats,<br />
					while Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic himself<br />
					prepared a pavilion.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he spoke thus to Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How now, is there to be a marriage<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at the good Keṇiya's<br />
					or a giving in marriage,<br />
					or is a great oblation arranged,<br />
					or has King Bimbisāra of Magadha<br />
					been invited for the morrow<br />
					together with his troops?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Sela, there is to be no marriage with me<br />
					nor giving in marriage,<br />
					nor has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha<br />
					been invited for the morrow<br />
					together with his troops.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have arranged a great oblation:<br />
					the recluse Gotama,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					who has been walking on tour among the people of Aṅguttarapa,<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					with twelve hundred and fifty monks,<br />
					has arrived at Āpaṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4">The most lovely report has gone abroad thus concerning the recluse Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has been invited by me for the morrow<br />
					together with the Order of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg335"><span class="f2 g"><b>[335]</b></span></a> "Keṇiya, did you say<br />
					'Awakened One'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I did say 'Awakened One,' Sela."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Keṇiya, did you say 'Awakened One'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I did say 'Awakened One,' Sela."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the brahman Sela:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even this sound 'Awakened One'<br />
					is hard to come by in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in our mantras<br />
					the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					are traditional.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a Great Man endowed with these,<br />
					only two courses are open, not another . . .</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he goes forth from home into homelessness<br />
					he becomes a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					a lifter of the world's veil.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a Great Man<br />
					possessed of these<br />
					only two courses are open,<br />
					not another:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If he settles in the household state<br />
					he becomes a king who is a wheel-turner,<br />
					a <i>Dhamma</i>-man,<br />
					a king under <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the ruler of the whole world,<br />
					one who brings stability to his realm;<br />
					and he is possessed of the seven Treasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven Treasures of his are<br />
					the wheel-treasure,<br />
					the elephant-treasure,<br />
					the horse-treasure,<br />
					the jewel-treasure,<br />
					the woman-treasure,<br />
					the householder-treasure,<br />
					the adviser-treasure as the seventh.</p>

					<p class="f4">He will have more than a thousand sons,<br />
					valiant,<br />
					built on heroic lines,<br />
					able to crush opposing armies.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells conquering this sea-girt land<br />
					by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					not by stick,<br />
					not by sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if he goes forth from home<br />
					into homelessness<br />
					he becomes a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					a lifter of the world's veil.</p>

					<p class="f4">And where, good Keṇiya,<br />
					is this revered Gotama,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					staying at present?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Keṇiya<br />
					the matted hair ascetic,<br />
					stretching out his right arm,<br />
					spoke thus to Sela the brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There, good Sela,<br />
					by that dark blue line of forest."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sela the brahman<br />
					with the three hundred brahman youths<br />
					approached the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sela the brahman<br />
					addressed these brahman youths,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come quietly, good sirs,<br />
					(carefully) placing foot after foot;<br />
					for, like lone-faring lions,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					these Lords are hard to approach.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if I should hold converse with the recluse Gotama,<br />
					do not interrupt me, good sirs;<br />
					but wait for me<br />
					until the end of the conversation."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sela the brahman approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					Sela the brahman looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					on the Lord's body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And Sela the brahman<br />
					saw all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					on the Lord's body<br />
					except two.</p>

					<p class="f4">About these two marks of a great man<br />
					he was in doubt,<br />
					perplexed,<br />
					uncertain,<br />
					not satisfied -<br />
					whether what was cloth-hid was sheath-cased<br />
					and whether the tongue was large.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This Sela the brahman sees on me<br />
					all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man<br />
					except two.</p>

					<p class="f4">About these two marks of a Great Man<br />
					he is in doubt,<br />
					perplexed,<br />
					uncertain,<br />
					not satisfied:<br />
					whether what is cloth-hid is sheath-cased<br />
					and whether my tongue is large."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord contrived such a contrivance of psychic power<br />
					that Sela the brahman saw<br />
					that that which the Lord had cloth-hid was sheath-cased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having put out his tongue,<br />
					stroked it backwards and forwards<br />
					over both his ears<br />
					and he stroked it backwards and forwards<br />
					over both his nostrils<br />
					and he covered the whole dome of his forehead<br />
					with his tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to Sela the brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man in full,<br />
					not partially,<br />
					but yet I do not know<br />
					whether he is an Awakened One or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">All the same,<br />
					I have heard it said<br />
					by aged brahmans,<br />
					full of years,<br />
					teachers of teachers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When their own praises are being spoken,<br />
					those that are perfected ones,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened Ones<br />
					reveal the self.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose <a id="pg336"><span class="f2 g"><b>[336]</b></span></a> that I,<br />
					face to face with the recluse Gotama<br />
					were to praise him in suitable verses?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sela the brahman,<br />
					face to face with the Lord,<br />
					praised him in suitable verses:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sela</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Your<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> body is complete,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> gleaming, finely proportioned,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> beautiful to behold;<br />

							Your eyes are clear, the face is full,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> you are well grown,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> straight, splendid;<br />
							in the midst of an Order of recluses you shine like the sun.<br />

							but for this recluseship what use is such supremacy of colour?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
							You should be a king, a wheel-tumer, a bull of charioteers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span><br />
							victor over the whole world, chief of the Rose-apple Grove.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					 		Nobles and wealthy kings will be your vassals;<br />
							you are king of kings, the lord of men; rule, 0 Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg337"><span class="f2 g"><b>[337]</b></span></a> Gotama</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"I am a king, Sela,<br />
							a matchless king under dhamma;<br />
							I turn the wheel by dhamma,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
							the wheel that cannot be turned back."</p>

					<p class="f4">Sela</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Self-Awakened do you profess to be,<br />
							'A matchless king under dhamma;<br />
							I turn the wheel by <i>Dhamma</i>' - thus, Gotama, you speak.<br />
							But who is the revered one's captain,<br />
							the disciple second to the Teacher?<br />
							Who turns on this wheel of <i>Dhamma</i><br />
							That was set turning by you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The wheel set turning by me, Sela,<br />
							The matchless wheel of <i>Dhamma</i> -<br />
							Sāriputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> turns it on;<br />

							What is to be known is known by me,<br />

							what is to be got rid of has been got rid of -<br />
							therefore, brahman, am I Awake.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Dispel your doubt in me, have faith, brahman.<br />
							Ever difficult to come by is the sight of Self-Awakened Ones.<br />
							Ever difficult to come by is their appearance in the world.<br />
							But I, brahman, am Self-Awakened, a physician without peer,<br />
							Brahma-become, without compare, crushing Māra's hosts;<br />
							having mastered all foes I rejoice, with no fear from anywhere."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg338"><span class="f2 g"><b>[338]</b></span></a> Sela</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Attend to this, good sirs. As speaks the Visioned One,<br />
							physician, great hero, so roars the forest-lion.<br />
							Seeing him, Brahma-become, without compare, crushing Māra's hosts,<br />

							Who wishes, let him follow me; or, who wishes it not, let him depart;<br />
							but I will go forth here under Him of Excellent Wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmans</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"If this teaching of the fully Self-Awakened One is agreeable to your reverence,<br />
							we too will go forth under Him of Excellent Wisdom."</p>

					<p class="f4">Sela</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"These three hundred brahmans, their palms joined in salutation, are asking<br />
							to fare the Brahma-faring under you, 0 Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Well taught<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> is the Brahma-faring, Sela,<br />
							It is self-realised, it is timeless.<br />
							The going forth in it is nothing vain for him who trains diligently."</p>

					<p class="f4">Sela the brahman and his company<br />
					received the going forth under the Lord,<br />
					they received ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then towards the end of that night,<br />
					Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic,<br />
					having had sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					prepared in his own hermitage,<br />
					had the time announced to the Lord,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, good Gotama,<br />
					the meal is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					dressing in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached the hermitage<br />
					of the matted hair ascetic Keṇiya;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat<br />
					together with the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served and satisfied the Order of monks<br />
					with the Awakened One at its head<br />
					with sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord had eaten<br />
					and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br />
					Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic,<br />
					taking a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Keṇiya the matted hair ascetic<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord thanked him in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Sacrifice is chief in fire-worship,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Sāvitrī chief of Vedic metres,<br />
							<a id="pg339"><span class="f2 g"><b>[339]</b></span></a> A king is chief of men,<br />
							The ocean chief of waters.<br />
							The moon is chief of the lamps of night,<br />
							The sun the chief of luminaries,<br />
							For those giving alms, desiring merit,<br />
							The Order is indeed the chief."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord had thanked the matted hair ascetic Keṇiya in these verses,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
