					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there, the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just here<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is a recluse,<br />

					<p class="f4">But this situation occurs, monks,<br />
					when wanderers belonging to other sects<br />
					might herein speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What confidence have the venerable ones,<br />
					what authority,<br />
					by reason of which the venerable ones speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just here is a recluse,<br />

					void of recluses are other (systems teaching) alien views?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if there are wanderers belonging to other sects who speak thus,<br />
					they should be spoken to thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is because we see for ourselves<br />

					<p class="f4">It is, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these four (kinds of) grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The grasping of sense-pleasures,<br />

					<p class="f4">There are some recluses and brahmans who,<br />

					but do not lay down a comprehension of the grasping of view,<br />
					of the grasping of rule and custom,<br />

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that these worthy recluses and brahmans<br />
