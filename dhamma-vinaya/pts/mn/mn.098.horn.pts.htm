					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Icchānaŋkala in a forest glade near Icchānaŋkala.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time many wealthy and distinguished brahmans<br />
					were living in Icchānaŋkala,<br />
					such as the brahman Cankī,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the brahman Tārukkha,<br />
					the brahman Pokkharasāti,<br />
					the brahman Jāṇussoṇi,<br />
					the brahman Todeyya,<br />
					and other wealthy and distinguished brahmans.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then as the brahman youths Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were pacing up and down<br />
					and roaming about on foot,<br />
					this chance conversation arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is one a brahman?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman youth Bhāradvāja spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one is of pure birth<br />
					on both the mother's and the father's side,<br />
					<a id="pg380"><span class="f2 g"><b>[380]</b></span></a> and is of pure descent<br />
					back through seven generations,<br />
					unchallenged and irreproachable in respect of birth,<br />
					then is one a brahman."</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman youth Vāseṭṭha spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one is of moral habit<br />
					and right practice,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					then is one a brahman."</p>

					<p class="f4">But neither was Bhāradvāja the brahman youth<br />
					able to convince Vāseṭṭha the brahman youth,<br />
					nor was Vāseṭṭha the brahman youth<br />
					able to convince Bhāradvāja the brahman youth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vāseṭṭha the brahman youth<br />
					spoke thus to Bhāradvāja the brahman youth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhāradvāja, this recluse Gotama,<br />
					the son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from a Sakyan clan,<br />
					is staying near Icchānaŋkala,<br />
					in a forest glade near Icchānaŋkala.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a lovely report has gone abroad about the recluse Gotama thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, good Bhāradvāja;<br />
					we will approach the recluse Gotama,<br />
					and having approached<br />
					we will ask the recluse Gotama about this matter,<br />
					and as the recluse Gotama explains it to us,<br />
					so will we accept it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir,"<br />
					the brahman youth Bhāradvāja answered<br />
					the brahman youth Vāseṭṭha in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman youths Vāseṭṭha<br />
					and Bhāradvāja<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Vāseṭṭha the brahman youth<br />
					addressed the Lord in these verses:</p>

					<p class="f4">Vāseṭṭha:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Both of us have been recognised as<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> and we claim to be three-Veda-(men),<br />
							I, of Pokkharasāti (a pupil), this brahman youth of Tārukkha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							In what is pointed out of the three Vedas - in that we are whole:<br />
							We are versed in the <i>pada-pāṭha,</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> grammarians, in speaking we are like teachers.<br />
							<a id="pg381"><span class="f2 g"><b>[381]</b></span></a>There is contention between us, Gotama, in respect of birth:<br />
							'By birth one is a brahman' - so speaks Bhāradvāja;<br />
							But I say, 'By doing'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> - let the Visioned One know it thus.<br />
							As we are each unable to convince the other,<br />
							We come to ask the revered Self-Awakened One, widely famed.<br />
							As people salute the moon when it has come to the full,<br />
							So, in the world, honouring him, do they thus praise Gotama.<br />
							We are asking Gotama, the Eye risen in the world:<br />
							Is one by birth a brahman or does one (so) become by doing?<br />
							Tell us this who know not, that a brahman we may know."</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Vāseṭṭha, I will expound<br />
							To you in gradual and very truth<br />
							Division in the kinds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> of living things;<br />
							For kinds divide.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Behold the grass and trees!<br />
							They reason not, yet they possess the mark<br />
							After their kind, for kinds indeed divide.<br />
							Consider then the beetles, moths and ants:<br />
							They after their kind too possess the mark<br />
							After their kind, for kinds indeed divide.<br />
							And so four-footed creatures, great and small<br />
							They after their kind too possess the mark<br />
							After their kind, for kinds indeed divide.<br />
							The reptiles, snakes, the long-backed animals<br />
							They after their kind too possess the mark<br />
							After their kind, for kinds indeed divide.<br />
							<a id="pg382"><span class="f2 g"><b>[382]</b></span></a> Fish and pond-feeders, water-denizens<br />
							They after their kind too possess the mark<br />
							After their kind, for kinds indeed divide.<br />
							Birds and the winged creatures, fowls o' the air,<br />
							They after their kind all possess the mark<br />
							For kinds indeed divide. Each after his kind bears<br />
							His mark; in man there is not manifold.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Not in the hair or head or ears or eyes,<br />
							Not in the mouth or nose or lips or brows,<br />
							Not in the throat, hips, belly or the back,<br />
							Not in the rump, sex-organs or the breast,<br />
							Not in the hands or feet, fingers or nails,<br />
							Not in the legs or thighs, colour or voice,<br />
							Is mark that forms his kind as in all else.<br />
							Nothing unique<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> is in men's bodies found:<br />
							The difference in men is nominal.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The man forsooth who earns his livelihood<br />
							By minding cows and fields, know, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
							He is a farmer, not a brahmana!<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">What the world holds as 'name' and 'lineage'<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg385"><span class="f2 g"><b>[385]</b></span></a> By deeds one is a farmer and by deeds<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">By deeds one is a servant and a thief,<br />

							And even so a rajah is by deeds.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Tis thus in truth the wise perceive the deed,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Revolves by deeds, mankind revolves by deeds;<br />
							As pin holds fast the rolling chariot's wheel,<br />
							So beings are in bondage held by deeds.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">A brahman one becomes by Brahma-faring,<br />
							By temperance, austerity, restraint:<br />
							This is indeed supreme for brahmanhood.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Who by three Vedas is accomplished,<br />
							With no more coming here, and man-of-calm,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, the brahman youths Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, good Gotama,<br />
					wonderful, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">We are going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and to <i>dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the good Gotama accept us<br />
					as lay-disciples,<br />
					going for refuge from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The text of this Discourse is not given in <i>M.</i> ii. It is the same as the Vāseṭṭha Suttta at <i>Sn.</i> p. 115 <i>ff.</i> The <i>Comys</i> (<i>SnA</i> 462 <i>ff.</i> and <i>MA.</i> iii. 431 <i>ff.</i>) show several interesting variations. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>D.</i> i. 235 <i>ff.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 431 says that Cankī and the four others were priests of King Pasenadi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 431: "every six months they gather together in two places: if they want to purify (their) birth <i>(jātiɱ sodhetukāmā),</i> then for this purpose they gather together at Ukkaṭṭhā under Pokkharasāti. If they want to purify the <i>mantras,</i> then they gather together at Icchānaŋkala. At this time they gathered together there for purifying the <i>mantras.</i>" <i>SnA</i> 462 says that they were there for meditating upon and thoroughly examining the Vedas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> iii. 432 = <i>SnA.</i> 463, in explanation of <i>kammanā</i> (<i>Sn.</i> 696) say: "to say one 'is of moral habit' <i>(sīlava)</i> refers to the sevenfold ways of skilled <i>kamma</i> in gesture and speech; referring to the threefold <i>kamma</i> of mind, one says 'endowed with right practice' <i>(vat(t)a-sampanna)".</i>  See <i>M.</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p41">Sta. 41</a> for this tenfold way of skilled action.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> An educated brahman who can pronounce each word in a <i>mantra</i> separately "without coalescence or <i>saɱdhi</i> and with its own specific accent" is a <i>padaka,</i> <i>i.e.</i> versed in Vedic lines and words. See R. N. Dandekar, <i>Cultural Background of the Vedas,</i> UCR. vol. XI, Nos. 3 and 4, July-October, 1953, p. 139.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>kammanā,</i> see above, p. 380, <i>n.</i> 4. It therefore appears to mean by accomplished training, that is in <i>sīla</i> and mind development; and thus has no pronounced reference to past <i>kamma</i> working in the present. <i>P.E.D.</i> gives "by character." In the following verses, <i>e.g.</i> 650 <i>ff.</i>, I follow E. M. Hare in translating as "deeds." <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sn.</i> 136: <i>kammanā vasalo hoti kammanā hoti brāhmano,</i> which <i>SnA.</i> 183 explains as: "he is an outcaste from thriving on impure <i>kamma,</i> a brahman from driving out what is impure by means of pure <i>kamma</i> "(or, "doing," <i>kammunā,</i> where <i>kammunā,</i> is but a variant of the instrumental <i>kammanā</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> From here to the end of the verses I give E. M. Hare's translation in <i>Woven Cadences.</i></p>

The second was after they had heard the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p13"><i>Tevijja Sutlanta</i> (<i>D.</i> Sta. 13);</a> a few days afterwards they "went forth", were ordained and attained arahantship. <i>DA.</i> 406 refers to the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p27"><i>Aggañña Sutta</i> (<i>D.</i> Sta. 27)</a> for this event, which <i>DA.</i> 872 states to be the case.</p>
