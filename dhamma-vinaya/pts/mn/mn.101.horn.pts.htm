					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">A market town of the Sakyans was called Devadaha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, monks, some recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br />
					and are of these views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever this individual experiences,<br />
					whether pleasant<br />
					or painful<br />
					or neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					all is due to what was previously done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by making and end<br />
					of ancient deeds,<br />
					by the non-doing of new deeds,<br />
					there is no overflowing into the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">From there being no overflowing into the future<br />
					comes the destruction of deeds;<br />
					from the destruction of deeds<br />
					comes the destruction of anguish;<br />
					from the destruction of anguish<br />
					comes the destruction of feeling;<br />
					from the destruction of feeling<br />
					all anguish will become worn away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Jains speak thus, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monks, speak thus-having approached Jains,<br />
					I speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, as is said, reverend Jains,<br />
					that you speak thus<br />
					and are of these views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever this individual experiences,<br />
					whether pleasant<br />
					or painful<br />
					or neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					all is due to what was previously done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<br />
					by making and end<br />
					of ancient deeds,<br />

					there is no overflowing into the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">From there being no overflowing into the future<br />

					comes the destruction of anguish;<br />
					from the destruction of anguish<br />
					comes the destruction of feeling;<br />
					from the destruction of feeling<br />
					all anguish will become worn away.'?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, these Jains<br />
					on being asked this by me<br />
					acknowledge it,<br />
					saying 'Yes',<br />
					then I speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains, know<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that you yourselves were in the past,<br />
					that you were not not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains, know<br />
					that you yourselves did this evil deed in the past,<br />
					that you did not not do it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains, know<br />
					that you did not do an evil deed like this<br />
					or like that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains, know<br />
					that so much anguish is worn <a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a> away,<br />
					or that so much anguish is to be worn away,<br />
					or that when so much anguish is worn away,<br />
					all anguish will become worn away?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains, know<br />
					the getting rid of unskilled states of mind<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the arising of skilled states?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'From what you say, reverend Jains,<br />
					you do not know whether you yourselves were in the past,<br />
					or whether you were not not;<br />
					you do not know whether in the past<br />
					you yourselves did this evil deed,<br />
					or whether you did not not do it;<br />
					you do not know whether you did an evil deed<br />
					like this or like that;<br />
					you do not know that so much anguish is worn away,<br />
					or that so much anguish is to be worn away,<br />
					or that when so much anguish is worn away,<br />
					all anguish will become worn away;<br />
					you do not know the getting rid<br />
					of unskilled states of mind here and now,<br />
					or the arising of skilled states.</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so,<br />
					it would not be suitable<br />
					that the reverend Jains should explain,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever this individual experiences,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<br />

					<p class="f4">From there being no overflowing into the future<br />

					from the destruction of deeds<br />

					from the destruction of anguish<br />

					from the destruction of feeling<br />

					<p class="f4">But if you, reverend Jains, were to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We ourselves were in the past,<br />

					if you were to know:<br />
					"We ourselves did this evil deed in the past,<br />

					all anguish will become worn away";<br />
					if you were to know<br />
					the getting rid of unskilled states of mind<br />
					here and now,<br />

					this being so,<br />
					it would be suitable<br />

					<p class="f4">Reverend Jains,<br />
					it is as if a man were pierced by an arrow<br />
					that was thickly smeared with poison.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And because he has felt the arrow<br />
					he might experience a feeling<br />
					that was painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">His <a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> friends and acquaintances,<br />
					kith and kin<br />
					might procure a physician and surgeon.</p>

					<p class="f4">That physician and surgeon<br />
					might cut round the opening of his wound with a knife,<br />
					but on account of cutting round the opening of the wound with the knife<br />
					the man might experience a feeling that was painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">That physician and surgeon<br />
					might probe him for the arrow<br />
					with a (surgeon's) probe,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but on account of his being probed for the arrow<br />
					with the (surgeon's) probe<br />
					he might also experience a feeling that was painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">That physician and surgeon<br />
					might extract the arrow from him,<br />
					but on account of having the arrow extracted<br />
					he might also experience a feeling that was painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">The physician and surgeon<br />
					might dress the opening of his wound<br />
					with medicated powder,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but on account of having the opening of the wound<br />

					he might also experience a feeling that was painful,<br />

					<p class="f4">After a time<br />
					when the skin had healed on the wound<br />
					he would be well,<br />
					at ease,<br />
					independent,<br />
					his own master,<br />
					going wherever he liked.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This might occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time I was pierced by an arrow<br />

					<p class="f4">And because I felt the arrow<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, reverend Jains,<br />

					<p class="f4">"We ourselves were in the past,<br />

					if you were to know:<br />
					"We ourselves did this evil deed in the past,<br />

					"So much anguish is worn away,<br />

					all anguish will become worn away";<br />
					if you were to know<br />

					<p class="f4">'But as you, reverend Jains, do not know:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We ourselves were in the past,<br />

					if you were to know:<br />
					"We ourselves did this evil deed in the past,<br />

					if you were to know:<br />
					"So much anguish is worn away,<br />
					or so much anguish is to be worn away,<br />
					or when so much anguish is worn away,<br />
					all anguish will become worn away";<br />
					if you were to know<br />
					the getting rid of unskilled states of mind<br />
					here and now,<br />

					therefore it would not be suitable<br />
					that the reverend Jains should explain,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever this individual experiences,<br />

					or neither painful nor pleasant,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<br />

					from the destruction of anguish<br />

					from the destruction of feeling<br />
					all anguish will become worn away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, monks,<br />
					these Jains spoke to me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverence, Nāṭaputta the Jain<br />
					is all-knowing,<br />
					all-seeing;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep<br />
					or awake,<br />
					knowledge-and-vision is permanently<br />
					and continuously before me."</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there is, reverend Jains,<br />
					an evil deed that was formerly done by you,<br />
					wear it away by this severe austerity.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the non-doing<br />
					of an evil deed in the future<br />
					is from control of body,<br />
					control of speech,<br />
					control of thought<br />
					here, now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<br />
					by making an end<br />
					of ancient deeds,<br />
					by the non-doing of new deeds,<br />
					there is no overflowing into the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">From there being no overflowing into the future<br />
					comes the destruction of deeds;<br />
					from the destruction of deeds<br />
					comes the destruction of anguish;<br />
					from the destruction of anguish<br />
					comes the destruction of feeling;<br />
					from the destruction of feeling<br />
					all anguish will become worn away."</p>

					<p class="f4">And because that is approved of by us<br />
					as well as being pleasing to us,<br />
					therefore we are delighted.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said<br />
					I, monks, spoke thus to those Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These five conditions here-now, reverend Jains,<br />
					have a twofold result.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Faith,<br />
					inclination,<br />
					tradition,<br />
					consideration of reasons,<br />
					reflection on and approval of some view.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, reverend Jains,<br />
					are five conditions here-now<br />
					that have a twofold result.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this,<br />
					what was the faith<br />
					that in the past<br />
					the reverend Jains had in a teacher,<br />
					what was their inclination,<br />
					what the tradition,<br />
					what the <a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> consideration of reasons,<br />
					what the reflection on<br />
					and approval of some view?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monks, speaking thus,<br />
					beheld no reasoned response<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					among the Jains.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, monks, I spoke to these Jains thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, reverend Jains?</p>

					<p class="f4">At a time when there is severe effort for you,<br />
					severe striving,<br />
					do you at that time<br />
					experience a feeling that is severe,<br />
					acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp?</p>

					<p class="f4">But at a time when there is no severe effort for you,<br />
					no severe striving,<br />
					do you at that time<br />
					experience a feeling that is not severe<br />
					acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend Gotama, at a time when there is severe effort for us<br />
					severe striving,<br />
					at that time<br />
					we experience a feeling that is severe,<br />
					acute,<br />

					sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">But at a time when there is no severe effort for us,<br />
					no severe striving,<br />
					at that time we do not experience a feeling<br />
					that is severe,<br />
					acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp.</p>

					<p class="f4">'So really it is, reverend Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">At a time when there is severe effort for you,<br />
					severe striving,<br />
					you at that time<br />
					experience a feeling that is severe,<br />
					acute,<br />

					<p class="f4">But at a time when there is no severe effort for you,<br />
					no severe striving,<br />
					you at that time<br />
					you do not experience a feeling<br />
					that is severe<br />
					acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					severe,<br />
					sharp.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so,<br />
					it would be suitable<br />
					that the reverend Jains should explain,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever this individual experiences,<br />
					whether pleasant<br />
					or painful<br />
					or neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					all is due to what was previously done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If, reverend Jains, at a time<br />
					when there is severe effort for you,<br />
					severe striving,<br />
					at that very time<br />
					there might be a feeling that is acute,<br />

					severe,<br />
					sharp;<br />
					but at the time<br />
					when there is no severe effort for you,<br />
					no severe striving,<br />
					at that very time<br />
					there might (also) be a feeling that is acute,<br />

					this being so,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch reverend Jains,<br />
