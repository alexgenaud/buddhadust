					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in the Jeta Grove in Anathapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Moliyaphagguna lived too closely<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> associated with the nuns.</p>

					<p class="f4">While the venerable Moliyaphagguna was living associated thus with the nuns,<br />
					if any monk face to face with the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					spoke dispraise of those nuns,<br />
					then the venerable Moliyaphagguna was angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					and made a legal question.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And if some monk face to face with those nuns<br />
					spoke dispraise of the venerable Moliyaphagguna,<br />
					then those nuns were angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					and made a legal question.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was in this way that the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					was living associated with nuns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					this monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					lives too closely associated with nuns.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Lord, that the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					lives associated with the nuns:</p>

					<p class="f4">If any monk face to face with the venerable Moliyaphagguna,<br />
					speaks in dispraise of the nuns<br />
					the venerable Moliyaphagguna is angry,<br />
					displeased<br />
					and makes a legal question;<br />
					or if some monk,<br />
					face to face with the nuns,<br />
					speaks dispraise of the venerable Moliyaphagguna,<br />
					these nuns are angry,<br />
					displeased<br />
					and make a legal question.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Lord, that the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					lives associated with nuns."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed this monk, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come [123] you, monk,<br />
					summon the monk Moliyaphagguna on my behalf, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is summoning you, Phagguna.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Lord,"<br />
					and this monk, having answered the Lord in assent,<br />
					approached the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Moliyaphagguna:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord is summoning you, Phagguna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, your reverence,"<br />
					and the venerable Moliyaphagguna, <a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a><br />
					having answered this monk in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to the venerable Moliyaphagguna<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as is said,<br />
					that you, Phagguna,<br />
					are living too closely associated with nuns?</p>

					<p class="f4">So that if some monk,<br />
					face to face with you,<br />
					speaks in dispraise of the nuns<br />
					you are angry,<br />
					displeased<br />
					and make a legal question;<br />
					or if some monk,<br />
					face to face with the nuns,<br />
					speaks dispraise of you,<br />
					these nuns are angry,<br />
					displeased<br />
					and make a legal question?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it true, as is said,<br />
					that you, Phagguna<br />
					are living associated with the nuns thus?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But did not you, Phagguna,<br />
					the son of a respectable family,<br />
					go forth from home into homelessness out of faith?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But this is not suitable in you, Phagguna,<br />
					a son of a respectable family<br />
					who has gone forth from home into homelessness out of faith,<br />
					that you should live too closely associated with nuns.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Phagguna,<br />
					even if anyone face to face with you<br />
					should speak dispraise of those nuns,<br />
					even so should you, Phagguna,<br />
					get rid of those which are worldly desires,<br />
					those which are worldly thoughts;<br />
					and you, Phagguna,<br />
					should train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither will my mind become perverted,<br />
					nor will I utter an evil speech,<br />
					but kindly and compassionate will I dwell<br />
					with a mind of friendliness and void of hatred.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that you must train youself, Phagguna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Phagguna,<br />
					even if anyone face to face with you<br />
					should give a blow with the hand<br />
					to these nuns,<br />
					should give a blow with a clod of earth,<br />
					should give a blow with a stick,<br />
					should give a blow with a weapon,<br />
					even then, Phagguna,<br />
					should you train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither will my mind become perverted,<br />
					nor will I utter an evil speech,<br />
					but kindly and compassionate will I dwell<br />
					with a mind of friendliness and void of hatred.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that you must train youself, Phagguna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Phagguna,<br />
					even if anyone face to face with you<br />
					should speak dispraise of those nuns,<br />
					even so should you, Phagguna,<br />
					get rid of those which are worldly desires,<br />
					those which are worldly thoughts;<br />
					and you, Phagguna,<br />
					should train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither will my mind become perverted,<br />
					nor will I utter an evil speech,<br />
					but kindly and compassionate will I dwell<br />
					with a mind of friendliness and void of hatred.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that you must train youself, Phagguna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Phagguna,<br />
					even if anyone face to face with you<br />
					should give a blow with the hand<br />
					to these nuns,<br />
					should give a blow with a clod of earth,<br />
					should give a blow with a stick,<br />
					should give a blow with a weapon,<br />
					even then, Phagguna,<br />
					should you train yourself thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither will my mind become perverted,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is thus that you must train youself, Phagguna.</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></a> Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, my monks at one time<br />
					were indeed accomplished in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks, addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now I, monks, partake of a meal at one session.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Partaking of a meal at one session,<br />
					I, monks, am aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Come you too, monks,<br />
					partake of a meal at one session;<br />
					partaking of a meal at one session<br />
					you too, monks, will be aware of good health<br />
					and of being without illness<br />
					and of buoyancy and strength<br />
					and living in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There was nothing to be done by me, monks,<br />
					by way of instruction to those monks;<br />
					all that was to be done by me, monks,<br />
					was the production of mindfulness among those monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, even as<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> on level ground<br />
					at crossroads<br />
					a chariot is standing harnessed with thoroughbreds,<br />
					the goad hanging handy;<br />
					and a skilled groom,<br />
					a charioteer of horses to be tamed,<br />
					having mounted it,<br />
					having taken the reins in his left hand,<br />
					having taken the goad in his right,<br />
					might drive up and down<br />
					where and how he likes;<br />
					even so, monks, there was nothing to be done by me<br />
					by way of instruction to those monks;<br />
					all that was to be done by me, monks,<br />
					was the production of mindfulness among those monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, do you get rid of what is unskilled,<br />
					make exertion<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> among things that are skilled -<br />
					so will you too come to growth,<br />
					development,<br />
					maturity in this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, close to some village or little town,<br />
					a great sal-wood may be overgrown with creepers,<br />
					but some man might approach it<br />
					desiring its good,<br />
					desiring its welfare,<br />
					desiring its security from bonds;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he, having cut off those sal-tree sprouts<br />
					which are bent and crushed by the strength (of the creepers),<br />
					would carry them out (of the wood)<br />
					and would thoroughly clear the inside of the wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he would tend properly<br />
					those sal-tree sprouts<br />
					which are straight and well grown.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, after a time<br />
					this sal-tree wood<br />
					would come to growth,<br />
					development,<br />
					maturity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, do you, monks,<br />
					get rid of what is unskilled,<br />
					make exertion among things that are skilled, -<br />
					so will you too come to growth,<br />
					development,<br />
					maturity<br />
					in this <i>dhamma</i> and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks,<br />
					in this very Sāvatthī,<br />
					there was a lady <a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> householder named Vedehikā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a lovely reputation had gone forth thus<br />
					about the lady Vedehikā:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The lady householder Vedehikā is gentle,<br />
					she is meek,<br />
					she is tranquil."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the lady householder Vedehikā<br />
					had a slave woman, named Kāḷī,<br />
					who was clever,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					diligent,<br />
					a careful worker.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, it occurred to the slave woman Kāḷī:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A lovely reputation has gone forth about my mistress thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The lady householder Vedehikā is gentle,<br />
					she is meek,<br />
					she is tranquil."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now does my mistress have an inward ill-temper<br />
					that she does not show,<br />
					or does she not have one?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or is it that my mistress,<br />
					because I do my work so carefully,<br />
					whether she has an inward ill-temper or not,<br />
					does not show it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should test the mistress?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the slave woman Kāḷī<br />
					got up late next day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the lady householder Vedehikā<br />
					spoke thus to the slave woman Kāḷī:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well now,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> Kāḷī.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is it, mistress?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now why did you get up late today?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's nothing, mistress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's nothing indeed, bad slave -<br />
					you got up late today,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					and angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					she frowned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, it occurred to the woman slave Kāḷī:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether my mistress has an inward ill-temper or not,<br />
					she does not show it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it because my work is so careful<br />
					that my mistress,<br />
					whether she has an inward ill-temper or not,<br />
					does not show it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to test the mistress even further?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, monks, the woman slave Kāḷī<br />
					got up later the next day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the lady householder Vedehikā<br />
					spoke thus to the slave woman Kāḷī:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well now, Kāḷī.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is it, mistress?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now why did you get up late today?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's nothing, mistress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's nothing indeed, bad slave -<br />
					you got up late today,'<br />
					and angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					she spoke a word of displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the slave woman Kāḷī:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether my mistress has an inward ill-temper or not,<br />
					she does not show it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it because my work is so careful<br />
					that my mistress,<br />
					whether she has an inward ill-temper or not,<br />
					does not show it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to test the mistress even further?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the slave woman Kāḷī got <a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> up even later the next day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the lady householder Vedehikā<br />
					spoke thus to the slave-woman Kāḷī:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well now, Kāḷī'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is it, mistress?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now why did you get up late today?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's nothing, mistress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's nothing indeed, bad slave -<br />
					you got up late today,'<br />
					and angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					having seized the pin for securing the bolt (of a door)<br />
					she gave her a blow on the head,<br />
					which cracked her head.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the slave woman Kāḷī,<br />
					her head broken and streaming with blood,<br />
					spread it about among the neighbours, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'See, sirs, the deed of the gentle one;<br />
					see, sirs, the deed of the meek one;<br />
					see, sire, the deed of the tranquil one.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can she,<br />
					saying to her only slave woman,<br />
					'You got up late today,'<br />
					angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					having seized the pin for securing the bolt (of a door),<br />
					give a blow on the head and crack the head?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then, monks,<br />
					after a time<br />
					an evil reputation went forth<br />
					about this lady householder Vedehikā:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The lady householder Vedehikā is violent,<br />
					she is not meek,<br />
					she is not tranquil."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, some monk here is very gentle,<br />
					very meek,<br />
					very tranquil<br />
					so long as disagreeable ways of speech<br />
					do not assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when disagreeable ways of speech assail the monk<br />
					it is then that he is to be called gentle,<br />
					is to be called meek,<br />
					is to be called tranquil.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monks, do not call that monk easy to speak to<br />
					who is easy to speak to about robe-material,<br />
					almsfood,<br />
					lodgings,<br />
					medicines for the sick,<br />
					who falls into suavity.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, monks, that this monk,<br />
					not getting robe-material,<br />
					almsfood,<br />
					lodgings,<br />
					medicines for the sick,<br />
					is not easy to speak to,<br />
					does not fall into suavity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, whatever monk, respecting only <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					revering <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					honouring <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					comes to be easy to speak to,<br />
					falls into suavity -<br />
					him do I call easy to speak to.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">Respecting only <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					revering <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					honouring <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					we will become easy to speak to,<br />
					we will fall into suavity,<br />
					thus must you train yourselves, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, monks,<br />
					these five ways of speaking<br />
					in which others<br />
					when speaking to you<br />
					might speak:</p>

					<p class="f4">At a right time<br />
					or at a wrong time;<br />
					according to fact<br />
					or not according to fact;<br />
					gently<br />
					or harshly;<br />
					on what is connected with the goal<br />
					or on what is not connected with the goal;<br />
					with a mind of friendliness<br />
					or full of hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when speaking to others<br />
					you might speak at a right time<br />
					or at a wrong time;<br />
					monks, when speaking to others<br />
					you might speak according to fact<br />
					or not according to fact<br />
					monks, when speaking to <a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> others<br />
					you might speak gently<br />
					or harshly;<br />
					monks, when speaking to others<br />
					you might speak about what is connected with the goal<br />
					or about what is not connected with the goal;<br />
					monks, when speaking to others<br />
					you might speak with minds of friendliness<br />
					or full of hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, you should train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither will our minds become perverted<br />
					nor will we utter an evil speech,<br />
					but kindly and compassionate will we dwell,<br />
					with a mind of friendliness,<br />
					void of hatred;<br />
					and we will dwell having suffused that person<br />
					with a mind of friendliness;<br />
					and, beginning with him,<br />
					we will dwell having suffused the whole world<br />
					with a mind of friendliness that is far-reaching,<br />
					widespread,<br />
					immeasurable,<br />
					without enmity,<br />
					without malevolence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you must train yourselves, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, as a man might come along<br />
					bringing a shovel and basket,<br />
					and might speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will make this great earth not earth';<br />
					so he digs here and there,<br />
					tosses it here and there,<br />
					spits here and there,<br />
					stales here and there, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are becoming not-earth,<br />
					you are becoming not-earth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that man<br />
					make this great earth not earth?</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that this great earth, Lord,<br />
					is deep,<br />
					it is immeasurable,<br />
					it is not easy to make it not-earth<br />
					before that man would be worn out and defeated."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, monks, are these five ways of speaking<br />
					in which others when speaking to you might speak:</p>

					<p class="f4">At a right time<br />
