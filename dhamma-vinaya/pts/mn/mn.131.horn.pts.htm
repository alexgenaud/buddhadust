					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This title is hard to translate. <i>MA.</i> v. 1 connects the word <i>bhaddekaratta</i> with being endowed with intentness on <i>vipassanā,</i> insight gained in meditation.	See Intr., p. xxvi. This is the Vagga that has 12 Discourses. If it were thought desirable to reduce them to the normal 10, this Discourse, spoken by the Lord, would rank as one, and the next three, spoken by disciples, would have to be counted together as another single Discourse.</p>

					The meaning of <i>anvāgameti</i> appears to be to cause to come back, <i>i.e.</i> to recall, because of craving and wrong view.</p>
