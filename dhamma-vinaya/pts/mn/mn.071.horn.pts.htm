					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Great Grove in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Vacchagotta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was living in Ekapuṇḍarīka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the wanderers' park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Vesālī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is still too early<br />
					to walk for almsfood in Vesālī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to approach Ekapuṇḍarīka, the wanderers' park,<br />
					and Vacchagotta the wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord approached Ekapuṇḍarīka, the wanderers' park,<br />
					and Vacchagotta the wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Vacchagotta saw the Lord coming in the distance<br />
					and seeing him,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord come;<br />
					revered sir, there is a welcome for the Lord;<br />
					revered sir, it is long since the Lord made the opportunity to come here;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord sit down,<br />
					this is the appointed seat."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down on the appointed seat,<br />
					and Vacchagotta the wanderer,<br />
					<a id="pt482" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg482"><span class="f2">[482]</span></a>having taken a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the wanderer Vacchagotta spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, I have heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is all knowing,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					all seeing;<br />
					he claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep<br />
					or awake,<br />
					knowledge-and-vision is permanently<br />
					and continuously before me."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, those who speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is all knowing,<br />
					all seeing;<br />
					he claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a> "Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep<br />

					knowledge-and-vision is permanently<br />
					and continuously before me."' -</p>

					<p class="f4">revered sir, I hope that these<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> are speaking of the Lord<br />
					in accordance with what has been said<br />
					and are not misrepresenting the Lord<br />
					with what is not fact,<br />
					but are explaining in accordance with dhamma,<br />
					and that no one of his fellow <i>dhamma</i>-men,<br />
					of this way of speaking,<br />
					gives grounds for reproach?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vaceha, those who speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is all knowing,<br />
					all seeing;<br />
					he claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep<br />
					or awake,<br />
					knowledge-and-vision is permanently<br />
					and continuously before me."' -</p>

					<p class="f4">these are not speaking of me<br />
					in accordance with what has been said,<br />
					but they are misrepresenting me<br />
					with what is untrue,<br />
					not fact."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Expounding in what way, revered sir,<br />
					would we be speaking<br />
					in accordance with what has been said,<br />
					and would not be misrepresenting the Lord<br />
					with what is not fact,<br />
					but would be explaining in accordance with <i>dhamma</i><br />
					so that no fellow dhamma-man,<br />
					of the same way of speaking,<br />
					could give grounds for reproach?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vaccha, expounding:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is a threefold-knowledge man,'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt483" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg483"><span class="f2">[483]</span></a>you would be one<br />
					who speaks in accordance with what has been said by me,<br />
					you would not be misrepresenting me<br />
					with what is not fact,<br />
					you would be explaining in accordance with <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					and no fellow <i>dhamma</i>-man<br />
					of this way of speaking<br />
					could give grounds for reproach.</p>

					<p class="f4">For I, Vaccha,<br />
					whenever I please<br />
					recollect a variety of former habitations,<br />
					that is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so I was nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where I was such a one by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so I was nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I recollect divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, Vaccha, whenever I please,<br />
					with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men,<br />
					see beings as they pass hence<br />
					or come to be;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />
					according to the consequences of deeds,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified <i>deva</i>-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					I see beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					I comprehends that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, Vaccha, by the destruction of the cankers,<br />
					having realised here and now<br />
					by my own super-knowledge<br />
					the freedom of mind<br />
					and the freedom through wisdom<br />
					that are cankerless,<br />
					entering thereon,<br />
					abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vaccha, expounding<br />
					that the recluse Gotama is a threefold-knowledge man,<br />
					you would be one who speaks in accordance<br />
					with what has been said by me,<br />
					you would not be misrepresenting me<br />
					with what is not fact,<br />
					you would be explaining in accordance with dhamma,<br />
					and no <a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></a> fellow <i>dhamma</i>-man<br />
					of this way of speaking<br />
					could give grounds for reproach."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Vacchagotta the wanderer spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, is there any householder who,<br />
					not getting rid of the householder's fetter(s),<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					is an end-maker of ill?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is not any householder, Vaccha, who,<br />
					not getting rid of the householder's fetter(s),<br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					is an end-maker of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is there, good Gotama,<br />
					any householder who,<br />
					not getting rid of the householder's fetter(s),<br />
					at the breaking up of the body attains heaven?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not just one hundred, Vaccha,<br />
					nor two hundred,<br />
					nor three,<br />
					four<br />
					or five hundred,<br />
					but far more are those householders who,<br />
					not getting-rid of the householder's fetter(s),<br />
					at the breaking up of the body attain heaven."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, good Gotama,<br />
					is there any Naked Ascetic who<br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					is an end-maker of ill?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is not, Vaccha,<br />
					any Naked Ascetic who<br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					is an end-maker of ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is there then, good Gotama,<br />
					any Naked Ascetic who<br />
					at the breaking up of the body<br />
					attained heaven?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Although I, Vaccha,<br />
					recollect ninety-one eons,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I do not know of any Naked Ascetic<br />
					who attained heaven,<br />
					except one;<br />
					and he professed <i>kamma,</i><br />
					he professed operative <i>kamma.</i>"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> "This being so, good Gotama,<br />
					that fold of the sects<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is empty even in regard to attaining heaven."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This being so, Vaccha,<br />
					that fold of the sects<br />
					is empty even in regard to attaining heaven."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, the wanderer Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
