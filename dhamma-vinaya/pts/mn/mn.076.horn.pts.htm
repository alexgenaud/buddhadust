					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a> in Ghosita's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was staying in the Fig Tree<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Cave<br />
					with a great company of wanderers,<br />
					with at least five hundred wanderers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					emerging from solitude towards evening,<br />
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, your reverences,<br />
					we will go to Devakaṭa Pool so as to see the Cave."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence," these monks answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					together with many monks,<br />
					approached Devakata Pool.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was sitting down<br />
					with the great company of wanderers<br />
					shouting out with a loud noise,<br />
					a great noise,<br />
					talking various kinds of inferior talk,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">talk on kings,<br />
					thieves,<br />
					great ministers,<br />
					armies,<br />
					fears,<br />
					battles,<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					scents,<br />
					relations,<br />
					vehicles,<br />
					villages,<br />
					market towns,<br />
					towns,<br />
					the country,<br />
					women,<br />
					heroes,<br />
					streets,<br />
					wells,<br />
					those departed before,<br />
					talk of diversity,<br />
					speculation about the world,<br />
					speculation about the sea,<br />
					<a id="pt514" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg514"><span class="f2">[514]</span></a>talk about becoming or not becoming<br />
					thus or thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sandaka saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him, he called his own company to order,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sirs, let there be little noise;<br />
					do not, good sirs, make a noise;<br />
					this is a disciple of the recluse Gotama who is coming -<br />
					the recluse Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">For as long as disciples of the recluse Gotama<br />
					have <a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> been staying near Kosambī<br />
					the recluse Ānanda has been among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">These venerable ones wish for little noise,<br />
					they are trained to little noise,<br />
					they are praisers of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he may consider approaching<br />
					if he knows that this is a company of little noise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda approached the wanderer Sandaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderer Sandaka spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the revered Ānanda come,<br />
					there is a welcome for the revered Ānanda;<br />
					it is long since the revered Ānanda made this opportunity,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is to say<br />
					for coming here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the revered Ānanda sit down,<br />
					this seat is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda sat down on the seat that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the wanderer Sandaka,<br />
					having taken a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus<br />
					to the wanderer Sandaka<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the talk<br />
					for which you are now gathered together here, Sandaka?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what was your talk<br />
					that was interrupted?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Let be that talk, good Ānanda,<br />
					for which we are now gathered together here.</p>

					<p class="f4">It will not be difficult for the good Ānanda<br />
					to hear this talk later.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good if some dhamma-talk<br />
					belonging to his own teacher<br />
					were to occur to the revered Ānanda himself."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Sandaka, listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," the wanderer Sandaka answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sandaka, these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring<br />
					have been pointed out<br />
					by this Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One;<br />
					and four comfortless Brahma-farings<br />
					have been pointed out<br />
					in which an intelligent man<br />
					could certainly not live a Brahma-faring,<br />
					or, if living it,<br />
					could not gain success in the right path,<br />
					in dhamma,<br />
					in what is skilled."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, good Ānanda,<br />
					are these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring<br />
					that have been pointed out<br />
					by the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					perfected one,<br />

					in which <a id="pt515" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg515"><span class="f2">[515]</span></a>an intelligent man<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Sandaka,<br />

					there is not this world,<br />
					there is not a world beyond;<br />

					proceeding rightly,<br />
					and who proclaim this world<br />
					and a world beyond,<br />
					having realized them<br />
					by their own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">This man is derived<br />
					from the four great elements<br />
					so that, when he passes away,<br />
					the earthy part of his body<br />
					returns and relapses to earth,<br />
					the fluid part to water,<br />
					the hot part to heat,<br />
					the windy part to wind,<br />
					and his sense-organs pass over into the ether.</p>

					<p class="f4">Four men,<br />
					with a bier as the fifth,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">It is imbeciles who speak of giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Sandaka, a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br />
