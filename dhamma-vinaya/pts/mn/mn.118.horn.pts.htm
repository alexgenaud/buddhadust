					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Eastern Monastery<br />
					in the palace of Migāra's mother,<br />
					together with a number of well known elders and disciples:<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					the Venerable Kassapa the Great,<br />

					and with other well known elders and disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time<br />
					the monks who were elders<br />
					exhorted and instructed newly ordained monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some monks who were elders<br />
					exhorted and instructed ten monks,<br />
					and some monks who were elders<br />
					exhorted and instructed twenty monks,<br />
					and some monks who were elders<br />
					exhorted and instructed thirty monks,<br />
					and some monks who were elders<br />
					exhorted and instructed forty monks.</p>

					I am satisfied in mind, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore do you, monks,<br />
