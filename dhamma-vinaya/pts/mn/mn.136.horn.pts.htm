					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels' feeding place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Samiddhi<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was staying in a little forest hut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Potali's son,<br />
					who was always pacing up and down,<br />
					always roaming about on foot,<br />
					approached the venerable Samiddhi;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Samiddhi,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the wanderer Potali's son<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Samiddhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Samiddhi,<br />
					from the recluse Gotama's own mouth<br />
					have I heard,<br />
					from his own mouth<br />
					have I learnt<br />
					that deed of body is foolish,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					deed of speech is foolish,<br />
					only deed of mind is truth;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and that there is that attainment<br />
					on attaining which<br />
					one experiences nothing."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, friend Potali's son,<br />
					speak thus;<br />
					do not, friend Potali's son,<br />
					speak thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not misrepresent the Lord;<br />
					for neither is misrepresentation of the Lord good<br />
					nor would the Lord speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Deed of body is foolish,<br />
					deed of speech is foolish,<br />
					only deed of mind is truth;<br />
					and that there is that attainment<br />
					on attaining which<br />
					one experiences nothing.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How long have you been gone forth, reverend Samiddhi?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not long, friend, three years."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg255"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span></a> "Now, why should we speak to monks who are Elders<br />
					when even a newly ordained monk<br />
					thinks that the Teacher should be defended thus?</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend Samiddhi,<br />
					when one has intentionally done a deed<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought,<br />
					what does one experience?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When one has intentionally done a deed<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought,<br />
					friend Potali's son,<br />
					one experiences anguish."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Potali's son,<br />
					neither rejoicing in<br />
					nor protesting against<br />
					what the venerable Samiddhi had said,<br />
					rose from his seat and departed<br />
					without rejoicing,<br />
					without protesting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after the wanderer Potali's son had departed,<br />
					the venerable Samiddhi approached the venerable Ānanda;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Samiddhi told the venerable Ānanda<br />
					the whole of the conversation he had had with the wanderer Potali's son<br />
					as far as it had gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Samiddhi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, reverend Samiddhi,<br />
					is a subject of conversation<br />
					that should be told to the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wait, reverend Samiddhi,<br />
					until we can approach the Lord;<br />
					when we have approached the Lord<br />
					we should tell him this matter;<br />
					as the Lord explains it to us,<br />
					so should we remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					the venerable Samiddhi answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and the venerable Samiddhi<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda<br />
					told the Lord<br />
					the whole of the conversation the venerable Samiddhi had had<br />
					with the wanderer Potali's son<br />
					as far as it had gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, Ānanda,<br />
					do not even recognise the wanderer Potali's son's premise,<br />
					how then (can I recognise) a conversation like this?</p>

					<p class="f4">The question of the wanderer Potali's son<br />
					was given a one-sided answer<br />
					by the foolish man Samiddhi<br />
					(although) it needed a discriminating explanation."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said<br />
					the venerable Udāyin<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if this, revered sir,<br />
					were the meaning of what the <a id="pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> venerable Samiddhi said,<br />
					(then) whatever one experiences is anguish."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Ānanda, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, do you, Ānanda, see<br />
					this foolish man Udāyin's (wrong) approach?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I, Ānanda, knew that this foolish man Udāyin,<br />
					opening up (this question) now,<br />
					would open it up to no purpose.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the wanderer Potali's son<br />
					really asked about the three feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">If,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda, this foolish man Samiddhi<br />
					had explained thus<br />
					when he was questioned thus<br />
					by the wanderer Potali's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, friend Potali's son,<br />
					one has intentionally done a deed<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought<br />
					for experiencing pleasure<br />
					he experiences pleasure;</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, friend Potali's son,<br />
					one has intentionally done a deed<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought<br />
					for experiencing pain<br />
					he experiences pain;</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, friend Potali's son,<br />
					one has intentionally done a deed<br />
					by body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought<br />
					for experiencing neither pain nor pleasure<br />
					he experiences neither pain nor pleasure;'</p>

					<p class="f4">explaining thus, Ānanda,<br />
					the foolish man Samiddhi<br />
					would have explained properly<br />
					to the wanderer Potali's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">And moreover, Ānanda,<br />
					there are foolish and inexperienced wanderers<br />
					who are members of other sects<br />
					who would find out about the Tathāāgata's<br />
					great analysis of deeds<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					if you, Ānanda, would listen<br />
					while the Tathāgata is classifying<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the great analysis of deeds."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is the time for this, Lord,<br />
					it is the time for this, Well-farer,<br />
					that the Lord should classify<br />
					the great analysis of deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the monks have heard the Lord,<br />
					they will remember."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Ānanda,<br />
					listen,<br />
					attend carefully,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg257"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span></a> "Yes, revered sir,"<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>
