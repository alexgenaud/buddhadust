					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the Lord <a id="pt463" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg463"><span class="f2">[463]</span></a> was sitting in the open<br />
					surrounded by an Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks<br />
					concerning these young men of family,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those young men of family, monks,<br />
					who have gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness through faith in me -<br />
					I hope, monks,<br />
					that these monks are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br />
					these monks became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Lord addressed the monks<br />
					concerning these young men of family,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those young men of family, monks,<br />
					who have gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness through faith in me -<br />
					I hope, monks,<br />
					that these monks are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time<br />
					when he had spoken thus,<br />
					these monks became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Lord addressed the monks<br />
					concerning these young men of family,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those young men of family, monks,<br />
					who have gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness through faith in me -<br />
					I hope, monks,<br />
					that these monks are finding delight in the Brahma-faring?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time<br />
					when he had spoken thus,<br />
					these monks became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time these monks became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, suppose that I were to question<br />
					these young men of family themselves?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the venerable Anuruddha,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope that you, Anuruddhas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"It is good, it is good, Anuruddhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is fitting in you, Anuruddhas,<br />
					who are young men of family<br />
					gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness through faith,<br />
					that you should find delight in the Brahma-faring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet while you, Anuruddhas,<br />
					possessed of radiant youth,<br />
					in the prime of your lives,<br />
					with coal-black hair,<br />
					might be enjoying the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					you, Anuruddhas,<br />
					although possessed of radiant youth,<br />
					in the prime of your lives,<br />
					with coal-black hair,<br />
					have nevertheless gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But you, Aimruddhas,<br />
					are neither those that have gone forth<br />
					from home into homelessness<br />
					on the suggestion of kings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					nor are you those who have gone forth<br />
					from home into homelessness<br />
					on the suggestion of thieves<br />
					nor are you those who have gone forth<br />

					because of debt<br />
					nor are you those who have gone forth<br />
					from home into homelessness<br />
					through fear,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					nor are you those who have gone forth<br />
					from home into homelessness<br />
					because of having lost the means of livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet was it not with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Although I am oppressed by birth,<br />
					ageing,<br />
					dying,<br />
					by grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					oppressed by anguish,<br />
					overcome by anguish,<br />
					yet perhaps some ending<br />
					of this whole mass of anguish<br />
					may be seen,'</p>

					<p class="f4">that you, Anuruddhas, have gone forth from home into homelessness through faith?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And when, Anuruddhas,<br />
					a young man of family has gone forth thus,<br />
					what is there to be done by him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Anuruddhas,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even, Anuruddhas, as a palm-tree<br />
