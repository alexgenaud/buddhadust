					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta Grovevin Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk here declares profound knowledge,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is <a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the words of this monk<br />
					are to be neither rejoiced in<br />
					nor protested against.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Without (your) rejoicing or protesting,<br />
					the question might be asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence,<br />
					these four modes of statement<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					have been rightly pointed out<br />
					by that Lord who knows and sees<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which when seen<br />
					is spoken of as seen,<br />
					that which when heard<br />
					is spoken of as heard,<br />
					that which when sensed<br />
					is spoken of as sensed,<br />
					that which when cognised<br />
					is spoken of as cognised.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverence,<br />
					these four modes of statement<br />

					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But knowing what,<br />
					seeing what<br />
					in respect of these four modes of statement<br />
					can your reverence say<br />
					that his mind is freed from the cankers<br />
					with no grasping (remaining)?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the explanation of the monk<br />
					in whom the cankers are destroyed,<br />
					who has lived the life,<br />
					done what was to be done,<br />
					laid down the burden,<br />
					attained his own welfare,<br />
					in whom the fetters of becoming<br />
					are utterly destroyed<br />
					and who is freed<br />
					by right profound knowledge,<br />
					would be in accordance with <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					were he to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">'I, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, that monk's words<br />

					<p class="f4">Whether I was setting out<br />

					<p class="f4">Possessed of this ariyan body of moral habit and<br />

					I chose a remote lodging in a forest,<br />

					on a mountain slope,<br />
					in a wilderness,<br />
					a hill-cave,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />
					a forest haunt,<br />

					<p class="f4">Returning from alms-gathering<br />

					I sat down cross-legged,<br />

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of covetousness for the world,<br />
					I dwelt with a mind devoid of coveting,<br />

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of the taint of ill-will,<br />

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of sloth and torpor,<br />
					I dwelt devoid of sloth and torpor;<br />

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of restlessness and worry,<br />
					I dwelt calmly,<br />
					<a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> the mind subjectively tranqilised,<br />
					I purified the mind of restlesssness and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of doubt,<br />
					I dwelt doubt-crossed,<br />

					I purified the mind of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of these five hindrances —<br />
					defilements of the mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom —<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					I entered on and abided in the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br />
					I dwelt with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiencing in my person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					I entered on<br />

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of joy<br />

					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					stable,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge of<br />
					the destruction of the cankers.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">When I knew and saw this thus,<br />
					my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of the sense-pleasures and<br />
					my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of becoming and<br />
					my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom<br />
					the knowledge came to be that<br />
					I was freed and<br />
					I comprehended:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, your reverences,<br />

					see thus,<br />
					in respect of this consciousness-informed body<br />
					and all external phenomena,<br />
					I can say that my tendency to pride that<br />
					"I am the doer,<br />
					mine is the doer"<br />
					has been properly extirpated.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that monk's words<br />
					should be rejoiced in<br />
					and approved of<br />
					by the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is good.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they have rejoiced in<br />
					and approved of his words,<br />

					he should be informed thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is a gain for you, your reverence,<br />
					it is well gotten by you, your reverence,<br />
					that we see a Brahma-farer<br />
					in one such as is the venerable one.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
