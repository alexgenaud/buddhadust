					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī,<br />
					returning from the alms-gathering after the meal,<br />
					he approached the palace of Migāra's mother<br />
					and the Eastern <a id="pg297"><span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span></a> monastery<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time King Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					having mounted the bull-elephant Ekapuṇḍarika<br />
					(One-Lotus),<br />
					set forth from Sāvatthī<br />
					in the early morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi saw the venerable Ānanda<br />
					coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he addressed the chief minister, Sirivaḍḍha, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dear Sirivaḍḍha, is not this the venerable Ānanda?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire, this is the venerable Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi addressed another man, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, my good man,<br />
					approach the venerable Ānanda;<br />
					in my name salute the venerable Ānanda's feet with your head,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, King Pasenadi salutes the venerable Ānanda's feet with his head,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, revered sir,<br />
					there is really nothing urgent to be done<br />
					by the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					please, revered sir,<br />
					let the venerable Ānanda wait for a moment<br />
					out of compassion.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire,"<br />
					and this man having answered King Pasenadi in assent,<br />
					approached the venerable Ānanda;<br />
					having approached<br />
					and having greeted the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As this man was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir,<br />
					King Pasenadi of Kosala salutes the venerable Ānanda's feet with his head,<br />
					and speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, revered sir,<br />
					there is really nothing urgent to be done<br />
					by the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					please, revered sir,<br />
					let the venerable Ānanda wait for a moment<br />
					out of compassion.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda consented<br />
					by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi,<br />
					having gone by the bull-elephant<br />
					as far as the ground was possible for the elephant,<br />
					having dismounted,<br />
					approached the venerable Ānanda on foot;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					King Pasenadi spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, revered sir,<br />
					there is nothing urgent to be done<br />
					by the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					it were good, revered sir,<br />
					that the venerable Ānanda<br />
					should approach the bank of the river <i>Aciravatī</i><br />
					out of compassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda consented<br />
					by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br />
					approached the bank of the river Aciravatī;<br />
					 having approached,<br />
					he sat down on a seat made ready<br />
					at the root of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi,<br />
					having gone by bull-elephant<br />
					as far as the ground was possible for the elephant,<br />
					having dismounted,<br />
					approached the venerable Ānanda on foot;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					King Pasenadi spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir,<br />
					let the venerable Ānanda sit down on this elephant-rug."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg298"><span class="f2 g"><b>[298]</b></span></a> "No, sire; you sit down,<br />
					I am sitting on a seat of my own."</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi sat down on the prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As King Pasenadi was sitting down,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered Ānanda,<br />
					would the Lord engage not<br />
					in such bodily conduct<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					as was offensive to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> intelligent recluses and brahmans?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sire,<br />
					the Lord would not engage in such bodily conduct<br />
					as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, revered Ānanda,<br />
					would the Lord engage not<br />
					in such conduct of speech<br />
					as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sire,<br />
					the Lord would not engage in such conduct of speech<br />
					as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, revered Ānanda,<br />
					would the Lord engage not<br />
					in such conduct of thought<br />
					as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sire,<br />
					the Lord would not engage in such conduct of thought<br />
					as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, revered sir,<br />
					it is marvellous, revered sir -<br />
					what I was not able to convey fully in a question<br />
					has been, revered sir, fully conveyed by the venerable Ānanda<br />
					in answer to the question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, when those who are ignorant and inexperienced<br />
					speak in praise or dispraise of others<br />
					without test or scrutiny,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					we do not fall back on that<br />
					as the pith (of the matter).</p>

					<p class="f4">But, revered sir,<br />
					when those who are wise,<br />
					experienced,<br />
					clever,<br />
					speak in praise or dispraise of others<br />
					after test and scrutiny,<br />
					we fall back on that<br />
					as the pith (of the matter).</p>

					<p class="f4">But what, revered Ānanda, is the bodily conduct<br />
					that is offensive<br />
					to intelligent recluses and brahmans?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever the bodily conduct, sire,<br />
					that is unskilled."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, revered sir,<br />

					how well spoken is this, revered sir,<br />
					by the venerable Ānanda;<br />
					and we, revered sir,<br />
					are delighted and satisfied with the venerable Ānanda's well spoken words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being thus delighted and satisfied, revered sir,<br />
					with the venerable Ānanda's well spoken words,<br />
					we would give a <a id="pg300"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span></a> valuable elephant<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda<br />
					if this, revered sir, were allowable<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					we would give a valuable horse<br />
					if this, revered sir, were allowable<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					we would give the boon of a village<br />
					if tis, revered sir, were allowable<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">But then we know this, revered sir:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not allowable<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">This piece of foreign cloth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> revered sir,<br />
					inserted into the shaft of a sunshade,<br />
					has been sent to me<br />
					by King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of (the lady) Videhī<br />
					in length it is equal to sixteen (hands<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>),<br />
					in breadth to eight (hands).</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir,<br />
					let the venerable Ānanda accept it<br />
					out of compassion."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sire,<br />
					I am complete as to the three robes."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, after a great storm<br />
					has rained down on the high mountain slopes,<br />
					both you and I have seen<br />
					how at such a time<br />
					the river Aciravati rushes along<br />
					overflowing both its banks<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					even so, revered sir, the venerable Ānanda<br />
					can make a set of three robes for himself<br />
					from this piece of foreign cloth;<br />
					and the venerable Ānanda can distribute<br />
					his old set of three robes<br />
					among his fellow Brahma-farers.</p>

					<p class="f4">So will this gift of faith of ours<br />
					go on with an overflow, methinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, let the venerable Ānanda<br />
					accept this piece of foreign doth."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda<br />
					accepted the piece of foreign cloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it please you,<br />
					we are going now, revered sir,<br />
					we are very busy,<br />
					there is much to be done."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You must do now, sire,<br />
					that for which you deem it the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the venerable Ānanda had said,<br />
					giving thanks,<br />
					rising from his seat<br />
					and greeting the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					departed<br />
					keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then not long after King Pasenadi had departed,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the venerable Ānanda told the Lord<br />
					the whole of the conversation<br />
					he had had with King Pasenadi,<br />
					and he handed that piece of foreign cloth to the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is a gain for King Pasenadi,<br />
					<a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> it is well gotten by King Pasenadi<br />
					that he achieved a sight of Ānanda,<br />
					that he achieved a paying of homage to him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord;<br />
					delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

But that is an unusually large piece of cloth. On the other hand the whole idea is that the value of the cloth is in it's uniqueness. Such a large measure of cloth fitting into the shaft of an umbrella. Plus we don't know the diameter of the shaft, but this sort of skilled craftsmanship was practiced at the time. e.g., a needle case that was as fine as a fine needle and strong enough to be driven through a sheet of iron.</p>
