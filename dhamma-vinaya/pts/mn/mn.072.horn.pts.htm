					<p class="f4">"'Both arises and does not arise,' Vaccha, does not apply."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, good Gotama, on being asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, good Gotama, does he neither arise nor not arise?"</p>

					<p class="f4">you say:</p>

					I am bewildered,<br />
					and that measure of satisfaction I had<br />

					<p class="f4">"You ought to be at a loss, Vaccha,<br />
					you ought to be bewildered.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Vaccha, this dhamma is deep,<br />
					difficult to see,<br />
					difficult to understand,<br />
					peaceful,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					beyond dialectic,<br />
					subtle,<br />
					intelligible to the wise;<br />
					but it is hard for you<br />

					another allegiance,<br />

					of a different observance,<br />
					and under a different teacher.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, Vaccha,<br />
					I will now question you in return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as it pleases you.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Vaccha?</p>

					<p class="f4">If a fire were blazing in front of you<br />
					would you know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This fire is blazing in front of me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, if a fire were blazing in front of me<br />
					I should know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This fire is blazing in front of me.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if, Vaccha,<br />
					someone were to question you thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This fire that is blazing in front of you -<br />
					what is the reason that this fire is blazing?' -</p>

					<p class="f4">what would you, Vaccha,<br />
					reply when questioned thus?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, good Gotama,<br />
					someone were to question me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This fire that is blazing in front of you -<br />
					what is the reason that this fire is <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> blazing?' -</p>

					<p class="f4">I, good Gotama,<br />
					on being questioned thus<br />
					would reply thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This fire that is blazing in front of me -<br />
					this fire is blazing because of a supply<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of grass and sticks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If that fire that was in front of you, Vaccha,<br />
					were to be quenched,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					would you know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This fire that was in front of me<br />
					has been quenched'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, good Gotama,<br />
					that fire that was in front of me<br />
					were to be quenched,<br />
					I would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This fire that was in front of me<br />
					has been quenched."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if someone were to question you thus, Vaccha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That fire that was in front of you<br />
					and that has been quenched -<br />
					to which direction has that fire gone from here,<br />
					to the east<br />
					or west<br />
					or north<br />
					or south?</p>

					<p class="f4">On being questioned thus,<br />
					what would you, Vaccha, reply?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does not apply, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, good Gotama,<br />
					that fire blazed<br />
					because of a supply of grass and sticks,<br />
					yet from having totally consumed this<br />
					and from the lack of other fuel,<br />
					being without fuel<br />
					it is reckoned to be quenched."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, Vaccha,<br />
