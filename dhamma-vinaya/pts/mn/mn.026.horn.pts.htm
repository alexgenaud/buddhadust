					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed early,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks approached the venerable Ānanda;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is long since we, reverend Ānanda,<br />
					heard a talk on Dhamma<br />
					face-to-face with the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good if we, reverend Ānanda,<br />
					got a chance of hearing a talk on Dhamma<br />
					face-to-face with the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, the venerable ones<br />
					should go to the hermitage of the brahman Rāmaka,<br />
					and probably you would get a chance<br />
					of hearing a talk on Dhamma<br />
					face-to-face with the Lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />
					these monks answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having walked for alms in Sāvatthī,<br />
					returning from (the quest for) alms,<br />
					after the meal,<br />
					said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will go along, Ānanda,<br />
					and approach the Eastern Park,<br />
					the palace of Migāra's mother,<br />
					for the day sojourn."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Lord,"<br />
					the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in <a id="pg204"><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></a> assent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[161]</b> Then the Lord<br />
					together with the venerable Ānanda<br />
					approached the Eastern Park,<br />
					the palace of Migāra's mother<br />
					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					emerging from seclusion towards evening,<br />
					said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will go along, Ānanda,<br />
					and approach the Eastern Porch<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to bathe our limbs."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Lord,"<br />
					the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					together with the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					approached the Eastern Porch<br />
					to bathe their limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had bathed his limbs<br />
					at the Eastern Porch<br />
					and had come out (of the water),<br />
					he stood in a single robe<br />
					drying his limbs.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this hermitage of the brahman Rāmaka<br />
					is not far;<br />
					the hermitage of the brahman Rāmaka is lovely, Lord;<br />
					the hermitage of the brahman Rāmaka is beautiful, Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good, Lord,<br />
					if out of compassion<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the Lord were to approach the hermitage<br />
					of the brahman Rāmaka."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord approached<br />
					the hermitage of the brahman Rāmaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time<br />
					a number of monks came to be sitting down<br />
					and talking dhamma<br />
					in the hermitage of the brahman Rāmaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord stood outside the porch<br />
					waiting for the talk to finish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					knowing that the talk had finished,<br />
					coughed<br />
					and knocked on the bar of the door;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					those monks opened the door to the Lord.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having entered the hermitage <a id="pg205"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span></a> of the brahman Rāmaka,<br />
					sat down on the appointed seat.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down,<br />
					the Lord said to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you were sitting down just now,<br />
					what was your talk about, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">What was your talk that was interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, our talk that was interrupted<br />
					was about the Lord himself;<br />
					then he arrived."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It were good, monks,<br />
					that when young men of family such as you<br />
					who have gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness out of faith<br />
					are gathered together<br />
					that you talk about Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you are gathered together, monks,<br />
					there are two things to be done:<br />
					either talk about Dhamma<br />
					or the Ariyan silence.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the two quests:<br />
					the Ariyan quest<br />
					and the un-Ariyan quest.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the un-Ariyan quest?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the un-Ariyan quest.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the Ariyan quest?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, monks, someone,<br />
					being liable to birth because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />

					seeks the unborn,<br />

					<p class="f4">being liable to ageing because of self,<br />

					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the Ariyan quest.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I too, monks,<br />
					before awakening,<br />
					while I was still the bodhisatta,<br />
					not fully awakened,<br />
					being liable to birth because of self,<br />
					sought what was likewise liable to birth;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to ageing because of self,<br />
					sought what was likewise liable to ageing;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to disease because of self,<br />
					sought what was likewise liable to disease;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to dying because of self,<br />

					<p class="f4">being liable to sorrow because of self,<br />
					sought what was likewise liable to sorrow;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to stain because of self,<br />
					sought what was likewise liable to stain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why do I,<br />
					liable to birth because of self,<br />
					seek what is likewise liable to birth;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to ageing because of self,<br />
					seek what was likewise liable to ageing;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to disease because of self,<br />
					seek what was likewise liable to disease;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to dying because of self,<br />
					seek what was likewise liable to dying;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to sorrow because of self,<br />
					seek what was likewise liable to sorrow;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to stain because of self,<br />
					seek what was likewise liable to stain?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I,<br />
					(although) being liable to birth because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is likewise liable to birth,<br />
					should seek the unborn,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Being liable to ageing because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is likewise liable to ageing,<br />
					should seek the unageing,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Being liable decay because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is likewise liable to decay,<br />
					should seek the undecaying,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Being liable to dying because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is likewise liable to dying,<br />
					should seek the undying,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Being liable to sorrow because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is likewise liable to sorrow,<br />
					should seek the unsorrowing,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Being liable to stain because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is likewise liable to stain,<br />
					should seek the stainless,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					after a time,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					being young,<br />
					my hair coal-black,<br />
					possessed of radiant<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> youth,<br />
					in the prime of my life —<br />
					although my unwilling parents wept and wailed —<br />
					having cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					having put on yellow robes,<br />
					went forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, being gone forth thus,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, monks,<br />
					Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					this dhamma is such<br />
					that an intelligent man,<br />
					having soon realized super- <a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> knowledge for himself<br />
					(as learnt from) his own teacher,<br />
					may enter on and abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					mastered that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monks,<br />
					as far as mere lip service,<br />
					mere repetition<br />
					were concerned,<br />
					spoke the doctrine of knowledge,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the doctrine of the elders,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and I claimed —<br />
					I as well as others —<br />
					that 'I know, I see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But Āḷāra the Kālāma<br />
					does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br />
					simply out of faith:<br />
					Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					I am abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing,<br />
					seeing this dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, monks,<br />
					approach Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					having realized super-knowledge for yourself,<br />
					entering thereon,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, monks,<br />
					Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy,<br />
					I too have energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness,<br />
					I too have mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration,<br />
					I too have concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive<br />
					for the realisation of that dhamma<br />
					which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					I am abiding therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on that dhamma,<br />
					abided therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it to this extent<br />
					that you, reverend Kalama,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realized it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is to this extent<br />
					that I, your reverence,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realized it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br />
					having realized this dhamma<br />
					by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					am abiding in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br />
					it is well gotten for us,<br />
					your reverence,<br />
					that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer<br />
					such as the venerable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This dhamma that I,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					proclaim,<br />
					having realized it by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					<a id="pg209"><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span></a> having realized it by your own super-knowledge;<br />
					the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					having realized it by your own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that I,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					proclaim,<br />
					having realized it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that you know.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that you know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br />
					being just the two of us,<br />
					let us look after this group.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, monks,<br />
					did Āḷāra the Kālāma,<br />
					being my teacher,<br />
					set me —<br />
					the pupil —<br />
					on the same level as himself<br />
					and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br />
					nor to dispassion<br />
					nor to stopping<br />
					nor to tranquillity<br />
					nor to super-knowledge<br />
					nor to awakening<br />
					nor to Nibbāna,<br />
					but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks,<br />
					not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, your reverence,<br />
					want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, monks,<br />
					Uddaka, Rāma's son, spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br />
					this dhamma is such<br />
					that an intelligent man,<br />
					having soon realized super-knowledge for himself,<br />
					(as learnt from) his own teacher,<br />
					may enter on and abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					mastered that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monks,<br />
					as far as mere lip service,<br />
					mere repetition were concerned,<br />
					spoke the doctrine of knowledge<br />
					and the doctrine of the elders,<br />
					and I claimed —<br />
					I as well as others —<br />
					that 'I know, I see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But Uddahka, Rāma's son,<br />
					does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br />
					simply out of faith:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					I am abiding in it."</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />
					proceeds knowing and seeing this dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, monks,<br />
					approach Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Rāma,<br />
					having realized super-knowledge for yourself,<br />
					entering thereon<br />
					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, monks,<br />
					Uddahka, Rāma's son,<br />
					proclaimed the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only Rāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Rāma who has energy,<br />
					I too have energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Rāma who has mindfulness,<br />
					I too have mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not only Rāma who has concentration,<br />
					I too have concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not <a id="pg210"><span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span></a> only Rāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive<br />
					for the realisation of that dhamma<br />
					which Rāma proclaims:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it I am abiding in it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					having realized super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on that dhamma,<br />
					abided therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it to this extent<br />
					that you, reverend Rāma,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realized it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is to this extent<br />
					that I, your reverence,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realized it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br />
					having realized this dhamma<br />
					by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					am abiding in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br />
					it is well gotten by us,<br />
					your reverence,<br />
					that we see a fellow-Brahmā-farer<br />
					such as the venerable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This dhamma that I,<br />
					entering on, proclaim,<br />
					having realized it by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					having realized it by your own super-knowledge;<br />
					the dhamma that you,<br />
					entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					having realized it by your own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that I,<br />
					entering on, proclaim,<br />
					having realized it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that you know.</p>

					<p class="f4">That dhamma that you know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br />
					being just the two of us,<br />
					let us look after this group.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, monks,<br />
					did Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />
					being my teacher,<br />
					set me —<br />
					the pupil —<br />
					on the same level as himself<br />
					and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br />
					nor to dispassion<br />
					nor to stopping<br />
					nor to tranquillity<br />
					nor to super-knowledge<br />
					nor to awakening<br />
					nor to Nibbāna,<br />
					but only as far as reaching<br />
					the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks,<br />
					not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					walking on tour through Magadha<br />
					in due course arrived at Uruvela,<br />
					the camp township.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I saw a delightful stretch of land<br />
					and a lovely woodland grove,<br />
					and a clear flowing river<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with a delightful ford,<br />
					and a <a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> village for support nearby.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it it is a delightful stretch of land,<br />
					and the woodland grove is lovely,<br />
					and the river flows clear<br />
					with a delightful ford,<br />
					and there is a village for support nearby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed this does well<br />
					for the striving of a young man<br />
					set on striving.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, monks, sat down just there,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this does well for striving.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, monks,<br />
					being liable to birth because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is liable to birth,<br />
					seeking the unborn,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna —<br />
					won the unborn,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to ageing because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is liable to ageing,<br />
					seeking the unageing,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna —<br />
					won the unageing,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to decay because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is liable to decay,<br />
					seeking the undecaying,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna —<br />
					won the undecaying,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to dying because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is liable to dying,<br />
					seeking the undying,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna —<br />
					won the undying,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to sorrow because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is liable to sorrow,<br />
					seeking the unsorrowing,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna —<br />
					won the unsorrowing,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna;</p>

					<p class="f4">being liable to stain because of self,<br />
					having known the peril<br />
					in what is liable to stain,<br />
					seeking the stainless,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna —<br />
					won the stainless,<br />
					the uttermost security from the bonds —<br />
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge and vision arose in me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unshakable is freedom for me,<br />
					this is the last birth,<br />
					there is not now again-becoming.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> won to by me,<br />
					is deep,<br />
					difficult to see,<br />
					difficult to understand,<br />
					tranquil,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					beyond dialectic,<br />
					subtle,<br />
					intelligible to the learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this is a creation<br />
					delighting in sensual pleasure,<br />
					delighted by sensual pleasure,<br />
					rejoicing in sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">So that for a creation<br />
					delighting in sensual pleasure,<br />
					delighted by sensual pleasure,<br />
					rejoicing in sensual pleasure,<br />
					this were a matter difficult to see,<br />
					that is to say<br />
					causal uprising by way of condition.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too were a matter difficult to see,<br />
					that is to say the tranquillising<br />
					of all the activities,<br />
					the renunciation<br />
					of all attachment,<br />
					the destruction of <a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a> craving,<br />
					dispassion,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if I were to teach Dhamma<br />
					and others were not to understand me,<br />
					that would be a weariness to me,<br />
					that would be a vexation to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, these verses<br />
					not heard before in the past<br />
					spontaneously occurred to me:</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">This that through many toils I've won —<br />
							Enough! why should I make it known?<br />
							By folk with lust and hate consumed<br />
							This dhamma is not understood.</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">Leading on against the stream,<br />
							Deep, subtle, difficult to see, delicate,<br />
							Unseen 'twill be by passion's slaves<br />
							Cloaked in the murk of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise,<br />
					as I was pondering, monks,<br />
					my mind inclined<br />
					to little effort<br />
					and not teaching dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					who knew with his mind<br />
					the reasoning in my mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas, the world is lost,<br />
					alas, the world is destroyed,<br />
					inasmuch as the mind of the Tathāgata,<br />
					the perfected one, the fully awakened one,<br />
					inclines to little effort<br />
					and not to teaching Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, as a strong man<br />
					might stretch out his bent arm,<br />
					or might bend back his outstretched arm,<br />
					even so did Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					vanishing from the Brahmā-world,<br />
					become manifest before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted me with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Lord teach Dhamma,<br />
					let the well-farer teach Dhamma;<br />
					there are beings with little dust in their eyes<br />
					who; not hearing Dhamma,<br />
					are decaying,<br />
					(but if) they are learners of Dhamma<br />
					they will grow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati to me, monks;<br />
					having said this,<br />
					he further spoke thus:</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">'There has appeared in Magadha before thee<br />
							An unclean dhamma by (minds) with stains devised.<br />
							Open this door of deathlessness; let them hear<br />
							Dhamma awakened to by the stainless one.</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">As on a crag on crest of mountain standing<br />
							A man might watch the people all around,<br />
							E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br />
							O Seer of all, the terraced heights of truth,<br />
							Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples<br />
							Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr"><a id="pg213"><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></a> Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br />
							Thou leader of the caravan, without a debt!<br />
							Walk in the world. Let the Blessed One<br />
							Teach dhamma; they who learn will grow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then I, monks,<br />
					having understood Brahmā's entreaty,<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					surveyed the world<br />
					with the eye of an Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I, monks,<br />
					was surveying the world<br />
					with the eye of an Awakened One,<br />
					I saw beings with little dust in their eyes,<br />
					with much dust in their eyes,<br />
					with acute faculties<br />
					with dull faculties,<br />
					of good dispositions,<br />
					of bad dispositions,<br />
					docile,<br />
					indocile,<br />
					few seeing from fear<br />
					sins<br />
					and the world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as in a pond of blue lotuses<br />
					or in a pond of red lotuses<br />
					or in a pond of white lotuses,<br />
					a few red and blue and white lotuses<br />
					are born in the water,<br />
					grow in the water,<br />
					do not rise above the water<br />
					but thrive while altogether immersed;<br />
					a few blue or red or white lotuses<br />
					are born in the water,<br />
					grow in the water<br />
					and reach the surface of the water;<br />
					a few blue or reel or white lotuses<br />
					are born in the water,<br />
					grow in the water<br />
					and stand rising out of the water,<br />
					undefiled by the water;<br />
					even so did I, monks,<br />
					surveying the world<br />
					with the eye of an Awakened One,<br />
					see beings with little dust in their eyes,<br />
					with much dust in their eyes,<br />
					with acute faculties,<br />
					with dull faculties,<br />
					of good dispositions,<br />
					of bad dispositions,<br />
					docile,<br />
					indocile,<br />
					few seeing from fear<br />
					sins<br />
					and the world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					addressed Brahmā Sahampati in verses:</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">Opened for those who hear are the doors of the Deathless, Brahmā,<br />
							Let them give forth their faith;<br />
							Thinking of useless fatigue, Brahmā, I have not preached dhamma<br />
							Sublime and excellent for men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, Brahmā Sahampati, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The opportunity was made by me<br />
					for the Lord to teach dhamma,'<br />
					having greeted me,<br />
					keeping his right side towards me,<br />
					vanshed then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, to whom should I first teach this dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will understand this dhamma quickly?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this Āḷāra the Kālāma<br />
					is learned,<br />
					experienced,<br />
					wise,<br />
					and for a long time<br />
					has had little dust in his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to teach Dhamma<br />
					first to Āḷāra the Kālāma<br />
					he will understand this Dhamma quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then devatās having approached me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So knowledge and vision arose in me<br />
					that Āḷāra the Kālāma<br />
					had passed away seven days ago.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg214"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></a> Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Āḷāra the Kālāma has suffered a great loss.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For if he had heard this Dhamma,<br />
					he would have understood it quickly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, to whom could I first teach this Dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will understand this Dhamma quickly?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to teach Dhamma<br />
					first to Uddaka, Rāma's son?</p>

					<p class="f4">He will understand this Dhamma quickly,'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, devatas, having approached me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Uddaka, Rāma's son, passed away last night,'</p>

					<p class="f4">So knowledge and vision arose in me<br />
					that Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />
					had passed away last night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Uddaka, Rāma's son, has suffered a great loss.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if he had heard this Dhamma,<br />
					he would have understood it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now to whom could I first teach this Dhamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will understand this dhamma quickly?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This group of five monks<br />
					who waited on me when I was self-resolute in striving,<br />
					were very helpful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to teach Dhamma<br />
					first to this group of five monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But where is the group of five monks<br />
					staying at present?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks I saw<br />
					with deva-vision,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					the group of five monks<br />
					staying near Benares<br />
					at Isipatana<br />
					in the deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					having stayed at Uruvelā<br />
					for as long as I found suiting,<br />
					set out on tour for Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, <a id="upaka" href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/upaka.htm">Upaka,</a> the Naked Ascetic,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saw me as I was going along the high road<br />
					between Gayā and the (Tree of) Awakening;<br />
					having seen me,<br />
					he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverence,<br />
					your faculties are quite pure,<br />
					your complexion is very bright,<br />
					very clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">On account of whom<br />
					have you, your reverence,<br />
					gone forth,<br />
					or who is your teacher,<br />
					or whose Dhamma do you profess?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, monks, addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic,<br />
					in verses:</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">'Victorious over all, omniscient am I,<br />
							Among all things undefiled,<br />
							Leaving all, through death of craving freed,<br />

							<p class="f4 ctr"><a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> For me there is no teacher,<br />

							I alone am all-awakened,<br />
							Become cool am I, Nibbāna-attained.</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">To turn the dhamma-wheel<br />

					<p class="f4">'According to what you claim, your reverence,<br />
					you ought to be victor of the unending.'</p>

							<p class="f4 ctr">'Like me, they are victors indeed<br />
							Who have won destruction of the cankers;<br />
							Vanquished by me are evil things,<br />
							Therefore am I, Upaka, a victor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, monks,<br />
					Upaka the Naked Ascetic, having said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May it be (so), your reverence,"</p>

					<p class="f4">having shaken his head,<br />
					went off having taken a different road.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monks,<br />
					walking on tour,<br />
					in due course arrived at Benares,<br />
					Isipatana,<br />
					the deer-park<br />
					and the group of five monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the group of five monks<br />
					saw me coming in the distance,<br />
					and seeing me they agreed among themselves,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverences,<br />
					this recluse Gotama is coming,<br />
					he lives in abundance,<br />
					he is wavering in his striving,<br />
					he has reverted to a life of abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He should be neither greeted,<br />
					nor stood up for,<br />
					nor should his bowl and robe be received;<br />
					all the same<br />
					a seat may be put out,<br />
					he can sit down if he wants to.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But as I, monks,<br />
					gradually approached this group of five monks,<br />
					so this group of five monks<br />
					were not able to adhere to their own agreement;<br />
					having approached me<br />
					some received my bowl and robe,<br />
					some made a seat ready,<br />
					some brought water for washing the feet,<br />
					and they addressed me by my name<br />
					and with the epithet<br />
					'your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					I, monks, spoke thus to the group of five monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not, monks, address a Tathāgata<br />
					by his name<br />
					or by the epithet 'your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the Tathāgata is one perfected,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear, monks,<br />
					the deathless is found,<br />
					I instruct, I teach Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going along <a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> in accordance with what is enjoined,<br />

					rightly go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness,<br />
					you will abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, monks,<br />
					the group of five monks addressed me thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But you, reverend Gotama,<br />
					did not come to a state of further-men,<br />
