					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi<br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered one," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus: </p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, an inquiring monk,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					learning the range<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of another's mind,<br />
					should make a study<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> of the Tathāgata<br />
					so as to distinguish<br />
					whether he is a fully Self-awakened One<br />
					or not."</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Lord,<br />
					things are rooted in the Lord,<br />
					have the Lord for their conduit,<br />
					the Lord for their arbiter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for us, Lord,<br />
					if the Lord would reveal the meaning of this saying;<br />
					having heard the Lord,<br />
					the monks will remember."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, monks;<br />
					listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord,"<br />
					these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, an inquiring monk,<br />
					learning the range of another's mind,<br />
					should make a study of the Tathāgata<br />
					in regard to two things:<br />
					things cognisable through the eye<br />
					and through the ear,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do those that are impure states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and the ear<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is studying this<br />
					he knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those impure states<br />
					which are cognisable through the eye and the ear<br />
					do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">After he has studied this<br />
					and knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those impure states<br />
					which are cognisable through the eye and the ear<br />
					do not exist in a Tathāgata,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he then studies further, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do those that are mixed states<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					cognisable through the eye and the ear<br />

					<p class="f4">While he is studying this<br />

					<p class="f4">he then studies further:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do there exist any perils<br />
					for that venerable monk<br />
					who has attained to fame<br />
					and won renown?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are some perils<br />
					that do not exist here for a monk<br />
					until he has attained to fame<br />
					and won renown.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, monks,<br />
					after a monk has attained to fame<br />
					and won renown<br />
					that some perils exist for him here.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is studying this<br />
					he knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Although the venerable monk<br />
					has attained to fame and won renown,<br />
					some perils do not exist for him here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">After he has studied this<br />

					<p class="f4">'Although this venerable monk<br />
					has attained to fame and won renown,<br />
					some perils do not exist for him here,'</p>

					<p class="f4">he then studies further:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Does this venerable one<br />
					refrain out of fearlessness,<br />
					does not he refrain out of fear?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Is it because,<br />
					through the destruction of attachment,<br />
					that, being without attachment,<br />
					he does not follow pleasures of the senses?'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is studying this<br />
					he knows thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one<br />
					refrains out of fearlessness,<br />
					this venerable one refrains<br />
					not out of fear;<br />
					he does not follow pleasures of the senses<br />

					he is without attachment.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, monks, others should question this monk thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What are the venerable one's facts,<br />
					what his evidence<br />
					by reason of which<br />
					the venerable one speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one<br />
					refrains out of <a id="pg381"><span class="f2 g"><b>[381]</b></span></a> fearlessness,<br />
					this venerable one<br />
					refrains not out of fear;<br />
					he does not follow pleasures of the senses<br />
					because, through the destruction of attachment,<br />
					he is without attachment'?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk answering properly<br />
					would answer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one,<br />
					whether staying in an Order<br />
					or staying alone,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />

					by any material things here –<br />
					this venerable one<br />
					does not despise them because of this.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This have I heard<br />
					face to face with the Lord,<br />
					this have I learnt<br />
					face to face with him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am restrained out of fearlessness,<br />
					I am not restrained out of fear;<br />
					without attachment because of the destruction of attachment,<br />
					I do not follow pleasures of the senses.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the Tathāgata should himself<br />
					be further questioned hereon:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do those impure states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br />
					exist in the Tathāgata or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in answering,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a Tathāgata would answer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those impure states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br />
					do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do those mixed states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br />
					exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in answering,<br />
					a Tathāgata would answer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those mixed states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br />
					do not exist in a Tathāgata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do those absolutely pure states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br />
					exist in a Tathāgata or not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, in answering,<br />
					a Tathāgata would answer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those absolutely pure states<br />
					cognisable through the eye and through the ear<br />
					exist in a Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my path,<br />
					this is my pasture<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and no one is like (me) in this.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a disciple should draw near<br />
					a teacher who speaks like this<br />
					so as to hear <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">From further to further,<br />
					from excellence to excellence,<br />
					the Teacher teaches him <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					what is dark<br />
					and what is bright,<br />
					with their counterparts.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As, monks, the Teacher<br />
					gradually teaches <a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[382]</b></span></a> <i>Dhamma</i> to the monk,<br />
					from further to further,<br />
					from excellence to excellence,<br />
					what is dark and what is bright<br />
					with their counterparts,<br />
					so does he gradually<br />
					by his superknowledge<br />
					of point after point of <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					come to fulfilment in <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">He has confidence in the Teacher,<br />
					that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is a fully Self-awakened One,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Order fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if others should ask that monk:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what are the venerable one's facts,<br />
					what the evidence<br />
					by reason of which he speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is a fully Self-awakened one,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Order fares along well?'</p>

					<p class="f4">that monk, monks,<br />
					answering rightly<br />
					would answer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, your reverences,<br />
					drew near the Lord<br />
					so as to hear <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord taught me <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					from further to further,<br />
					from excellence to excellence,<br />
					what is dark<br />
					and what is bright<br />
					with their counterparts.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the Lord gradually taught me <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					from further to further,<br />
					from excellence to excellence,<br />
					what is dark and what is bright<br />
					with their counterparts,<br />
					so did I gradually<br />
					by my superknowledge<br />
					of point after point in <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					come to fulfilment in <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I have confidence in the Teacher,<br />
					that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is a fully Self-awakened One,<br />
					well taught is <i>Dhamma</i> by the Lord,<br />
					the Order fares along well.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in anyone<br />
					in whom faith in the Teacher is established,<br />
					rooted,<br />
					supported by these methods,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by these sentences,<br />
					by these words,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that faith is called reasoned,<br />
					based on vision,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					strong;<br />
					it is indestructible<br />
					by a recluse<br />
					or brahman<br />
					or <i>deva</i><br />
					or Māra<br />
					or a Brahmā<br />
					or by anyone in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, does there come to be<br />
					study of the Tathāgata's <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					and thus does the Tathāgata<br />
					come to be well studied<br />
					in the proper manner."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
