<meta name="description" content="I.B. Horner's translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 82. The story of Ratthapala who, inspired by a Dhammatalk given by the Buddha wishes to enter the order but is refused the permission of his parents. He vows to die on the spot unless he receives permission and after many pleadings by his parents and friends finally gets his parents concent. He thereafter quickly becomes arahant. On revisiting his family he is first unrecognized and subjected to abuse, then his father tries to tempt him to return to the world with gold and his former wives. He is not persuaded and delivers a sermon in verses on the subject of the pains in the world. Still later he discourses to the king on four doctrines of the Buddha concerning the futility of living in the world." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord,<br />
					walking on tour among the Kurus<br />
					together with a large Order of monks<br />
					arrived at the market <a id="pg251"><span class="f2 g"><b>[251]</b></span></a> town of the Kurus<br />
					called Thullakoṭṭhita.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan family,<br />
					walking on tour among the Kurus<br />
					together with a large Order of monks<br />
					has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita.</p>

					<p class="f4">A lovely report about the revered Gotama has gone forth thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'This Lord is perfected,<br />
							wholly Self-Awakened,<br />
							endowed with (right) knowledge and conduct,<br />
							well-farer,<br />
							knower of the worlds,<br />
							incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
							teacher of devas and men,<br />
							the Awakened One,<br />
							the Lord.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">He makes known this world<br />
							with the devas,<br />
							with Māra,<br />
							with Brahma,<br />
							creation with its recluses and brahmans,<br />
							its devas and men,<br />
							having realised them<br />
							by his own super-knowledge.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">With the meaning and the spirit<br />
							he teaches dhamma<br />
							that is lovely in the beginning,<br />
							lovely in the middle,<br />
							lovely at the ending;<br />
							he proclaims the Brahma-faring wholly fulfilled,<br />
							quite purified.</p>

							<p class="f4">It were good to see perfected ones like this.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					some, having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some exchanged greetings with the Lord,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, becoming silent,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita<br />
					were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited<br />
					and delighted them<br />
					with a talk on dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a young man of family<br />
					named Raṭṭhapāla,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the son of a leading family<br />
					in that very Thullakoṭṭhita,<br />
					was sitting down in this assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					the young man of family:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"In so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,<br />
					it is no easy matter for one living in a house<br />
					to fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled,<br />
					completely pure<br />
					and polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					should go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita,<br />
					gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited<br />
					and delighted<br />
					by the Lord's talk on dhamma,<br />
					rejoicing <a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span></a> in what the Lord had said<br />
					and giving thanks for it,<br />
					rising from their seats<br />
					and greeting the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping their right sides towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita had departed,<br />
					Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In so far as I, revered sir,<br />
					understand dhamma taught by the Lord,<br />
					it is no easy matter<br />
					for one living in a house<br />
					to fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled,<br />
					completely pure<br />
					and polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">I wish, revered sir,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					to go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I, revered sir,<br />
					receive the going forth<br />
					in the Lord's presence,<br />
					may I receive ordination."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But have you, Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					your parents consent<br />
					for going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have not, revered sir,<br />
					the consent of my parents<br />
					for going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Raṭṭhapāla, Tathāgatas do not allow (one<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>) to go forth<br />
					without the consent of the parents."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir,<br />
					will do whatever is necessary<br />
					so that my parents will consent<br />
					to my going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					having greeted the Lord<br />
					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					rising from his seat<br />
					approached his parents;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to his parents:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mother and father,<br />
					in so far as I understand dhamma taught by the Lord,<br />
					it is no easy matter<br />
					for one living in a home<br />
					to fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled,<br />
					completely pure,<br />
					and polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">I wish,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having donned saffron garments,<br />
					to go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consent to my going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					spoke thus to him:</p>

					are our only child,<br />
					dear and beloved,<br />
					you live in comfort<br />
					and are well cared for;<br />
					you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					do not know anything of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					eat and drink<br />
					and amuse yourself;<br />
					eating,<br />
					drinking<br />
					and amusing yourself,<br />
					you can enjoy diverting yourself<br />
					with sense-pleasures<br />
					and doing meritorious things.</p>

					<p class="f4">We do not consent <a id="pg253"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></a><br />
					that you should go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you were to die<br />
					we should be desolate without you.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could we,<br />
					while you are living,<br />
					consent to your going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					spoke thus to his parents:</p>

					<p class="f4">Consent to the going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness<br />
					of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family."</p>

					<p class="f4">"We consent, dears,<br />
					to the going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness<br />
					of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family.</p>

					<p class="f4">But after he has gone forth,<br />
					he must come and see us."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					approached him;<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					they spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You, good Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					are your parents' only child,<br />
					dear and beloved,<br />
					you live in comfort<br />
					and are well cared for;<br />
					you, good Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					do not know anything of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Get up,<br />
					eat and drink<br />
					and amuse yourself;<br />
					eating,<br />

					<p class="f4">Your parents have consented<br />
					to your going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness,<br />
					but after you have gone forth<br />
					you must see your parents."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					having got up<br />
					and regained his strength,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir,<br />
					have my parents' consent<br />
					for the going forth from home<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Lord let me go forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					received the going forth<br />
					in the Lord's presence,<br />
					he received ordination.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had been ordained -<br />
					half a month after he had been ordained -<br />
					the Lord, having stayed for as long as he found suitable in Thullakoṭṭhita,<br />
					set out on tour for Sāvatthī;<br />
					and in due course,<br />
					walking on tour,<br />
					he arrived at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there<br />
					the Lord stayed near Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Jeta Grove<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					dwelling alone,<br />
					aloof,<br />
					diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					having soon realised<br />
					here and now<br />
					by his own super-knowledge<br />
					that incomparable goal of the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of which<br />
					young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home<br />
					into homelessness,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					he abided in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla<br />
					was one of the perfected ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I want, revered sir,<br />
					to see my parents,<br />
					if the Lord allows me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord<br />
					with his mind carefully reflected<br />
					on the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's reasoning of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord knew<br />
					that it was impossible for the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					throwing off the training,<br />
					to return to the secular life,<br />
					then the Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do now, Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					that for which you think it is the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord<br />
					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					having packed away his bedding,<br />
					set out on tour for Thullakoṭṭhita<br />
					taking his bowl and robe;<br />
					and in due course,<br />
					walking on tour,<br />
					he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> While he was there,<br />
					the venerable Raṭṭhapāla stayed near Thullakoṭṭhita<br />
					in the deer-park of the Kuru king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					dressing in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Thullakoṭṭhita for almsfood;<br />
					while he was walking on an uninterrupted round for almsfood,<br />
					he approached his own parents' house.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father<br />
					was having his hair combed<br />
					in the middle hall<br />
					which had a door.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He saw the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, coming in the distance,<br />
					and seeing him,<br />
					he spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Our only son,<br />
					dear and beloved,<br />
					has gone forth among these shaveling recluses."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					received neither alms nor a refusal<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at his own father's house;<br />
					all he received was abuse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the woman slave of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations<br />
					wanted to throw away<br />
					the previous evening's barley-gruel.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to her:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If that, sister,<br />
					is to be thrown away,<br />
					put it here in my bowl."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as the woman slave<br />
					of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations<br />
					was putting the previous evening's barley-gruel<br />
					into his bowl<br />
					she recognised his hands and feet and voice.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the woman slave<br />
					of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations<br />
					approached his mother,<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					she spoke thus to her:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it please you, madam,<br />
					you should know<br />
					that the young master Raṭṭhapāla is back."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now then, if you speak the truth,<br />
					you are a freed woman."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's mother<br />
					approached his father;<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					she spoke thus to his father:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it please you, householder,<br />
					you should know that Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					is indeed back."</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the venerable Raṭṭhapāla was eating the previous evening's barley-gruel<br />
					in a room provided for the purpose.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father approached him;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Can it be, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					<a id="pg257"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span></a> that you are eating last evening's barley-gruel?</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					you should come into your own home?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where, householder, is there a home<br />
					for us who have gone forth from home<br />
					into homelessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">We are houseless ones, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">I did come to your home, householder;<br />
					but I received neither alms there<br />
					nor a refusal;<br />
					all I received was abuse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					we will go to the house."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, householder,<br />
					I have done with eating for today."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					consent to a meal on the morrow."</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Raṭṭhapāla consented<br />
					by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father<br />
					had understood that he had consented,<br />
					he went up to his own dwelling;<br />
					and having gone there,<br />
					he had a great heap made<br />
					of gold coins and gold,<br />
					and having had them hidden with screens,<br />
					he summoned the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's former wives,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, daughters-in-law,<br />
					adorn yourselves with the adornments<br />
					adorned with which<br />
					you used to be dear to Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family,<br />
					and beloved by him."</p>

					<p class="f4">And towards the end of that night<br />
					the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father,<br />
					having had sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					prepared in his own dwelling,<br />
					had the time announced<br />
					to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					the meal is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached his own father's dwelling;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father,<br />
					having had that heap of gold coins and gold uncovered,<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					is your mother's wealth,<br />
					the other is your father's,<br />
					the other your paternal grandfather's.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is possible, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					both to enjoy riches<br />
					and do meritorious things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					throwing off the training<br />
					and returning to the secular life,<br />
					enjoy riches<br />
					and do meritorious things."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If you, householder,<br />
					would do my bidding,<br />
					having loaded this heap of gold coins and gold into wagons,<br />
					and then having had it brought down,<br />
					you would have it dropped<br />
					in the middle stream of the river Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from that source, householder,<br />
					that there will arise for you<br />
					grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair."</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking hold of his feet,<br />
					the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's former wives<br />
					<a id="pg258"><span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span></a> then spoke thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, young master,<br />
					of what kind<br />
					are those nymphs<br />
					for whose sake you fare the Brahma-faring?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We, sisters, do not fare the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of nymphs."</p>

					<p class="f4">Saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">"The young master Raṭṭhapāla<br />
					addresses us with the word 'sisters,'"</p>

					<p class="f4">they fell down fainting just there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla<br />
					spoke thus to his father:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If you would give food, householder,<br />
					give it;<br />
					but do not annoy us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla,<br />
					the meal is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father<br />
					with his own hand<br />
					served and satisfied the venerable Raṭṭhapāla<br />
					with sumptuous food,<br />
					solid and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had eaten<br />
					and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br />
					standing he spoke these verses:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Hair braided eightfold, eyes with collyrium smeared -<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg259"><span class="f2 g"><b>[259]</b></span></a> After the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had spoken these verses while he was standing,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Kuru king addressed a trapper,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sire,"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, good trapper,<br />

					<p class="f4">And when he had said:</p>

					<p class="f4">he had many lovely vehicles harnessed,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>bimba,</i> a shape, image; <i>cf.</i> <i>S.</i> i. 134. <i>MA.</i> iii. 301 = <i>DhA.</i> iii. 109 = <i>ThagA.</i> explain by <i>attabhāva.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>samussitaṁ.</i> <i>MA.</i> iii. 302 says that, with 300 bones, held together by 900 sinews, smeared with 900 lumps of flesh, it is built up (<i>ussita,</i> erected?) on every side.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>bahusaṁkappaṁ,</i> by others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>rājā Koravyo,</i> It is not clear whether Koravya was his personal name or a generic name of the king of the Kurus, See <i>DPPN.</i> s.v. Korabya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>migava.</i> <i>MA.</i> iii. 304 says this is the name of the keeper of the pleasaunce. If so, his name was derived from his occupation. The same word has already occurred in the first line of the last verse above, and there in no way seems to be a proper name. Chalmers translates as "huntsman." As a proper name <i>migava</i> is not included in <i>DPPN.</i> Moreover, in Pali, a proper name is usually further defined to show who the person was: brahman, householder, king and so on.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> As at <i>M.</i> ii. 113. Had the word <i>hattkatthara</i> not been translated as "clump of flowers" by Chalmers, it would have needed no comment. As it is, it must be noticed that at <i>Vin.</i> i. 192, <i>D.</i> i. 7, <i>A.</i> i. 181 it is in a sequence with <i>assatthara rathatthara,</i> horse-rug, chariot-rug, and therefore appears to be elephant-rug. <i>MA.</i> iii. 305 says that a thin "elephant-rug" filled with flowers (? <i>bahalapuppho</i>) having been folded double, is spread and indicated (<i>abhilakkhita,</i> distinguished) for it would not be suitable to sit on it uninvited.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>Upanīyati loko addhuvo.</i> On <i>upanīyati,</i> to be led, driven, to be carried on or away, see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.001-010.rhyc.pts.htm#fn15"><i>K.S.</i> i. 4, <i>n.</i> 1,</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Reading <i>alamatto</i> with the text, other versions and <i>MA.</i> iii. 307 against one tentative v.l. and <i>PED.</i> which read, as in other contexts, <i>alamattho.</i> The meaning in each case however seems to be <i>samattho</i> (as also at <i>DA.</i> 660), to which at <i>MA.</i> iii. 307 is added <i>attabhāvo,</i> the individual. <i>Samattha-atta-bhāva</i> would therefore mean: "the individual is sufficient unto himself," self-reliant, self-sufficient, which also could be taken as a meaning of <i>alam-atta,</i> "self is enough."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>DhA.</i> i. 7 <i>mahallakassa ... hatthapādā anassavā, honti,</i> an old man's arms and legs are disobedient.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>pariyodhāya vattissanti.</i> <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_02_devaputtasamyutta.htm#p10"><i>S.</i> i. 72-73</a> where the Buddhist view is given: that however many squadrons might guard <i>(rakkhanti)</i> a person, yet <i>attā</i> (self) is not guarded by them, <i>tesam arakkhito attā;</i> for theirs is merely an outer guard, not an inner.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>vehāsaṭṭha</i> (with v.l. <i>vehāsagata</i>) as at <i>Vin.</i> iii. 48. See <i>B.D.</i> i. p. 79, <i>n.</i> 6 for further references.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>ajjhāmsati.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Jā.</i> vi. 273, where <i>koravya</i> is explained as <i>Kururaṭṭha-vāsika,</i> a dweller in the Kuru kingdom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> In the following unmetrical rendering, I have attempted to be more exactly literal than either Mrs. Rhys Davids or Lord Chalmers. Otherwise I would have followed one or other of these beautiful versions, the former to be found in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p251"><i>Pss. Breath.,</i></a> and the latter in <i>Fur. Dial</i> ii., and both of which I have found very helpful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Meaning, I think, that they cannot be satiated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>phusanti phassaṁ,</i> <i>i.e.</i> they touch the touch, namely of dying, <i>maraṇa-phassa,</i> <i>MA.</i> iii. 308.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>bhavābhavesu,</i> explained at <i>MA.</i> iii. 308 as "in low and excellent becomings," and at <i>ThagA.</i> as <i>mahantāmantesu bhavesu. Bhavābhava</i> also occurs at <i>Sn.</i> 1060, 1068; and at <i>ThīgA.</i> 71, <i>saṁsaranto bhavābhave;</i> it means in the various becomings. <i>Cf.</i> <i>phalāphala,</i> a variety, or all kinds, of fruit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>saṁsāram āpajja,</i> undergoes, experiences, produces <i>saṁsāra.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_01_devatasamyutta.htm#p56"><i>S.</i> i. 37, 38,</a> <i>satto saṁsāram āpādi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Woodward here has "So he that is followed by this loss through old age...", but the idea is, as above that it is following these losses that some persons give up the world.</p>
