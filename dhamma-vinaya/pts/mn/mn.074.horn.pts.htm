					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha<br />
					on Mount Vulture Peak in the Boar's Cave.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Dīghanakha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					As he was standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					the wanderer Dīghanakha spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, good Gotama, speak thus,<br />
					I am of this view:<br />
					All<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> is not pleasing to me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This view of yours, Aggivessana:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					All is not pleasing to me<br />
					— does this view of yours not please you?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a> "If this view were pleasing to me, good Gotama,<br />
					this would be like it too,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Now, Aggivessana, when those,<br />
					the majority in the world, speak thus:<br />
					'This would be like it too,<br />
					that would be like it too'<br />
					— they do not get rid of that very view,<br />
					and they take up another view.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					— they get rid of that very view<br />

					<p class="f4">There are, Aggivessana,<br />

					some recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br />
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br />
					and are of this view:<br />
					'All is pleasing to me'<br />
					— this view of theirs<br />
					is close to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> attachment,<br />
					close to the fetters,<br />
					close to delight,<br />
					close to cleaving,<br />
					close to grasping.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br />
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br />
					and are of this view:<br />
					'All is not pleasing to me'<br />
					— this view of theirs<br />
					is close to detachment,<br />
					close to the absence of fetters,<br />
					close to the absence of delight,<br />
					close to the absence of cleaving,<br />
					close to the absence of grasping."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the wanderer Dīghanakha spoke thus to the Lord:<br />
					"The good Gotama is complimentary to my view,<br />
					the good Gotama is very complimentary to my view."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, Aggivessana,<br />
					those recluses and brahmans who speak thus<br />
					and are of this view:<br />
					'Part is pleasing to me,<br />
					part is not pleasing to me'<br />
					— that which in this view is pleasing to them<br />
					is close to attachment,<br />
					close to the fetters<br />
					close to delight,<br />
					close to cleaving,<br />
					close to grasping.<br />
					But that which in this view<br />

					is close to detachment,<br />
					close to the absence of fetters<br />
					close to the absence of delight,<br />

					<p class="f4">Concerning those recluses and brahmans, Aggivessana,<br />

					and, obstinately holding to it<br />

					were to say:<br />
					"This is indeed the truth,<br />
					all else is falsehood"<br />
					— there would be for me dispute with two (view-holders):<br />
					both with whatever recluse or brahman speaks thus<br />
					and is of this view:<br />
					"All <a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> is not pleasing to me,"<br />

					<p class="f4">So he, beholding this dispute and contention<br />
					and trouble and vexation for himself,<br />
					gets rid of that very view<br />
					and does not take up another view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is the getting rid of these views,<br />

					broken up and scattered,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">When he regards this body<br />

					whatever in regard to body<br />

					this is got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three feelings, Aggivessana:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling,<br />
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br />
					when one feels a pleasant feeling,<br />
					at that time<br />
					one feels neither a painful feeling<br />
					nor does one feel a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br />
					when one feels a painful feeling,<br />
					at that time<br />

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br />
					when one feels a feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant,<br />
					at that time<br />
					one feels neither a pleasant feeling<br />
					nor does one feel a painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant feelings, Aggivessana,<br />

					liable to stopping.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing it thus, Aggivessana,<br />
					an instructed disciple of the ariyans<br />
					turns away from pleasant feelings<br />
					and he turns away from painful feelings<br />
					and he turns away from feelings that are neither painful nor pleasant;<br />
					turning away he is dispassionate,<br />
					being dispassionate he is freed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in freedom<br />
					the knowledge comes to be that he is freed<br />
					and he comprehends:<br />
					'Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk whose mind is freed thus, Aggivessana,<br />
					does not concur with <a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> anyone,<br />
					he does not dispute with anyone.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					He makes use of the common phrases of the world<br />
					without adhering to them."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Sāriputta <a id="pt501" href="../../pali/mn/mn.073.pali.bd.htm#pg501"><span class="f2">[501]</span></a> was standing behind the Lord,<br />
					fanning the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:<br />
					"The Lord speaks to us<br />
					of getting rid of these things and those<br />
					by means of super-knowledge,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the Well-farer speaks to us<br />
					of casting out these things and those<br />
					by means of super-knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">While the venerable Sāriputta was reflecting on this,<br />
					his mind was freed from the cankers without clinging.<br />
					But to the wanderer Dīghanakha<br />
					there arose the stainless,<br />
					spotless vision of <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					that whatever is of the nature to arise<br />
					all that is of the nature to stop.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Dīghanakha,<br />
					having seen <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					attained <i>dhamma,</i>,<br />
					known <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					plunged into <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					having crossed over doubt,<br />
					having put away uncertainty,<br />
					attaining without another's help<br />
					to full confidence in the Teacher's instruction,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br />
					excellent, good Gotama.<br />
					It is, good Gotama,<br />
					as if one might set upright<br />
					what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose<br />
					what had been covered,<br />
					or point out the Way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp<br />
					into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes<br />
					— even so in many a figure<br />
					has <i>dhamma</i> been made clear by the good Gotama.<br />
					I am going to the revered Gotarna for refuge<br />
					and to <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br />
					as a layfollower going for refuge<br />
					from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>
