					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Dīghanakha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord;<br />

					this is got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three feelings, Aggivessana:<br />
					pleasant feeling,<br />
					painful feeling,<br />
					feeling that is neither painful nor pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br />
					when one feels a pleasant feeling,<br />
					at that time<br />
					one feels neither a painful feeling<br />

					<p class="f4">At the time, Aggivessana,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br />

					<p class="f4">A monk whose mind is freed thus, Aggivessana,<br />
					does not concur with <a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> anyone,<br />
					he does not dispute with anyone.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He makes use of the common phrases of the world<br />
					without adhering to them."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta<br />
					<a id="pt501" href="../../pali/mn/mn.073.pali.bd.htm#pg501"><span class="f2">[501]</span></a> was standing behind the Lord,<br />
					fanning the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Lord speaks to us<br />
					of getting rid of these things and those<br />
					by means of super-knowledge,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the Well-farer speaks to us<br />
					of casting out these things and those<br />
					by means of super-knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">While the venerable Sāriputta was reflecting on this,<br />
					his mind was freed from the cankers without clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">But to the wanderer Dīghanakha<br />
					there arose the stainless,<br />
					spotless vision of <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					that whatever is of the nature to arise<br />
					all that is of the nature to stop.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wanderer Dīghanakha,<br />
					having seen <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					attained <i>Dhamma,</i>,<br />
					known <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					plunged into <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					having crossed over doubt,<br />
					having put away uncertainty,<br />
					attaining without another's help<br />
					to full confidence in the Teacher's instruction,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br />
					excellent, good Gotama.<br />
					It is, good Gotama,<br />
					as if one might set upright<br />
					what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose<br />
					what had been covered,<br />
					or point out the Way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp<br />
					into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes<br />
					— even so in many a figure<br />
					has <i>Dhamma</i> been made clear by the good Gotama.<br />
					I am going to the revered Gotarna for refuge<br />
					and to <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br />
					as a layfollower going for refuge<br />
					from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>
