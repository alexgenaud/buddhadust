					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna, Samaṇamaṇḍikā's son,<br />
					was staying in the One Hall,<br />
					set round with a row of tinduka trees,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in Malhkā's park<br />
					which was intended for discussion,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					together with a company of wanderers<br />
					numbering at least three hundred.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then early one morning the carpenter Pancakaŋga left Sāvatthī<br />
					so as to see the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to Pancakaŋga the carpenter:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not yet the right time to see the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord has withdrawn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it the season<br />
					to see the monks who are developing their minds.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The monks who are developing their minds<br />
					have withdrawn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that I were to approach Mallikā's park,<br />
					which is intended for discussion,<br />
					the One Hall,<br />
					set round with a row of tinduka trees,<br />
					and Uggāhamāna the wanderer, Samaṇamaṇḍikā's son?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> Pancakaŋga the carpenter approached Mallikā's park,<br />
					which is intended for discussion,<br />
					the One Hall,<br />
					set round with a row of tinduka trees,<br />
					and Uggāhamāna the wanderer, Samaṇamaṇḍikā's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Uggāhamāna was sitting down<br />
					with a great company of wanderers<br />
					shouting out with a loud noise,<br />
					a great noise,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					talking various kinds of inferior talk<br />
					that is to say<br />
					talk on kings,<br />
					thieves,<br />
					great ministers,<br />
					armies,<br />
					fears,<br />
					battles,<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					scents,<br />
					relations,<br />
					vehicles,<br />
					villages,<br />
					market towns,<br />
					towns,<br />
					the country,<br />
					women,<br />
					heroes,<br />
					streets,<br />
					wells,<br />
					those departed before,<br />
					talk of diversity,<br />
					speculation about the world,<br />
					speculation about the sea,<br />
					talk about becoming or not becoming<br />
					thus or thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uggāhamāna saw the carpenter Pancakaŋga coming in the distance;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he called his own company to order,<br />
					saying;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good sirs, let there be little noise;<br />
					do not, good sirs, make a noise;<br />
					this is a disciple of the recluse Gotama who is coming -<br />
					the carpenter Pancakaŋga.</p>

					<p class="f4">For as long as white-frocked householders,<br />
					disciples of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					have been staying at Sāvatthī,<br />
					the carpenter Pancakaŋga has been among them.</p>

					<p class="f4">These venerable ones wish for little noise,<br />
					they are trained to little noise,<br />
					they are praisers of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, if he knows that this is a company of little noise,<br />
					he may consider approaching."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pancakaŋga the carpenter<br />
					approached Uggāhamāna;<br />
					having approached<br />
					he exchanged greetings with Uggāhamāna;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uggāhamāna spoke thus to Pancakaŋga the carpenter<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, carpenter, lay down<br />
					that an individual who is endowed with four qualities<br />
					is abounding in skill,<br />
					of the highest skill,<br />
					an unconquerable recluse<br />
					attained to the utmost attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">With what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, carpenter,<br />
					he does no evil deed with his body,<br />
					he speaks no evil speech,<br />
					he intends no evil intention,<br />
					he leads no evil mode of livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">I lay down, carpenter,<br />
					that if an individual is endowed with these four qualities<br />
					he is abounding in skill,<br />
					of the highest skill,<br />
					an unconquerable recluse<br />
					attained to the utmost attainments."</p>

					<p class="f4">But the carpenter Pancakaŋga<br />
					neither rejoiced in what Uggāhamāna had said<br />
					nor scoffed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither rejoicing nor scoffing,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					he departed,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will discover the meaning of what was said<br />
					in the Lord's presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pancakaŋga the carpenter<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he ivas sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					Pancakaŋga the carpenter told the Lord<br />
					the whole of the conversation he had had with Uggāhamāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, the Lord spoke thus to Pancakaŋga the carpenter:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This being so, carpenter,<br />
					then according to the speech of Uggāhamāna<br />
					a young baby boy<br />
					lying on its back<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> would be of <a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> abounding skill,<br />
					of the highest skill,<br />
					an unconquerable recluse<br />
					attained to the utmost attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, carpenter,<br />
					a young baby boy lying on its back<br />
					does not think of its own body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">How then could it do an evil deed with its body,<br />
					except for a little kicking about?</p>

					<p class="f4">A young baby boy, carpenter,<br />
					lying on its back<br />
					does not think of its own voice.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then could it utter an evil speech,<br />
					except for a little crying?</p>

					<p class="f4">A young baby boy, carpenter,<br />
					lying on its back<br />
					does not think about its own intention.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then could it intend an evil intention,<br />
					except for a little excitement?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A young baby boy, carpenter,<br />
					lying on its back<br />
					does not think of its own mode of livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then could it lead an evil mode of livelihood,<br />

					<p class="f4">This being so, carpenter,<br />
					then according to the speech of Uggāhamāna<br />
					a young baby boy lying on its back<br />
					would be of abounding skill,<br />
					of the highest skill,<br />
					an unconquerable recluse<br />
					attained to the utmost attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I, carpenter, lay down<br />
					that an individual,<br />
					endowed with four qualities,<br />
					is neither of abounding skill<br />
					nor of the highest skill<br />
					nor is he an unconquerable recluse<br />

					<p class="f4">With what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, carpenter,<br />
					he does no evil deed with his body,<br />
					he utters no evil speech,<br />
					he intends no evil intention,<br />

					<p class="f4">I, carpenter, lay down<br />

					<p class="f4">I, carpenter, lay down<br />
					that an individual,<br />

					attained to the utmost attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is to be understood for him,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> carpenter,<br />

					<p class="f4">And faring along in what way, carpenter,<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, carpenter,<br />

					<p class="f4">And endowed with what ten qualities<br />
