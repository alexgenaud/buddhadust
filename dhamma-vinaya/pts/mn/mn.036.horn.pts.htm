					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Great Grove in the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Lord came to be fully clothed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in the morning<br />
					and, taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					wished to enter Vesālī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					who was always pacing up and down,<br />
					always roaming about on foot,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					approached the Great Grove<br />
					and the hall of the Gabled House.</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Ānanda saw Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					coming in the distance;<br />
					having seen him,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this Saccaka, the son of Jains, is coming,<br />
					a controversialist,<br />
					giving himself out as learned,<br />
					much honoured by the manyfolk.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He, Lord, desires dispraise of the Awakened One,<br />
					dispraise of <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					dispraise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good, Lord,<br />
					if the Lord were to sit down for a moment<br />
					out of compassion."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down on an appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Saccaka, the son of Jains, approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Saccaka, the son of Jains, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> There are, good Gotama, some recluses and brahmans,<br />
					who dwell intent on the development of body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					not on the development of mind.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">They acquire, good Gotama,<br />
					a feeling of physical pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">If once upon a time, good Gotama,<br />
					there had been acquired a feeling of physical pain,<br />
					there may be paralysis of the legs,<br />
					and the heart may burst,<br />
					and warm blood may issue from the mouth,<br />
					or one may come to madness,<br />
					to mind-tossing.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This comes to be for one, good Gotama,<br />
					when the mind conforms to the body,<br />
					when it is under the rule of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the non-development of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there are, good Gotama, some recluses and brahmans<br />
					who live intent on the development of mind,<br />
					not on the development of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">They acquire, good Gotama,<br />
					a feeling of mental pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">If once upon a time, good Gotama,<br />
					there had been acquired a feeling of mental pain,<br />
					there may be a paralysis of the legs,<br />
					and the heart may burst,<br />
					and warm blood may issue from the mouth,<br />
					or one may come to madness,<br />
					to mind-tossing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This comes to be for one, good Gotama,<br />
					whose body conforms to mind,<br />
					is under the rule of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the non-development of body."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what have you, Aggivessana,<br />
					heard about the development of body?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saŋkicca, Makkhali of the Cowpen<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					these, good Gotama, are unclothed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					flouting life's decencies,<br />
					licking (their hands after meals),<br />
					not those to come<br />
					when asked to do so,<br />
					not those to stand still<br />
					when asked to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not consent (to accept food)<br />
					offered to (them)<br />
					or specially prepared for (them),<br />
					nor to (accept) an invitation (to a meal).</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not accept food<br />
					straight from the cooking pot or pan,<br />
					nor within the threshould,<br />
					nor among the faggots,<br />
					nor among the rice- <a id="pg293"><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></a> pounders,<br />
					nor when two people were eating,<br />
					nor from a pregnant woman,<br />
					nor from one giving suck,<br />
					nor from one co-habiting with a man,<br />
					nor from gleanings,<br />
					nor near where a dog is standing,<br />
					nor where flies are swarming,<br />
					nor fish,<br />
					nor meat.</p>

					<p class="f4">They drink neither fermented liquor<br />
					nor spirits<br />
					nor rice-gruel.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are one-house-men,<br />
					a one-piece-men,<br />
					or a two-house-men,<br />
					a two-piece-men<br />
					or a three-house-men,<br />
					a three-piece-men<br />
					or a four-house-men,<br />
					a four-piece-men<br />
					or a five-house-men,<br />
					a five-piece-men<br />
					or a six-house-men,<br />
					a six-piece-men<br />
					or a seven-house-men,<br />
					a seven-piece-men.</p>

					<p class="f4">They subsist on one little offering,<br />
					they subsist on two little offerings<br />
					they subsist on three little offerings<br />
					they subsist on four little offerings<br />
					they subsist on five little offerings<br />
					they subsist on six little offerings<br />
					they subsist on seven little offerings.</p>

					<p class="f4">They take food only once a day,<br />
					and they take food once in two days<br />
					and they take food once in three days<br />
					and they take food once in four days<br />
					and they take food once in five days<br />
					and they take food once in six days<br />
					and they take food once in seven days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they live intent on the practice<br />
					of eating rice at regular fort-nightly intervals.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But do they, Aggivessana, keep going on so little?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now and then they eat very good solid food,<br />
					partake of very good soft food,<br />
					savour very good savourings,<br />
					drink very good drinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">They build up their bodily strength with these,<br />
					make their bodies grow and become fat."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, Aggivessana, attend later<br />
					to what they had eschewed earlier;<br />
					thus there is increase and loss for that body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But what have you, Aggivessana,<br />
					heard about the development of mind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					on being questioned by the Lord<br />
					on the development of mind,<br />
					did not succeed (in replying).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Saccaka, the son of Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That which was first spoken of by you, Aggivessana,<br />
					as the development of the body,<br />
					that, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br />
					is not the proper development of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">For you, Aggivessana,<br />
					do not know what is development of the body,<br />
					so how can you know<br />
					what is development of the mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, Aggivessana, hear how there comes to be<br />
					one who is not developed as to body<br />
					and not developed as to mind,<br />
					developed as to body<br />
					and developed as to mind;<br />
					pay careful attention<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Aggivessana, does one come to be<br />
					not developed as to body<br />
					and not developed as to mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana,<br />
					a pleasurable feeling arises in an uninstructed ordinary man;<br />
					he, being assailed by the pleasurable feeling,<br />
					becomes addicted to pleasure<br />
					and falls into addiction for pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">If that pleasurable feeling of his is stopped,<br />
					a painful feeling arises from the stopping <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> of the pleasurable feeling;<br />
					he, being assailed by the painful feeling,<br />
					grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />
					beats his breast<br />
					and falls into disillusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">This pleasurable feeling, Aggivessana,<br />
					that has arisen in him,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					persists,<br />
					because of the non-development of body;<br />
					and the painful feeling that has arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					persists,<br />
					because of the non-development of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">In anyone in whom, Aggivessana,<br />
					there are these two alternatives thus:<br />
					a pleasurable feeling that has arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					persists,<br />
					because of the non-development of body;<br />
					and a painful feeling that has arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					persists,<br />
					because of the non-development of mind -<br />
					he thus comes to be, Aggivessana,<br />
					not developed as to body<br />
					and not developed as to mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does there come to be, Aggivessana,<br />
					one who is both developed as to body<br />
					and developed as to mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Aggivessana, a pleasurable feeling arises<br />
					in an instructed disciple of the ariyans;<br />
					he, being assailed by the pleasurable feeling,<br />
					does not become addicted to pleasure<br />
					nor does he fall into addiction to pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">If that pleasurable feeling of his is stopped<br />
					and a painful feeling arises<br />
					from the stopping of that pleasurable feeling,<br />
					he, being assailed by the painful feeling,<br />
					does not grieve,<br />
					mourn,<br />
					lament,<br />
					he does not beat his breast,<br />
					he does not fall into disillusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">This pleasurable feeling, Aggivessana,<br />
					that has arisen in him,<br />
					impinging on his mind,<br />
					does not persist,<br />
					because of the development of the body;<br />
					and the painful feeling that has arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					does not persist,<br />
					because of the development of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">In anyone in whom, Aggivessana,<br />
					there are these two alternatives thus:<br />
					a pleasurable feeling that has arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					does not persist,<br />
					because of the development of body;<br />
					and a painful feeling that has arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					does not persist,<br />
					because of the development of mind -<br />
					he thus comes to be, Aggivessana,<br />
					both developed as to body<br />
					and developed as to mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"A believer thus am I<br />
					in the revered Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the revered Gotama<br />
					is both developed as to body<br />
					and developed as to mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This speech spoken by you, Aggivessana,<br />
					is offensive and presumptuous,<br />
					but yet will I answer you.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I, Aggivessana, had had the hair of my head and beard shaved,<br />
					and had clothed myself in saffron garments<br />
					and had gone forth from home into homelessness -<br />
					that a pleasurable feeling arisen in me,<br />
					impinging on my mind,<br />
					could persist,<br />
					or that a painful feeling arisen,<br />
					impinging on my mind,<br />
					could persist,<br />
					such a situation could not occur."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> "Is it then that a pleasurable feeling<br />
					has not arisen in the good Gotama<br />
					of such a nature that,<br />
					having arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					it could not persist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it then that a painful feeling<br />
					has not arisen in the good Gotama<br />
					of such a nature that,<br />
					having arisen,<br />
					impinging on the mind,<br />
					it could not persist?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How could this not be, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Aggivessana, before my Self-awakening<br />
					while I was still the bodhisatta,<br />
					not fully awakened,<br />
					it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Narrow is the household life,<br />
					a path of dust,<br />
					going forth is in the open,<br />
					nor is it easy while dwelling in a house<br />
					to lead the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled,<br />
					utterly purified,<br />
					polished like a conch-shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I,<br />
					having cut off hair and beard,<br />
					having clothed myself in saffron garments,<br />
					should go forth from home into homelessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, alter a time,<br />
					being young,<br />
					my hair coal-black,<br />
					possessed of radiant youth,<br />
					in the prime of my life —<br />
					although my unwilling parents wept and wailed —<br />
					having cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					having put on yellow robes,<br />
					went forth from home into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, being gone forth thus,<br />
					a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, reverend Kālāma, want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Aggivessana, Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br />
					this dhamma is such<br />
					that an intelligent man,<br />
					having soon realised super-knowledge for himself<br />
					(as learnt from) his own teacher,<br />
					may enter on and abide in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana,<br />
					very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					mastered that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, Aggivessana, as far as mere lip service,<br />
					mere repetition<br />
					were concerned,<br />
					spoke the doctrine of knowledge,<br />
					and the doctrine of the elders,<br />
					and I claimed —<br />
					I as well as others —<br />
					that 'I know, I see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But Āḷāra the Kālāma does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br />
					simply out of faith:<br />
					Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					I am abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing,<br />
					seeing this dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, Aggivessana, approach Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for yourself,<br />
					entering thereon,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Aggivessana,<br />
					Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.<br />
					It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy,<br />
					I too have energy.<br />
					It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness,<br />
					I too have mindfulness.<br />
					It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration,<br />
					I too have concentration.<br />
					It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma<br />
					which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it I am abiding therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on that dhamma,<br />
					abided therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Aggivessana, approached Āḷāra the Kālāma;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it to this extent that you, reverend Kalama,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is to this extent that I, your reverence,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br />
					having realised this dhamma by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					am abiding in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br />
					it is well gotten for us, your reverence,<br />
					that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer<br />
					such as the venerable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that you, entering on,<br />
					are abiding in,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge;<br />
					the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that you know.<br />
					The dhamma that you know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br />
					being just the two of us,<br />
					let us look after this group.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Aggivessana, did Āḷāra the Kālāma,<br />
					being my teacher,<br />
					set me<br />
					— the pupil —<br />
					on the same level as himself<br />
					and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br />
					nor to dispassion<br />
					nor to stopping<br />
					nor to tranquillity<br />
					nor to super-knowledge<br />
					nor to awakening<br />
					nor to Nibbāna,<br />
					but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana,<br />
					not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, monka, a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, your reverence, want to fare the Brahmā-faring<br />
					in this dhamma and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Aggivessana, Uddaka, Rāma's son, spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable one proceed;<br />
					this dhamma is such<br />
					that an intelligent man,<br />
					having soon realised super-knowledge for himself,<br />

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />

					<p class="f4">I, Aggivessana, as far as mere lip service,<br />

					'I know,<br />
					I see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But Uddahka, Rāma's son, does not merely proclaim this dhamma<br />
					simply out of faith:<br />
					Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					I am abiding in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />
					proceeds knowing and seeing this dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did I, Aggivessana, approach Uddaka, Rāma's;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what extent do you, reverend Rāma,<br />

					proclaim this dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Aggivessana,<br />
					Uddahka, Rāma's son, proclaimed the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not only  Rāma who has faith,<br />
					I too have faith.<br />

					It is not only  Rāma who has concentration,<br />
					I too have concentration.<br />
					It is not only Rāma who has intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I too have intuitive wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma<br />
					which Rāma proclaims:<br />
					'Having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					I am abiding in it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, very soon,<br />
					very quickly,<br />
					having realised super-knowledge for myself,<br />
					entering on that dhamma,<br />
					abided therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Aggivessana, approached Uddaka, Rāma's son;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it to this extent that you, reverend Rāma,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is to this extent that I, your reverence,<br />
					proclaim this dhamma,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I too, your reverence,<br />
					having realised this dhamma by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					entering on it am abiding in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is profitable for us,<br />
					it is well gotten by us, your reverence,<br />
					that we see a fellow-Brahmā-farer<br />
					such as the venerable one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge;<br />
					the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in,<br />
					having realised it by your own super-knowledge,<br />
					is the dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim,<br />
					having realised it by my own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dhamma that I know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that you know.</p>

					<p class="f4">That dhamma that you know,<br />
					this is the dhamma that I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, your reverence,<br />
					being just the two of us,<br />
					let us look after this group.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Aggivessana, did Uddaka, Rāma's son,<br />
					being my teacher, set me<br />
					— the pupil —<br />
					on the same level as himself<br />
					and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to me, monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This dhamma does not conduce to disregard<br />
					nor to dispassion<br />
					nor to stopping<br />
					nor to tranquillity<br />
					nor to super-knowledge<br />
					nor to awakening<br />
					nor to Nibbāna,<br />
					but only as far as reaching the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, not getting enough from this dhamma,<br />
					disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Aggivessana, a quester for whatever is good,<br />
					searching for the incomparable,<br />
					matchless path to peace,<br />
					walking on tour through Magadha<br />
					in due course arrived at Uruvela,<br />
					the camp township.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I saw a delightful stretch of land<br />
					and a lovely woodland grove,<br />
					and a clear flowing river<br />
					with a delightful ford,<br />
					and a village for support nearby.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to me, Aggivessana:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it it is a delightful stretch of land,<br />
					and the woodland grove is lovely,<br />
					and the river flows clear<br />
					with a delightful ford,<br />
					and there is a village for support nearby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed this does well for the striving<br />
					of a young man set on striving.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, sat down just there thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed this does well for striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> Aggivessana,<br />

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick,<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, Aggivessana, men,<br />
					having seen me,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is black.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Other men spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br />
					<a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> the recluse Gotama is deep brown.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some men spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is not black,<br />
					he is not even deep brown,<br />
					the recluse Gotama is of a sallow colour.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">To such an extent, Aggivessana,<br />
					was my clear pure complexion<br />
					spoilt because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Aggivessana, occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Some recluses and brahmans<br />
					in the past<br />
					have experienced feelings that were acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br />
					in the future<br />
					will experience feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some recluses and brahmans<br />
					are now<br />
					experiencing feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe;<br />
					but this is paramount,<br />
					nor is there worse than this.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I,<br />
					by this severe austerity,<br />
					do not reach states of further-men,<br />
					the excellent knowledge and vision<br />
					befitting the ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be another way to awakening?</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Aggivessana, occurred to me:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>This was no ordinary plowing! This was the spring plowing festival day, a fertility rite, and also the day of Gotama's reaching manhood. With the young Gotama sitting apart at peace under the apple tree, this becomes significant symbolism of a state separated from pleasures of the senses.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">'I know that while my father, the Sakyan,<br />
					was ploughing,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering on the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful,<br />
					and while abiding therein,<br />
					I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now could this be a way to awakening?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, following on my mindfulness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> Aggivessana,<br />
					there was the consciousness:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is itself the Way to awakening.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Aggivessana:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, am I afraid of that happiness<br />
					which is happiness<br />
					apart from sense-pleasures,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Aggivessana:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not afraid of that happiness<br />
					which is happiness<br />
					apart from sense-pleasures,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This occurred to me, Aggivessana:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now it is not easy to reach that happiness<br />
					by thus subjecting the body<br />
					to extreme emaciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to take material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, Aggivessana, took material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time, Aggivessana,<br />
					five monks<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> were attending me<br />
					and (they thought):</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the recluse <a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> Gotama wins <i>dhamma</i><br />
					he will announce it to us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Aggivessana, took material nourishment -<br />
					boiled rice<br />
					and sour milk -<br />
					then these five monks turned on me in disgust,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama lives in abundance,<br />
					he is wavering in his striving,<br />
					he has reverted to a life of abundance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I, Aggivessana, had taken some material nourishment,<br />
					having picked up strength,<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Aggivessana, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Aggivessana, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture<br />
					I dwelt with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and I experienced in my person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and I entered on<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Aggivessana, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of joy<br />
					and by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					I entered into<br />
					and abided in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Aggivessana, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the mind composed thus,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge and recollection<br />
					of former habitations:</p>

					<p class="f4">I remembered a variety of former habitations, thus:<br />
					one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration;<br />
					such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so was I nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I remember divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Aggivessana,<br />
					was the first knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the first watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the passing hence<br />
					and the arising of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					I see beings as they pass hence<br />
					or come to be;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds,<br />
					and I think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech,<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in speech,<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					do I see beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					I comprehend that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Aggivessana,<br />
					was the second knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the middle watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with the mind composed<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					fixed,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					I directed my mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is anguish,<br />
					this is the arising of anguish,<br />
					this is the stopping of anguish,<br />
					this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">I understood as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the cankers,<br />
					this is the arising of the cankers,<br />
					this is the stopping of the cankers,<br />
					this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing this thus,<br />
					seeing thus,<br />
					my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of sense-pleasures,<br />
					and my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of becoming,<br />
					and my mind was freed<br />
					from the canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom<br />
					the knowledge came to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am freed;</p>

					<p class="f4">and I comprehended:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close is the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or such.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Aggivessana,<br />
					was the third knowledge attained by me<br />
					in the last watch of the night;<br />
					ignorance was dispelled,<br />
					knowledge arose,<br />
					darkness was dispelled,<br />
					light arose<br />
					even as I abided diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute.</p>

					<p class="f4">But yet, Aggivessana, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me,<br />
					persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I, Aggivessana, am aware<br />
					that when I am teaching <i>dhamma</i><br />
					to companies consisting of many hundreds,<br />
					each person thinks thus about me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The recluse Gotama is teaching <i>dhamma</i> especially for me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But this, Aggivessana, should not be understood thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">For when a Tathāgata is teaching <i>dhamma</i> to others<br />
					it is for the sake of general instruction.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, Aggivessana, at the close of such a talk,<br />
					steady,<br />
					calm,<br />
					make one-pointed<br />
					and concentrate my mind subjectively<br />
					in that first characteristic of concentration<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in which I ever constantly abide."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is to believed of the good Gotama,<br />
					for he is a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But does the good Gotama allow<br />
					that he sleeps during the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> "I allow, Aggivessana, that<br />
					during the last month of the hot weather,<br />
					returning from alms-gathering after the meal,<br />
					having laid down the outer cloak (folded) into four,<br />
					mindful and clearly conscious,<br />
					I fall asleep on my right side."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But this, good Gotama,<br />
					is what some recluses and brahmans call<br />
					'abiding in confusion.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So far, Aggivessana,<br />
					there is neither bewilderment<br />
					nor non-bewilderment.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Aggivessana,<br />
					how there is bewilderment and non-bewilderment -<br />
					listen to it,<br />
					pay careful attention,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />
					answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In whoever, Aggivessana,<br />
					those cankers are not got rid of<br />
					that have to do with the defilements,<br />

					that are fearful,<br />

					ageing<br />
					and dying<br />
					in the future<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					him I call bewildered.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whoever, Aggivessana,<br />
					those cankers are got rid of<br />
					which are connected with the defilements,<br />
					with again-becoming,<br />
					that are fearful,<br />
					whose result is anguish,<br />
					making for birth,<br />
					ageing<br />
					and dying<br />
					in the future -<br />
					him I call unbewildered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those cankers of the <i>Tathāgata</i>, Aggivessana,<br />
					that are connected with the defilements,<br />
					with again-becoming,<br />
					that are fearful,<br />
					whose result is anguish,<br />
					making for birth,<br />
					ageing<br />
					and dying<br />
					in the future,<br />
					these are got rid of,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump<br />
					so that they can come<br />
					to no further existence in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as, Aggivessana,<br />
					a palm-tree whose crown is cut off<br />
					cannot come to further growth,<br />
					even so, Aggivessana,<br />
					got rid of,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump<br />
					so that they can come<br />
					to no further existence in the future<br />
					are those cankers of the Tathāgata<br />

					with again-becoming,<br />
					that are fearful,<br />
					whose result is anguish,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Saccaka, the son of Jains,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, good Gotama,<br />
