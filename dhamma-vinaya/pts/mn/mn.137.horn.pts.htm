					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> These three <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> have nothing to do with the four usual ones, as is clear from the analysis <a href="#pg269">below, p. 269.</a> They are, more precisely, <i>āveṇikā</i> (special, exceptional) <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> of a Buddha, his even-mindedness, <i>sama-cittatā,</i> when his audience listens, does not listen, or partly both. See <i>B.H.S.D.</i> under āveṇika and <i>sm.rty-upasthāna.</i> At <i>Divy.</i> 182, 268, we get: <i>tribhir āveṇikaiḥ sm.rtyupasthānair;</i> and at <i>Divy.</i> 126 <i>tribhiḥ sm.rtyupasthānair</i> <i>Cf.</i> the eighteen special, peculiar attributes of a Buddha, <i>āveṇikā Buddha-dharmā,</i> enumerated at <i>Mhvu.</i> i. 160. And <i>cf.</i> <i>e.g..</i> <i>Śatasāhasrikā</i> ix. 1449-1450 (translated at <i>Buddhist Texts through the Ages,</i> p. 146) where among the attributes is included "his mindfulness never fails" and "there is no falling off in mindfulness," <i>nāsti sm.rtihāniḥ,</i> although this, from the context, almost certainly refers not to the three, but to the four arousings of mindfulness. Pali has no such list, although eighteen <i>Buddhadhammā</i> are referred to at <i>Miln.</i> 105, 285, <i>UdA.</i> 87. Apart from the above Discourse, I know of no other passage in the Pali canon that expounds these three <i>satipaṭṭhāna.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>tayo satipaṭṭhānā, yad ariyo sevati yad ariyo sevamāno satthā gaṇaɱ anusāsituɱ arahati.</i> The two occurrences of <i>yad</i> in this sentence have the effect of referring not to these three <i>satipaṭṭhānā</i> as a whole or unit but to whichever one of them is called forth by the circumstances: of the disciples listening, not listening, or some listening and some not; see previous note. Also see the gloss of <i>yad ariyo</i> at <i>MA.</i> v. 27: <i>yad ariyo ti ye satipaṭṭhāne ariyo sammāsambuddho sevati. Tattha tīsu ṭhānesu ṭhapento satipaṭṭhāne sevatī ti veditabbo:</i> "which an ariyan" means those arousings of mindfulness which an ariyan who is a fully self-awakened one practises. Here it is to be understood that, setting up mindfulness in the three (sets of) circumstances, he practises the arousings of mindfulness.</p>
