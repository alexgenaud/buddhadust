					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is as if there were two houses with doors<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and a man with vision<br />
					standing there between them<br />
					might see people entering a house<br />
					and leaving it<br />
					and going back and forth<br />
					and walking across.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so do I, monks,<br />
					with the purified deva-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					see beings as they are passing hence,<br />
					as they are coming to be,<br />
					and see<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of deeds,<br />
					(and I think):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed these worthy beings,<br />
					who are endowed with right conduct in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					who are not scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					are of right view,<br />
					incurring kamma consequent on right view,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					are arising in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or these worthy beings,<br />
					who are endowed with right conduct in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					who are not scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					are of right view,<br />

					and thought,<br />
					who are scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					are of false view,<br />

					<p class="f4">Or these worthy beings,<br />

					who are scoffers at the ariyans,<br />

					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					are arising in the sorrowful ways,<br />
					the bad bourn,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					Niraya Hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the guardians of Niraya Hell,<br />

					no respect for his father,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Let your majesty decree a punishment for him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, King Yama cross-questions him,<br />

					<p class="f4">He speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I was not able to, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Those that do evil deeds in the world<br />

					<p class="f4">0 that I might acquire human status<br />
					and that a <a id="pg230"><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></a> Tathāāgata might arise in the world,<br />
					a perfected one,<br />
					a fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					and that I might wait on that Lord,<br />
					and that that Lord might teach me <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					and that I might understand that Lord's <i>dhamma</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4">What I am talking about, monks,<br />
					I have heard from no other recluse or brahman;<br />
					and moreover<br />
					what I am talking about<br />
					is known only by me myself,<br />
					seen by myself,<br />
					discerned by myself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Well-farer had said this,<br />
					the Teacher further spoke thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"If young men, warned by <i>deva</i>-messengers, are indolent,<br />
							For a long time they grieve - men going to lowly assemblies.<br />
							But those who here are truly men, when warned by <i>deva-</i>messengers<br />
							Are never indolent in the ariyan <i>dhamma</i>;<br />
							Seeing peril in grasping, in the origin of birth and dying,<br />
							They are freed without grasping through the destruction of birth and dying.<br />
							These, attaining security, happy, here and now perfectly allayed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Outstripping all hatred and fear, pass beyond all anguish."</p>
