					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near Aŋguttarāpa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Āpaṇa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> was a market town in Aŋguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Āpaṇa for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had walked for almsfood in Āpaṇa<br />
					and was returning from the alms-gathering after the meal,<br />
					he approached a certain forest-thicket for the day-sojoum;<br />
					and having plunged into that forest-thicket<br />
					he sat down at the root of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the householder Potaliya,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who was constantly pacing up and down<br />
					and roaming about on foot,<br />
					fully dressed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and clothed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with parasol and slippers,<br />
					approached that forest-thicket;<br />
					having plunged into that forest-thicket,<br />
					he approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the householder Potaliya<br />
					as he was standing at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are seats, householder;<br />
					if you wish,<br />
					do sit down."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the householder Potaliya<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br />
					with the word 'householder'",<br />
					angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are <a id="pg26"><span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span></a> seats, householder;<br />
					if you wish,<br />
					do sit down."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time<br />
					the householder Potaliya<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br />
					with the word 'householder'",<br />
					angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the householder Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are seats, householder;<br />
					if you wish,<br />
					do sit down."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the householder Potaliya<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The recluse Gotama addresses me<br />
					with the word 'householder'",<br />
					angry,<br />
					displeased,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This,<a id="pt360" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg360"><span class="f2">[360]</span></a>good Gotama, is not proper,<br />
					it is not suitable,<br />
					that you should address me<br />
					with the word 'householder.' "</p>

					<p class="f4">"But you, householder,<br />
					have all the characteristic marks and signs<br />
					of a householder."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But all relevant occupations<br />
					have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,<br />
					all avocations given up."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, householder,<br />
					how have all occupations been abandoned by you,<br />
					all avocations given up?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, good Gotama,<br />
					I handed over to my sons<br />
					as their inheritance<br />
					all that I had of wealth<br />
					or grain<br />
					or silver<br />
					or gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without giving advice or blame in these matters<br />
					I live on a minimum<br />
					of food and covering.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is how all occupations have been abandoned by me, good Gotama,<br />
					all avocations given up."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what you, householder, call<br />
					a giving up of avocations<br />
					is one thing;<br />
					but in the discipline for an ariyan<br />
					the giving up of avocations<br />
					is another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, revered sir,<br />
					is the giving up of avocations<br />
					in the discipline for an ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, revered sir,<br />
					if the Lord were to teach me dhamma<br />
					as to that which is the giving up of avocations<br />
					in the discipline for an ariyan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householder, listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, these eight things<br />
					conduce to the giving up of avocations<br />
					in the discipline for an ariyan.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Through no onslaught on creatures,<br />

					<p class="f4">through taking what is given,<br />

					<p class="f4">through non-covetise and greed,<br />
					covetise and greed should be got rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through no angry fault-finding,<br />
					angry fault-finding should be got <a id="pg27"><span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span></a> rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through no wrathful rage,<br />
					wrathful rage should be got rid of;</p>

					<p class="f4">through no arrogance,<br />
					arrogance should be got rid of.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the eight things, householder,<br />
					spoken of in brief,<br />
					not explained in detail,<br />
					that, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br />
					conduce to the giving up of avocations."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to these eight things, revered sir,<br />
					which are spoken of in brief,<br />
					not explained in detail,<br />
					and which, in the discipline for an ariyan,<br />
					conduce to the giving up of avocations,<br />
					it were good, revered sir,<br />
					if the Lord<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					were to explain these eight things to me in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householder, listen,<br />
					attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					the householder Potaliya answered the Lord in assent.</p>
