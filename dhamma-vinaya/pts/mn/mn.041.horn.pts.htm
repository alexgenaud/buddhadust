					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Lord,<br />
					walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans named Sālā.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman householders of Sālā heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is said that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan family,<br />
					and walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					has reached Sālā,<br />
					and that a lovely reputation has gone forth about the Lord Gotama thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br />
					he makes known this world<br />
					together with devas<br />
					including the Māras and the Brahmās;<br />
					creatures<br />
					together with recluses and brahmans,<br />
					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>dhamma</i><br />
					that is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle<br />
					and lovely at the ending;<br />
					he explains with the spirit and the letter<br />
					the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled<br />
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br />
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman householders of Sālā approached the Lord;<br />
					some, having approached, having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, becoming silent,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the brahman householders of Sālā spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what is the cause, good Gotama,<br />
					what is the reason why some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause,<br />
					what is the reason, good Gotama,<br />
					why some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householders, some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise thus in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					<a id="pg344"><span class="f2 g"><b>[344]</b></span></a> Niraya Hell<br />
					because of faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					an uneven faring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise thus in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven-world,<br />
					because of faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					an even faring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"We do not understand in full<br />
					the matter that has been spoken of in brief by the good Gotama,<br />
					and whose meaning was not explained in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good if the good Gotama were so to teach us <i>dhamma</i><br />
					that we might understand in full<br />
					the matter spoken of in brief by the good Gotama,<br />
					and whose meaning was not explained in full."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householders, listen,<br />
					pay careful attention,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," these brahman householders of Sālā answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Threefold, householders,<br />
					is the faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					an uneven faring as to body;<br />
					fourfold is the faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					an uneven faring as to speech;<br />
					threefold is the faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					and uneven faring as to thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by not <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring as to body?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> householders,<br />
					a certain one makes onslaught on creatures,<br />
					he is cruel,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					intent on injuring and killing,<br />
					without mercy to living creatures.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He is a taker of what is not given;<br />
					whatever property of another<br />
					in village or jungle<br />
					is not given to him<br />
					he takes by theft.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a wrong-goer in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br />
					he has intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					protected by the father,<br />
					protected by the parents,<br />
					protected by a brother,<br />
					protected by a sister,<br />
					protected by relations,<br />
					who have a husband,<br />
					whose use involves punishments,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and even with those adorned with garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders,<br />
					is the threefold faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring, in regard to the body.</p>

					<p>And how, householders, does there come to be the fourfold faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring as to speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders,<br />
					a certain one is of lying speech;<br />
					when he is cited and asked as a witness<br />
					before a council<br />
					or company<br />
					or amid <a id="pg345"><span class="f2 g"><b>[345]</b></span></a> his relations<br />
					or amid a guild<br />
					or amid a royal family,<br />
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, good man, say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he does not know, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he knows, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know';</p>

					<p class="f4">although he has not seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I saw,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he has seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech becomes intentional lying<br />
					either for his own sake<br />
					or for the sake of another<br />
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a slanderer;<br />
					having heard something at one place,<br />
					he makes it known elsewhere<br />
					for (causing) variance among those (people);<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he makes it known among these people<br />
					for (causing) variance among these (people).</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he sows discord among those who are in harmony,<br />
					or is one who foments those who are at variance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Discord is his pleasure,<br />
					discord his delight,<br />
					discord his joy,<br />
					discord is the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is one of harsh speech.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is rough,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					hard,<br />
					severe on others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					bordering on wrath,<br />
					not conducive to concentration,<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a frivolous chatterer,<br />
					one who speaks at a wrong time,<br />
					one who does not speak in accordance with fact,<br />
					one who speaks about what is not the goal,<br />
					one who speaks about not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					one who speaks about not-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is not worth treasuring;<br />
					owing to its being at the wrong time<br />
					it is incongruous,<br />
					has no purpose,<br />
					is not connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders, is the fourfold faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring in regard to speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring as to thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one comes to be covetous;<br />
					he covets that which is the property of another, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'O that what is the other's might be mine';</p>

					<p class="f4">he is malevolent in mind,<br />
					corrupt in thought and purpose,<br />
					and thinks,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings be killed or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed,<br />
					or may they not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is of wrong view,<br />
					of perverted outlook,<br />
					thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no (result of) gift,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there is no (result of) offering,<br />
					no (result of) sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds well done or ill done;<br />
					there is not this <a id="pg346"><span class="f2 g"><b>[346]</b></span></a> world,<br />
					there is not a world beyond;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there is not a mother,<br />
					there is not a father,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there are no spontaneously uprising beings;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there are not in the world recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly,<br />
					proceeding rightly,<br />
					and who proclaim this world<br />
					and the world beyond,<br />
					having realised them by their own super-knowledge.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders, is the threefold faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring in regard to thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, householders, that as a result of faring by not-<i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring,<br />
					some beings here,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					arise in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And threefold, householders, is the faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to body,<br />
					fourfold is the faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to speech,<br />
					threefold is the faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to body?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one,<br />
					abandoning onslaught on creatures,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is restrained from onslaught on creatures;<br />
					the stick laid aside,<br />
					the sword laid aside,<br />
					he lives scrupulous,<br />
					merciful,<br />
					kindly and compassionate to all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning taking what is not given,<br />
					he is restrained from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not take by theft<br />
					any property of another<br />
					in village or jungle<br />
					that is not given to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses,<br />
					he is restrained from wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br />
					he does not have intercourse with (girls) who are protected by the mother,<br />
					protected by the father,<br />
					protected by the parents,<br />
					protected by a brother,<br />
					protected by a sister,<br />
					protected by relations,<br />
					who have a husband,<br />
					whose use involves punishment,<br />
					nor even with those adorned with <a id="pg347"><span class="f2 g"><b>[347]</b></span></a> the garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders is the threefold faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the fourfold faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one,<br />
					abandoning lying speech<br />
					is restrained from lying speech.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he is cited and asked as a witness before a council<br />
					or company<br />
					or amid his relations<br />
					or amid a guild<br />
					or amid a royal family,<br />
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, good man, say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">if he does not know, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know';</p>

					<p class="f4">if he knows, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know';</p>

					<p class="f4">if he has not seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not see,'</p>

					<p class="f4">if he has seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I saw.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech does not come to be intentional lying<br />
					either for his own sake<br />
					or for that of another<br />
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech,<br />
					he is restrained from slanderous speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard something at one place,<br />
					he is not one for repeating it elsewhere<br />
					for (causing) variance among those people,<br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he is not one to repeat it to these people<br />
					for (causing) variance among these people.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he is a reconciler of those who are at variance<br />
					and one who combines those who are friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concord is his pleasure,<br />
					concord his delight,<br />
					concord his joy,<br />
					concord is the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning harsh speech,<br />
					he is restrained from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is gentle,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasant to the multitude -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning frivolous chatter,<br />
					he is restrained from frivolous chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who speaks at a right time,<br />
					who speaks in accordance with fact,<br />
					who speaks about the goal,<br />
					who speaks about <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					who speaks about discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is worth treasuring,<br />
					with similes at a right time,<br />
					purposeful,<br />
					connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders, is the fourfold faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one comes to be not covetous,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he does not covet the property of another,<br />

					<p class="f4">'O, might that be mine which is the other's.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is not malevolent in mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman householders of Sālā spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful good Gotama,<br />
					it is wonderful, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">As if one might set upright what has been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or might show the way to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or bring an oil lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so in many a figure has <i>dhamma</i> been proclaimed by the revered Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">We ourselves are going to the reverend Gotama for refuge,<br />
					to <i>dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the revered Gotama accept us as lay-followers<br />
					going for refuge from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>
