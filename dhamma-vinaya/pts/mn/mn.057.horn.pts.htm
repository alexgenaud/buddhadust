					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Koḷiyans; the market town of the Koḷiyans was called Haliddavasana.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then Puṇṇa, a Koḷiyan who was a bovine ascetic,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and Seniya who was an unclothed canine ascetic,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan who was the bovine ascetic,<br />
					after greeting the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic,<br />
					having exchanged greetings with the Lord<br />
					and conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance<br />
					doubling up like a dog.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br />
					the bovine ascetic,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg55"><span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span></a> "Revered sir, this Seniya,<br />
					an unclothed canine ascetic,<br />
					is a doer of things hard to do -<br />
					he eats lying on the ground,<br />
					a canine practice<br />
					which has been carried out in full by him<br />
					for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> what his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, Puṇṇa,<br />
					let this be,<br />
					do not ask me this."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br />
					the bovine ascetic,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, this Seniya,<br />
					an unclothed canine ascetic,<br />
					is a doer of things hard to do -<br />
					he eats lying on the ground,<br />
					a canine practice<br />
					which has been carried out in full by him<br />
					for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[And a second time the Lord responded]:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, Puṇṇa,<br />
					let this be,<br />
					do not ask me this."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br />
					the bovine ascetic,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, this Seniya,<br />
					an unclothed canine ascetic,<br />
					is a doer of things hard to do -<br />
					he eats lying on the ground,<br />
					a canine practice<br />
					which has been carried out in full by him<br />
					for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Although I, Puṇṇa,<br />
					did not really countenance your (question) and said:<br />
					'Enough, Puṇṇa,<br />
					let this be,<br />
					do not ask me this,'<br />
					nevertheless I will explain to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Puṇṇa,<br />
					someone develops the canine practice completely and constantly,<br />
					he develops the canine habits<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> completely and constantly,<br />
					he develops the canine mentality completely and constantly,<br />
					he develops the canine behaviour<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> completely and constantly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having developed the canine practice completely and constantly,<br />
					having developed the canine habits completely and constantly,<br />

					having developed the canine behaviour completely and constantly,<br />
					he, on the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					arises in companionship with dogs.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he should have a view like this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, through this habit<br />
					or practice<br />
					or austerity<br />
					or chastity,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />

					or a (lesser) deva'.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> -</p>

					<p class="f4">that is a wrong view on his part.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, Puṇṇa, say that there is one of two bourns for one of wrong view:<br />
					either Niraya Hell or animal birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is, Puṇṇa,<br />
					that the canine practice,<br />
					on prospering,<br />
					leads to companionship with dogs,<br />
					on failing,<br />
					to Niraya Hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic<br />
					cried out and burst into tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke thus to Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br />
					the bovine ascetic:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I did not countenance this (question) of yours, Puṇṇa,<br />
					(so) I said:<br />
					'Enough, Puṇṇa,<br />

					do not ask me this.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir,<br />
					am not crying because the Lord speaks thus about me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, revered sir,<br />
					because this canine practice has been carried <a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> out in full by me for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, this Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan<br />

					has been carried out in full by him<br />

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, Seniya, let this be, do not ask me this."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, this Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan<br />
					is a bovine ascetic,<br />
					and the bovine practice<br />
					has been carried out in full by him<br />

					<p class="f4">What is his bourn, what his future state?'</p>

					<p class="f4">[And a second time the Lord responded]:</p>

					someone develops the bovine practice completely and constantly,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having developed the bovine practice completely and constantly,<br />

					having developed the bovine mentality completely and constantly,<br />
					having developed the bovine behaviour completely and constantly, he,<br />

					<p class="f4">I, Seniya, say that there is one of two bourns<br />

					<p class="f4">So it is, Seniya,<br />
					that the bovine practice,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, revered sir, am not crying because the Lord speaks thus about me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, revered sir,<br />
					because this bovine practice has been carried out in full by me for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, I have trust<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> in the Lord thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord is able so to teach dhamma<br />
					that I might give up this bovine practice,<br />
					and Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic<br />
					might give up that canine practice."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Puṇṇa, listen,<br />
					pay careful attention,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir," Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br />
					the bovine ascetic,<br />
					answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> "Puṇṇa, these four (kinds of) deeds<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are made known by me,<br />
					having realized them by my own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br />
					the deed that is dark,<br />
					dark in result.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br />
					the deed that is bright,<br />
					bright in result.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br />
					the deed that is dark and bright,<br />
					dark and bright in result.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Puṇṇa,<br />
					the deed that is not dark (and) not bright,<br />
					neither dark nor bright in result,<br />
					the deed that conduces to the destruction of deeds.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is the deed that is dark,<br />
					dark in result?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Puṇṇa,<br />
					someone effects<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> an activity of body<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> that is harmful,<br />
					he effects an activity of speech that is harmful,<br />
					he effects an activity of mind that is harmful.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having effected an activity of body that is harmful,<br />
					having effected an activity of speech that is harmful,<br />
					having effected an activity of mind that is harmful,<br />
					arises in a world that is harmful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he has uprisen in a world that is harmful,<br />
					harmful sensory impingements assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being assailed by harmful sensory impingements,<br />
					experiences a harmful feeling,<br />
					without exception painful,<br />
					even as do creatures in Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span>Puṇṇa,<br />
					there is the uprising of a being<br />
					from what has come to be<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span>;<br />
					he uprises according to what he does<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>;<br />
					when he has uprisen<br />
					sensory impingements assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I speak thus, Puṇṇa,:<br />
					Creatures are heirs to deeds.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, Puṇṇa, is called<br />
					the deed that is dark,<br />
					dark in result.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is the deed that is bright,<br />
					bright in result?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Puṇṇa,<br />
					someone effects an activity of body that is harmless,<br />
					effects an activity of speech that is harmless,<br />
					effects an activity of mind that is harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having effected an activity of body that is harmless,<br />
					having effected an activity of speech that is harmless,<br />
					having effected an activity of mind that is harmless,<br />
					arises in a world that is harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he has uprisen in a world that is harmless,<br />
					harmless sensory impingements assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being assailed by harmless sensory impingements,<br />
					experiences a harmless feeling,<br />
					without exception pleasant,<br />
					even as do the Ever-Radiant <i>devas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Puṇṇa,<br />
					there is the uprising of a being from what has come <a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> to be;<br />
					he uprises according to what he does;<br />
					when he has uprisen<br />
					sensory impingements assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I speak thus, Puṇṇa,:</p>

					<p class="f4">Creatures are heirs to deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is called the deed that is bright,<br />
					bright in result.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is the deed that is dark and bright,<br />
					dark and bright in result?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Puṇṇa,<br />
					someone effects an activity of body that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					effects an activity of speech that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					effects an activity of mind that is harmful and harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having effected an activity of body that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					having effected an activity of speech that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					having effected an activity of mind that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					arises in a world that is harmful and harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he has uprisen in a world that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					harmful and harmless sensory impingements assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being assailed by harmful and harmless sensory impingements,<br />
					experiences a feeling that is harmful and harmless,<br />
					partially pleasant and painful,<br />
					even as do men and some <i>devas</i><br />
					and some in the sorrowful state.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Puṇṇa,<br />
					there is the uprising of a being from what has come to be;<br />
					he uprises according to what he does;<br />
					when he has uprisen<br />
					sensory impingements assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I speak thus, Puṇṇa,:</p>

					<p class="f4">Creatures are heirs to deeds.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is called the deed that is dark and bright,<br />
					dark and bright in result.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is the deed that is not dark (and) not bright,<br />
					neither dark nor bright in result,<br />
					the deed that conduces to the destruction of deeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, Puṇṇa,<br />
					there is the will<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> to get rid of that deed<br />
					that is dark,<br />
					dark in result,<br />
					and the will to get rid of that deed<br />
					that is bright,<br />
					bright in result,<br />
					and the will to get rid of that deed<br />
					that is dark and bright,<br />
					dark and bright in result,<br />
					this, Puṇṇa,<br />
					is called the deed that is not dark (and) not bright,<br />
					neither dark nor bright in result,<br />
					the deed that conduces to the destruction of deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Puṇṇa,<br />
					are the four (kinds of) deeds made known by me,<br />
					having realized them by my own super-knowledge."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					Puṇṇa, the Koḷiyan,<br />
					the bovine ascetic, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, revered sir,<br />
					it is excellent, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, revered sir one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or show the way to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes —<br />
					even so in many a figure has <i>Dhamma</i> been made clear by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, revered sir, am going to the Lord for refuge<br />
					and the <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Lord accept me as a lay-disciple<br />
					going for refuge from this day forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

					<p class="f4">But Seniya the unclothed canine ascetic<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, revered sir,<br />
					it is excellent, revered sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, revered sir, one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might <a id="pg59"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span></a> disclose what was covered,<br />

					or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so in many a figure has <i>Dhamma</i> been made clear by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I, revered sir, am going to the Lord for refuge<br />
					and to dhamma<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, may I receive the going forth in the Lord's presence,<br />
					may I receive ordination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seniya, if a former member of another sect<br />
					wishes for the going forth in this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline,<br />
					wishes for ordination,<br />
					he undertakes probation for four months<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>;<br />
					at the end of the four months<br />
					the monks, if they so decide,<br />

					may ordain him into the status of a monk;<br />
					but even here differences among individuals are known to me."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"If, revered sir, former members of other sects,<br />

					at the end of the four years<br />

					<p class="f4">But Seniya, the unclothed canine ascetic,<br />
					received the going forth in the Lord's presence,<br />
					he received ordination.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after he was ordained<br />
					the venerable Seniya,<br />

					aloof,<br />
					diligent,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					self-resolute,<br />
					in no long time<br />
					having realized here-now<br />
					by his own super-knowledge<br />
					that matchless culmination of the Brahma-faring<br />
					for the sake of which young men of family<br />
					rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					entering on it,<br />
					abided in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br />
