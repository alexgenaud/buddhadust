					<p class="f4">At one time, the Lord,<br />
					walking on tour among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans</a><br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman householders of Nagaravinda heard it said that</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, the recluse Gotama,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					and walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					has arrived at the brahman village of the Kosalans called Nagaravinda.</p>

					<p class="f4">A lovely reputation concerning the recluse Gotama has gone abroad thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realised through his own super-knowledge,<br />
					he makes known this world<br />
					together with devas<br />
					including the Māras and the Brahmās;<br />
					creatures<br />
					together with recluses and brahmans,<br />
					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>dhamma</i><br />
					that is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle<br />
					and lovely at the ending;<br />
					he explains with the spirit and the letter<br />
					the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled<br />
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br />
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman householders of Nagaravinda<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached him,<br />
					some exchanged greetings with the Lord<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having informed <a id="pg340"><span class="f2 g"><b>[340]</b></span></a> the Lord of their names and clans,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, becoming silent,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the brahman householders of Nagaravinda<br />
					as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, householders,<br />
					wanderers belonging to other sects<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>ke pan'āyasmantānaṁ ākārā,</i> lit.: What are the venerable ones' grounds? Here too, in the same sentence, the wanderers appear to address the householders as <i>āyasmanto,</i> although this form is both nom. and voc. pl. The householders, on the other hand, appear to address the wanderers both as <i>āvuso,</i> "your reverences" (a few lines lower down) and as <i>āyasmanto.</i> The question: What grounds do the venerable ones have ... by which you, venerable ones, should speak thus; <i>yena tumhe āyasmanto evaṁ vadetha,</i> is balanced by the answer: These, your reverences, are the grounds ... by which we, venerable ones, speak thus, <i>yena mayaṁ āyasmanto evaṁ vadema.</i></p>
