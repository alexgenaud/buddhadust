					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time brahman householders of Verañjā<br />
					entered Sāvatthī on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman householders of Verañjā heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is said that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan family,<br />
					and walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					has reached Verañjā,<br />
					and that a lovely reputation has gone forth <a id="pg350"><span class="f2 g"><b>[350]</b></span></a> about the Lord Gotama thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with knowledge and (right) conduct,<br />
					Well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realized through his own super-knowledge,<br />
					he makes known this world<br />
					together with devas<br />
					including the Māras and the Brahmās;<br />
					creatures<br />
					together with recluses and brahmans,<br />
					with devas and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that is lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle<br />
					and lovely at the ending;<br />
					he explains with the spirit and the letter<br />
					the Brahma-faring<br />
					completely fulfilled<br />
					and wholly purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed is the sight<br />
					of perfected ones such as this."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman householders of Verañjā approached the Lord;<br />
					some, having approached, having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, becoming silent,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the brahman householders of Verañjā spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what is the cause, good Gotama,<br />
					what is the reason why some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause,<br />
					what is the reason, good Gotama,<br />
					why some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householders, some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise thus in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell<br />
					because of faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					an uneven faring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, some beings here at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise thus in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven-world,<br />
					because of faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					an even faring."</p>

					<p class="f4">"We do not understand in full<br />
					the matter that has been spoken of in brief by the good Gotama,<br />
					and whose meaning was not explained in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good if the good Gotama were so to teach us <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that we might understand in full<br />
					the matter spoken of in brief by the good Gotama,<br />
					and whose meaning was not explained in full."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, householders, listen,<br />
					pay careful attention,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," these brahman householders of Verañjā answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Threefold, householders,<br />
					is the faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					an uneven faring as to body;<br />
					fourfold is the faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					an uneven faring as to speech;<br />
					threefold is the faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					and uneven faring as to thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by not <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring as to body?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders,<br />
					a certain one makes onslaught on creatures,<br />
					he is cruel,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					intent on injuring and killing,<br />
					without mercy to living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a taker of what is not given;<br />
					whatever property of another<br />
					in village or jungle<br />
					is not given to him<br />
					he takes by theft.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a wrong-goer in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br />
					he has intercourse with (girls) protected by the mother,<br />
					protected by the father,<br />
					protected by the parents,<br />
					protected by a brother,<br />
					protected by a sister,<br />
					protected by relations,<br />
					who have a husband,<br />
					whose use involves punishments,<br />
					and even with those adorned with garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders,<br />
					is the threefold faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring, in regard to the body.</p>

					<p>And how, householders, does there come to be the fourfold faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring as to speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders,<br />
					a certain one is of lying speech;<br />
					when he is cited and asked as a witness<br />
					before a council<br />
					or company<br />
					or amid his relations<br />
					or amid a guild<br />
					or amid a royal family,<br />
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, good man, say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he does not know, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he knows, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know';</p>

					<p class="f4">although he has not seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I saw,'</p>

					<p class="f4">although he has seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech becomes intentional lying<br />
					either for his own sake<br />
					or for the sake of another<br />
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a slanderer;<br />
					having heard something at one place,<br />
					he makes it known elsewhere<br />
					for (causing) variance among those (people);<br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he makes it known among these people<br />
					for (causing) variance among these (people).</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he sows discord among those who are in harmony,<br />
					or is one who foments those who are at variance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Discord is his pleasure,<br />
					discord his delight,<br />
					discord his joy,<br />
					discord is the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is one of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is rough,<br />
					hard,<br />
					severe on others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					bordering on wrath,<br />
					not conducive to concentration,<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is a frivolous chatterer,<br />
					one who speaks at a wrong time,<br />
					one who does not speak in accordance with fact,<br />
					one who speaks about what is not the goal,<br />
					one who speaks about not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					one who speaks about not-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is not worth treasuring;<br />
					owing to its being at the wrong time<br />
					it is incongruous,<br />
					has no purpose,<br />
					is not connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders, is the fourfold faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring in regard to speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring as to thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one comes to be covetous;<br />
					he covets that which is the property of another, thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'O that what is the other's might be mine';</p>

					<p class="f4">he is malevolent in mind,<br />
					corrupt in thought and purpose,<br />
					and thinks,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings be killed or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed,<br />
					or may they not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is of wrong view,<br />
					of perverted outlook,<br />
					thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no (result of) gift,<br />
					there is no (result of) offering,<br />
					no (result of) sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds well done or ill done;<br />
					there is not this world,<br />
					there is not a world beyond;<br />
					there is not a mother,<br />
					there is not a father,<br />
					there are no spontaneously uprising beings;<br />
					there are not in the world recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly,<br />
					proceeding rightly,<br />
					and who proclaim this world<br />
					and the world beyond,<br />
					having realized them by their own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders, is the threefold faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring in regard to thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, householders, that as a result of faring by not-<i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the uneven faring,<br />
					some beings here,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					arise in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And threefold, householders, is the faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to body,<br />
					fourfold is the faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to speech,<br />
					threefold is the faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to body?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one,<br />
					abandoning onslaught on creatures,<br />
					is restrained from onslaught on creatures;<br />
					the stick laid aside,<br />
					the sword laid aside,<br />
					he lives scrupulous,<br />
					merciful,<br />
					kindly and compassionate to all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning taking what is not given,<br />
					he is restrained from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not take by theft<br />
					any property of another<br />
					in village or jungle<br />
					that is not given to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses,<br />
					he is restrained from wrong-doing in regard to pleasures of the senses;<br />
					he does not have intercourse with (girls) who are protected by the mother,<br />
					protected by the father,<br />
					protected by the parents,<br />
					protected by a brother,<br />
					protected by a sister,<br />
					protected by relations,<br />
					who have a husband,<br />
					whose use involves punishment,<br />
					nor even with those adorned with the garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders is the threefold faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the fourfold faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one,<br />
					abandoning lying speech<br />
					is restrained from lying speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is cited and asked as a witness before a council<br />
					or company<br />
					or amid his relations<br />
					or amid a guild<br />
					or amid a royal family,<br />
					and is told:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, good man, say what you know,'</p>

					<p class="f4">if he does not know, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know';</p>

					<p class="f4">if he knows, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know';</p>

					<p class="f4">if he has not seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I did not see,'</p>

					<p class="f4">if he has seen, he says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I saw.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus his speech does not come to be intentional lying<br />
					either for his own sake<br />
					or for that of another<br />
					or for the sake of some material gain or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech,<br />
					he is restrained from slanderous speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard something at one place,<br />
					he is not one for repeating it elsewhere<br />
					for (causing) variance among those people,<br />
					or having heard something elsewhere<br />
					he is not one to repeat it to these people<br />
					for (causing) variance among these people.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he is a reconciler of those who are at variance<br />
					and one who combines those who are friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concord is his pleasure,<br />
					concord his delight,<br />
					concord his joy,<br />
					concord is the motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning harsh speech,<br />
					he is restrained from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is gentle,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasant to the multitude -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning frivolous chatter,<br />
					he is restrained from frivolous chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who speaks at a right time,<br />
					who speaks in accordance with fact,<br />
					who speaks about the goal,<br />
					who speaks about <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					who speaks about discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters speech that is worth treasuring,<br />
					with similes at a right time,<br />
					purposeful,<br />
					connected with the goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, householders, is the fourfold faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders, is the threefold faring by <i>Dhamma</i>,<br />
					the even faring in regard to thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, householders, a certain one comes to be not covetous,<br />
					he does not covet the property of another,<br />
					thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'O, might that be mine which is the other's.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is not malevolent in mind,<br />
					not corrupt of thought and purpose,<br />
					but thinks,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings, friendly, peaceful, secure, happy, look after self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is of right view,<br />
					not of perverted outlook,<br />
					thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is (result of) gift,<br />
