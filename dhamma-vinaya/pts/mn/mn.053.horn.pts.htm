					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was staying among the Sakyans<br />
					near Kapilavatthu<br />
					in Nigrodha's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a new conference hall had not long been built<br />
					for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					and had never (yet) been occupied<br />
					by a recluse or brahman or any human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there is a new conference hall here,<br />
					built not long ago<br />
					for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					which has never (yet) been occupied<br />
					by a recluse or brahman or any human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, let the Lord be the first to use it.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord has used it first,<br />
					the Sakyans <a id="pg19"><span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></a> of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwards,<br />
					and for a long time<br />
					that will be for the welfare and happiness<br />
					of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					having understood the Lord's consent,<br />
					rising from their seats,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					approached the conference hall<br />
					keeping their right sides towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having approached,<br />
					having spread the conference hall<br />
					with all the spreadings,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having got seats ready,<br />
					having set out a water vessel,<br />
					having hung up an oil lamp,<br />
					they approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					they stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were standing at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu spoke thus<br />
					to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the conference hall has been spread<br />
					with all the spreadings,<br />
					seats have been got ready,<br />
					a water vessel set out,<br />
					an oil lamp hung up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Lord now do<br />
					that for which he thinks it is the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord had dressed,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					he approached the conference hall<br />
					together with an Order of monks;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he washed his feet,<br />
					entered the conference hall<br />
					and sat down against the middle pillar,<br />
					facing the east.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Order of monks<br />
					also washed their feet,<br />
					entered the conference hall<br />
					and sat down against the western wall,<br />
					facing the east<br />
					with the Lord in front of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					also washed their feet,<br />
					entered the conference hall<br />
					and sat down against the eastern wall,<br />
					facing the west<br />
					with the Lord in front of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu<br />
					with reasoned talk<br />
					far into the night,<br />
					addressed the venerable Ānanda,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, let there occur to you<br />
					a learner's course<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu;<br />
					my back is aching,<br />
					I will stretch it."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg20"><span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></a> "Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					the venerable Ānanda answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />
					having folded his outer robe into four,<br />
					lay down on his right side<br />
					in the lion posture,<br />
					foot resting on foot,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					clearly conscious,<br />
					reflecting on the thought of getting up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda<br />
					addressed Mahānāma the Sakyan,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Mahānāma,<br />
					a disciple of the ariyans<br />
					is possessed of moral habit,<br />
					he is one who guards the doors of the sense-organs,<br />
					he is moderate in eating,<br />
					intent on vigilance,<br />
					possessed of the seven excellent things,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					one who acquires at will,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					without trouble,<br />
					without difficulty,<br />
					the four meditations<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					which are of the purest mentality,<br />
					abidings in ease here and now.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Mahānāma,<br />
					is an ariyan disciple<br />
					possessed of moral habit?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Mahānāma,<br />
					an ariyan disciple is moral;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he lives controlled<br />
					by the control of the Obligations,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn3" href="#edn3">ed3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					possessed of (right) behaviour and resort,<br />
					seeing danger in the slightest faults;<br />
					undertaking them rightly,<br />
					he trains in the rules of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Mahānāma,<br />
					that an ariyan disciple<br />
					is possessed of moral habit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Mahānāma,<br />
					is an ariyan disciple<br />
					one who guards the doors of the sense-organs?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Mahānāma,<br />
					an ariyan disciple,<br />
					having seen a material shape with the eye,<br />
					is not entranced by the general appearance,<br />
					is not entranced by the detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if he dwell<br />
					with the organ of sight uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil unskilled states of mind,<br />
					might predominate.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he fares along controlling it,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard a sound with the ear,<br />

					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil unskilled states of mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">So he fares along controlling it,<br />

					he achieves control over the organ of hearing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having smelt a smell with the nose,<br />
					is not entranced by the general appearance,<br />

					<p class="f4">For if he dwell<br />
					with the organ of smell uncontrolled,<br />

					<p class="f4">So he fares along controlling it,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having savoured a taste with the tongue,<br />
					is not entranced by the general appearance,<br />
					is not entranced by the detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if he dwell<br />
					with the organ of taste uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil unskilled states of mind,<br />
					might predominate.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he fares along controlling it,<br />
					he guards the organ of taste;<br />
					he achieves control over the organ of taste.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having felt a touch with the body,<br />
					is not entranced by the general appearance,<br />
					is not entranced by the detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">For if he dwell<br />
					with the organ of touch uncontrolled,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					evil unskilled states of mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">So he fares along controlling it,<br />
					he guards the organ of touch;<br />
					he achieves control over the organ of touch.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cognised a mental state with the mind,<br />
					he is not entranced by the general<br />
					<a id="pg21"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span></a> appearance,<br />
					is not entranced by the detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he dwell with the organ of mind uncontrolled,<br />

					<p class="f4">So he fares along controlling it,<br />

					he achieves control over the organ of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Mahānāma,<br />
					that an ariyan disciple<br />
					is one who guards the doors of the sense-organs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how Mahānāma,<br />
					is an ariyan disciple<br />
					one who is moderate in eating?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Mahānāma,<br />
					an ariyan disciple<br />
					takes food reflecting carefully,<br />
					not for fun<br />
					or indulgence<br />
					or personal charm<br />
					or beautification,<br />
					but just enough for maintaining this body<br />
					and keeping it going,<br />
					for keeping it unharmed,<br />
					for furthering the Brahma-faring,<br />
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus will I crush out an old feeling,<br />
					and I will not allow a new feeling to arise,<br />
					and then there will be for me<br />
					subsistence and blamelessness<br />
					and abiding in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Mahānāma,<br />
					that an ariyan disciple<br />
					is moderate in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how Mahānāma,<br />
					is an ariyan disciple<br />
					intent on vigilance?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Mahānāma,<br />
					an ariyan disciple<br />
					during the day,<br />
					while pacing up and down<br />
					and while sitting down,<br />
					cleanses his mind<br />
					of obstructive mental states;<br />
					during the first watch of the night,<br />
					pacing up and down,<br />
					sitting down,<br />
					he cleanses his mind<br />
					of obstructive mental states;<br />
					during the middle watch of the night,<br />
					he lies down on his right side<br />
					in the lion posture,<br />
					foot resting on foot,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					clearly conscious,<br />
					reflecting on the thought<br />
					of getting up again;<br />
					during the last watch of the night,<br />
					when he has risen,<br />
					while pacing up and down,<br />
					while sitting down,<br />
					he cleanses his mind<br />
					of obstructive mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Mahānāma,<br />
					that an ariyan disciple<br />
					is intent on vigilance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Mahānāma,<br />
					is an ariyan disciple<br />
					possessed of the seven excellent things?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Mahānāma,<br />
					the ariyan disciple is of faith;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he has faith in the awakening of the Tathāgata,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is indeed Lord,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					endowed with right knowledge and conduct,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					knower of the world(s),<br />
					matchless charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of <i>devas</i> and men,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to have shame;<br />
					he is ashamed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					of wrong conduct in speech,<br />
					of wrong conduct in thought,<br />
					he is ashamed to fall<br />
					into evil unskilled mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has fear of blame;<br />
					he fears blame for wrong conduct in body,<br />
					of wrong conduct in speech,<br />
					of wrong conduct in thought,<br />
					he is ashamed to fall<br />
					into evil unskilled mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> He is one who has heard much,<br />
					who remembers what he has heard,<br />
					who stores up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those things,<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the ending<br />
					which,<br />
					with the meaning and the spirit,<br />
					declare the Brahma-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					perfectly purified,<br />
					such things are much heard by him,<br />
					borne in mind,<br />
					familiarised by speech,<br />
					pondered over in the mind,<br />
					well penetrated by right view.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with stirred up energy<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for getting rid of unskilled mental states,<br />
					for acquiring skilled mental states,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					firm in advance,<br />
					persevering amid skilled mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is mindful,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					possessed of the highest<br />
					mindfulness and discrimination,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span><br />
					remembering,<br />
					recollecting<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					what he has done and said long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one of wisdom,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
					endowed with wisdom<br />
					leading to (the cutting off of)<br />
					rise and fall,<br />
					with the ariyan penetration<br />
					leading to the complete destruction of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Mahānāma,<br />
					that an ariyan disciple<br />
					is possessed of the seven excellent things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Mahānāma,<br />
					is an ariyan disciple<br />
					one who acquires at will,<br />
					without trouble,<br />
					without difficulty,<br />
					the four meditations<br />
					which are of the purest mentality,<br />
					abidings in ease here and now?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Mahānāma,<br />
					an ariyan disciple,<br />
					aloof from pleasure of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters and abides in the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allaying initial and discursive thought,<br />
					with the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					he enters and abides<br />
					in the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and he enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Mahānāma,<br />
					that an ariyan disciple<br />
					is one who acquires at will,<br />
					without trouble,<br />
					without difficulty,<br />
					the four meditations<br />
					which are of the purest mentality,<br />
					abidings in ease here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Mahānāma, an ariyan disciple<br />

					is moderate in eating thus,<br />
					is intent on vigilance thus,<br />
					is endowed with the seven excellent things thus,<br />

					the four meditations<br />
					which are of the <a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> purest mentality,<br />

					then he, Mahānāma,<br />
					is called an ariyan disciple<br />
					who is on a learner's course,<br />
					possessed of (mental) soundness,<br />
					he becomes one for successful breaking through,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he becomes one for self-awakening,<br />
					he becomes one for winning<br />
					the matchless security from the bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mahānāma,<br />
					it is as if there were eight<br />
					or ten<br />
					or a dozen hen's eggs,<br />
					properly sat on,<br />
					properly incubated,<br />
					properly hatched by that hen;<br />
					such a wish as this<br />
					would not arise in that hen:</p>

					<p class="f4">'O may my chicks,<br />
					having pierced through the egg-shell<br />
					with the point of the claw on their feet<br />

					<p class="f4">for these chicks were ones<br />
					who were able to break forth safely<br />
					having pierced the egg-shells<br />
					with the point of the claw on their feet<br />
					or with their beaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Mahānāma,<br />
					when an ariyan disciple<br />

					is one who guards the doors of his sense-organs thus,<br />
					is moderate in eating thus,<br />
					is intent on vigilance thus,<br />

					<p class="f4">That ariyan disciple, Mahānāma,<br />
					having come to this matchless purification<br />
					through equanimity<br />
					and mindfulness,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span><br />
					recollects a variety of former habitations,<br />
					that is to say:<br />
					one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />

					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Such a one was I by name,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is his first breaking through<br />
