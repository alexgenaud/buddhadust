					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord,<br />
					walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a large Order of monks,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					arrived at the Brahman village of the Kosalans named Sālā.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brahman householders of Sālā heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is said that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the son of the Sakyans,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan family,<br />
					and walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					<a id="pt401" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg401"><span class="f2">[401]</span></a> together with a large Order of monks,<br />
					has reached Sālā,<br />
					and that a lovely reputation has gone forth<br />
					about the Lord Gotama thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord is perfected,<br />
					wholly Self-awakened,<br />
					endowed with (right) knowledge and conduct,<br />
					well-farer,<br />
					knower of the worlds,<br />
					incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and men,<br />
					the Awakened One,<br />
					the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world<br />
					with the <i>devas,</i><br />
					with Māra,<br />
					with Brahmā,<br />
					creation<br />
					with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its <i>devas</i> and men,<br />
					having realized them<br />
					by his own super-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					that is lovely at the <a id="pg70"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></a> beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the ending,<br />
					with the spirit and the letter;<br />
					he proclaims the Brahmā-faring<br />
					wholly fulfilled,<br />
					quite purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good to see perfected ones like this.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brahman householders of Sālā<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					some, having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some exchanged greetings with the Lord<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance;<br />
					some, becoming silent,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the Brahman householders of Sālā:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you, householders,<br />
					some satisfactory teacher<br />
					in whom your faith is grounded?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We have no satisfactory teacher, revered sir,<br />
					in whom our faith is grounded."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If you, householders,<br />
					have no satisfactory teacher,<br />
					then taking up this sure<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					you should practise it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, householders, sure is <i>Dhamma</i>;<br />
					rightly undertaken,<br />
					it will long be for your welfare and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, householders,<br />
					is this sure <i>dhamma?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There are, householders,<br />
					some recluses and Brahmans<br />
					who speak thus<br />
					and are of these views:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no (result of) gift,<br />
					there is no (result of) offering,<br />
					no (result of) sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done;<br />
					there is not this world,<br />
					there is not a world beyond;<br />
					there is no (benefit from serving) mother or father;<br />
					there are no spontaneously arising beings;<br />
					there are not in the world<br />
					recluses and Brahmans<br />
					who are faring rightly,<br />
					proceeding rightly,<br />
					and who proclaim this world<br />
					and a world beyond,<br />
					having realized them<br />
					by their own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, householders,<br />
					there are <a id="pt402" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg402"><span class="f2">[402]</span></a> some recluses and Brahmans<br />
					who speak in direct opposition<br />
					to these recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					and who say this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is (result of) gift,<br />
					there is (result of) offering,<br />
					there is (result of) sacrifice;<br />
					there is fruit and ripening<br />
					of deeds well done and ill done;<br />
					there is this world,<br />
					there is a world beyond;<br />
					there is (benefit from serving) mother and father;<br />
					there are spontaneously uprising beings;<br />
					there are in the world<br />
					recluses and Brahmans<br />
					who are faring rightly,<br />
					proceeding rightly,<br />
					and who proclaim this world<br />
					and a world beyond,<br />
					<a id="pg71"><span class="f2 g"><b>[71]</b></span></a> having realized them by their own super-knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, householders?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not these recluses and Brahmans<br />
					speak in direct opposition to one another?"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As to this, householders,<br />
					of those recluses and Brahmans<br />
					who speak thus<br />
					and are of these views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no (result of) gift,<br />
					there is no (result of) offering,<br />

					there is not a world beyond;<br />
					there is no (benefit from serving) mother or father;<br />
					there are no spontaneously arising beings;<br />
					there are not in the world<br />
					recluses and Brahmans<br />
					who are faring rightly,<br />
					proceeding rightly,<br />
					and who proclaim this world<br />
					and a world beyond,<br />
					having realized them<br />
					by their own super-knowledge,'</p>

					<p class="f4">this is to be expected for them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Having laid aside<br />
					these three good things:<br />
					right conduct of body,<br />
					right conduct of speech,<br />
					right conduct of thought,<br />
					and taking up these three bad things:<br />
					wrong conduct of body,<br />
					wrong conduct of speech,<br />
					wrong conduct of thought,<br />
					they practise them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that these worthy recluses and Brahmans<br />
					do not see the peril in wrong things,<br />
					the vanity,<br />
					the defilement,<br />
					nor the advantage,<br />
					allied to purity,<br />
					of renouncing them<br />
					for the good things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And because there is indeed a world beyond,<br />
					the view of anyone<br />
					that there is not a world beyond<br />
					is a false view of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond,<br />

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond,<br />

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond,<br />
					if anyone says that<br />
					there is not a world beyond,<br />
					he makes mock of those perfected ones<br />
					who are knowers of a world beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">As there is indeed a world beyond,<br />
					if he convinces others<br />
					that there is not a world beyond,<br />
					that convincing of his<br />
					is against true <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					and because of that convincing<br />
					which is against true <i>Dhamma,</i><br />
					he is exalting himself<br />
					and disparaging others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, before his good morality<br />
					is got rid of,<br />
					bad morality is set up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this false view,<br />
					false conception,<br />
					false speech,<br />
					the mocking of the ariyans,<br />

					<p class="f4">But if it be granted<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus this sure <i>Dhamma</i><br />

					<p class="f4">Possessed of this ariyan body of moral habit,<br />
					possessed of this ariyan control over the sense-organs,<br />
					and possessed of this ariyan mindfulness<br />
					and clear consciousness,<br />
					he chooses a remote lodging<br />

					in a wilderness,<br />
					a hill-cave,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />
					a forest haunt,<br />
					in the open air<br />

					<p class="f4">Returning from alms-gathering<br />
					after the meal,<br />
					he sits down cross-legged<br />
					holding the back erect,<br />
					having made mindfulness rise up in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having got rid of covetousness for the world,<br />
					he lives with a mind devoid of coveting<br />
					and purifies the mind of coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of the taint of ill-will,<br />
					he lives benevolent in mind;<br />
					and compassionate for the welfare<br />
					of all creatures and beings,<br />
					he purifies the mind<br />
					of the taint of ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of sloth and torpor,<br />
					he lives devoid of sloth and torpor;<br />
					perceiving the light,<br />
					mindful and clearly conscious,<br />
					he purifies the mind<br />
					of sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of restlessness and worry,<br />
					he lives calmly,<br />
					the mind inwardly tranquillised,<br />
					and he purifies the mind<br />
					of restlessness and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of doubt,<br />
					he lives doubt-crossed;<br />
					unperplexed as to states that are skilled,<br />
					he purifies the mind of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by getting rid of these five hindrances -<br />
					defilements of the mind<br />
					and weakening to intuitive wisdom -<br />
					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					enters and abides in the first meditation,<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By allying initial and discursive thought,<br />
					the mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second meditation,<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the fading out of rapture,<br />
					he dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful',<br />
					and he enters and abides in the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">By getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth meditation,<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
					and which is entirely purified<br />
					by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the mind composed,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					stable,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection<br />
					of former habitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four births,<br />
					five births,<br />
					ten births,<br />
					twenty births,<br />
					thirty births,<br />
					forty births,<br />
					fifty births,<br />
					a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand births,<br />
					a hundred thousand births,<br />
					and many an eon of integration<br />
					and many an eon of disintegration<br />
					and many an eon of integration-disintegration:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such a one was I by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so I was nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I came to be in another state<br />
					where I was such a one by name,<br />
					having such and such a clan,<br />
					such and such a colour,<br />
					so I was nourished,<br />
					such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine,<br />
					so did the span of life end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing from this,<br />
					I arose here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he recollects<br />
					divers former habitations<br />
					in all their modes and detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the mind composed thus,<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					stable,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the passing hence<br />
					and the arising of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the purified <i>deva</i>-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men,<br />
					he sees beings as they pass hence<br />
					or come to be;<br />
					he comprehends that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going,<br />
					according to the consequences of deeds,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of wrong conduct in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					scoffers at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a wrong view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view -<br />
					these, at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these worthy beings<br />
					who were possessed of good conduct in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					who did not scoff at the ariyans,<br />
					holding a right view,<br />
					incurring deeds consequent on a right view -<br />
					these at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />
					have arisen in a good bourn,<br />
					a heaven world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the purified <i>deva</i>-vision<br />
					surpassing that of men<br />
					does he see beings as they pass hence,<br />
					as they arise;<br />
					he comprehends that beings are mean,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					comely,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					well-going,<br />
					ill-going<br />
					according to the consequences of deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the mind composed thus<br />
					quite purified,<br />
					quite clarified,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					without defilement,<br />
					grown soft and workable,<br />
					stable,<br />
					immovable,<br />
					he directs his mind to<br />
					the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is anguish,<br />
					this is the arising of anguish,<br />
					this is the stopping of anguish,<br />
					this is the course<br />
					leading to the stopping of anguish.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the cankers,<br />
					this is the arising of the cankers,<br />
					this is the stopping of the cankers,<br />
					this is the course<br />
					leading to the stopping of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing thus,<br />
					seeing thus,<br />
					his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures<br />
					and his mind is freed from the canker of becoming<br />
					and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In freedom the knowledge comes to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am freed';<br />
					and he comprehends:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is birth,<br />
					brought to a close the Brahma-faring,<br />
					done is what was to be done,<br />
					there is no more of being such or so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, householders, is called<br />
					the person who is neither a self-torment<br />
					or intent on the practice of tormenting self,<br />
					nor a tormentor of others<br />
					intent on the practice of tormenting others,<br />
					and who,<br />
					neither a self-tormentor<br />
					nor a tormentor of others,<br />
					is here-now allayed,<br />
					quenched,<br />
					become cool,<br />
					an experiencer of bliss<br />
					that lives with self Brahmā-become."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg83"><span class="f2 g"><b>[83]</b></span></a> When this had been said, the Brahman householders of Sālā spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, good Gotama;<br />
					good Gotama, it is excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so in many a figure has <i>Dhamma</i> been made clear by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">We are going to the revered Gotama for refuge<br />
					and to <i>Dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the good Gotama accept us as lay-disciples<br />
