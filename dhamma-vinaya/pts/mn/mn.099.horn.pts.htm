					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					in a householder's dwelling<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I have heard, householder,<br />

					<p class="f4">Could we today<br />

					below,<br />
					across;<br />
					he dwelt having suffused the whole world<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					in every way,<br />
					with a mind of equanimity<br />
					that was far-reaching,<br />
					wide-spread,<br />
					immeasurable,<br />
					without enmity,<br />
					without malevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, brahman youth,<br />
					the freedom of mind that is equanimity<br />
					has been developed thus,<br />
					that deed which is done in a limited range<br />
					does not rest there,<br />
					does not remain there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahman youth,<br />
					as a stout conch-blower informs the four quarters<br />
					without any difficulty,<br />
					so, brahman youth,<br />
					when the freedom of mind that is equanimity<br />
					has been developed thus,<br />
					that deed which is done in a limited range<br />
					does not rest there,<br />
					does not remain there.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman youth,<br />
					is a way to companionship with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama,<br />
					excellent, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br />
					and to <i>dhamma</i><br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the revered Gotama accept me<br />
					as a lay-follower,<br />
					one gone for refuge from today forth<br />
					for as long as life lasts."</p>

					<p class="f4">But, please, good Gotama,<br />
					we are going now,<br />
					we are very busy<br />
					and there is much to be done."</p>

					<p class="f4">"You must do now, brahman youth,<br />
					that for which you deem it to be the right time."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord had said,<br />
					having given thanks,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the brahman Jāṇussoṇi<br />
					was leaving Sāvatthī early in the day<br />
					in a chariot (drawn by) all-white mules.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Jāṇussoṇi saw the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />
					coming in the distance;<br />
					and seeing him,<br />
					he spoke thus to the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, where is the good Bhāradvāja<br />
					coming from so early in the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, sir, am coming from the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think about this,<br />
					good Bhāradvāja?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the recluse Gotama lucidity of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think him clever?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"But who am I, sir,<br />
					that I should know<br />
					whether the recluse Gotama has lucidity of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely only one like him could know<br />
					whether the recluse Gotama has lucidity of wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Undoubtedly it is with lofty praise<br />
					that the revered Bhāradvāja praises the recluse Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who am I<br />
					that I should praise the recluse Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">Praised by the praised<br />
					is the revered Gotama,<br />
					chief among <i>devas</i> and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, sir,<br />
					the recluse Gotama speaks of those five things<br />
					that brahmans lay down<br />
					for the doing of good,<br />
					for success in what is skilled,<br />
					as equipments of the mind,<br />
					that is for developing a mind<br />
					that is without enmity, without malevolence."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman Jāṇussoṇi,<br />
					having got down from his chariot<br />
					(drawn by) all-white mules,<br />
					having arranged his upper cloth over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					uttered this solemn utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					it is well gotten by King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					<a id="pg398"><span class="f2 g"><b>[398]</b></span></a> that the Tathāgata,<br />
