					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then several<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> monks, having dressed in the morning, taking their bowls and <a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> robes, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to these monks;</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is too early to walk for almsfood in Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we were to approach the park<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of the wanderers belonging to other sects?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the park of the wanderers belonging to other sects;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they exchanged greetings with the wanderers belonging to other sects,<br />
					and having exchanged greetings of courtesy and friendliness,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As these monks were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these wanderers belonging to other sects spoke thus to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, the recluse Gotama lays down the full understanding<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> of sense-pleasures;<br />

					<p class="f4">Your reverences, the recluse Gotama lays down the full understanding of material shapes;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					we too lay down the full understanding of material shapes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your reverences, the recluse Gotama lays down the full understanding of feelings;<br />
					we too lay down the full understanding of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, your reverences, herein what is the divergence,<br />
					what the discrepancy,<br />
					what the difference between the recluse Gotama and us,<br />
					that is to say in <i>dhamma</i>-teaching as against <i>dhamma</i>-teaching,<br />
					in instruction as against instruction?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those monks neither rejoiced in nor scoffed at what the wanderers belonging to other sects had said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising from their seats they departed,<br />
					not rejoicing,<br />
					not scoffing,<br />
					but thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We shall learn the meaning of what has been said in the Lord's presence."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks having walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī, returning from the alms-gathering after the meal,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now we, Lord, having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking our bowls and robes,<br />
					entered Sāvatthī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">It occurred to us, Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is too early to walk for almsfood in Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose <a id="pg112"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></a> we were to approach the park of the wanderers belonging to other sects?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So we, Lord, approached the park of the wanderers belonging to other sects and exchanged greetings with the wanderers belonging to other sects,<br />
					and having exchanged greetings of courtesy and friendliness,<br />
					we sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As we were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these wanderers belonging to other sects spoke thus to us:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, the recluse Gotama lays down the full understanding of sense-pleasures;<br />
					we too lay down the full understanding of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, your reverences, herein what is the divergence,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, wanderers belonging to other sects who speak thus should be spoken to thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what, your reverences,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, when wanderers belonging to other sects are questioned in this way,<br />

					<p class="f4">What is the reason for this?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is that it is not within their scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, monks, do not see anyone in the world with its devas,<br />
					Maras and Brahmas,<br />
					in creation<br />
					with its recluses and brahmans,<br />
					its devas and men,<br />
					who could win approbation with his answers to these questions except a <i>Tathāgata</i><br />

					<p class="f4">These five, monks, are the strands of sense-pleasures.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognisable by the ear,<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the peril in sense-pleasures?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />
					a young man of family earns his living by some craft,<br />

					dying of hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is a peril in pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
