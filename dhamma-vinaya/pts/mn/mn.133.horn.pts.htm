					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Tapoda monastery.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Samiddhi,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					getting up when the night was waning,<br />
					went to the Tapoda (lake)<br />
					to bathe his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had bathed his limbs in the Tapoda (lake)<br />
					and had come out (of the water),<br />
					he stood in one robe<br />
					drying his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when the night was far spent,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a certain deva<br />
					illumining with his radiant beauty<br />
					the whole of the Tapoda,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					approached the venerable Samiddhi<br />
					and, having approached,<br />
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was standing at one side,<br />
					this deva spoke thus to the venerable Samiddhi:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg238"><span class="f2 g"><b>[238]</b></span></a> "Do you, monk, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">But do you, friend, remember<br />

					and the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I too, monk, do not remember<br />

					<p class="f4">But do you, monk, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, do not remember<br />

					do you, monk, master<br />

					do you, monk, remember<br />

					and the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the exposition<br />
					and the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious, monk,<br />
					are connected with the goal,<br />
					they are fundamental to the Brahma-faring."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke this deva;<br />
					having said this,<br />
					he disappeared then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Samiddhi<br />
					towards the end of that night<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the venerable Samiddhi<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, revered sir,<br />
					when the night was waning<br />
					went to the Tapoda (lake)<br />
					to bathe my limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had bathed my limbs<br />
					in the Tapoda (lake)<br />
					and had come out (of the water),<br />
					I stood in one robe<br />
					while drying my limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, revered sir, when the night was far spent<br />
					a certain deva<br />

					approached me<br />
					and, having approached,<br />
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was standing at one side,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Do you, monk, remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, do not remember<br />

					<p class="f4">"I too, monk, do not remember<br />

					<p class="f4">But do you, monk, learn<br />

					do you, monk, master<br />

					<p class="f4">For the exposition<br />
					and the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious, monk,<br />
					are connected with the goal,<br />
					they are fundamental to the Brahma-faring."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke this deva;<br />
					having said this,<br />
					he disappeared then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were good, revered sir,<br />
					if the Lord would teach me<br />
					the exposition<br />
					and the analysis<br />
					of the Auspicious."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, monk, listen<br />
					and attend carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir,"<br />
					the venerable Samiddhi answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The past should not be followed after, the future not desired.<br />
							What is past is got rid of and the future has not come.<br />
							But whoever has eye now here, now there, of a present thing,<br />
							Knowing that it is immovable, unshakable, let him cultivate it.<br />
							Swelter at the task this very day. Who knows whether he will die tomorrow?<br />
							There is no bargaining with the great hosts of Death.<br />
							Thus abiding ardently, unwearied day and night,<br />
							He indeed is 'Auspicious' called, described as a sage at peace."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had said this,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the Well-farer rose <a id="pg239"><span class="f2 g"><b>[239]</b></span></a> from his seat<br />
					and entered a dwelling-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Lord had gone,<br />
					it occurred to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, the Lord,<br />
					having recited this exposition to us in brief,<br />
					but not having explained the meaning in full,<br />
					rose from his seat<br />
					and entered a dwelling-place:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"The past should not be followed after, the future not desired.<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, who can explain the meaning in full<br />
					of this exposition that was recited in brief by the Lord<br />
					but the meaning of which was not explained in full?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to these monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now the venerable Kaccāna the Great<br />

					but the meaning of which was not explained in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					were to question him on this meaning?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these monks approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					they exchanged greetings with him,<br />
					and when they had conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					these monks spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend Kaccāna,<br />
					the Lord, having recited this exposition to us in brief<br />
					but not having explained its meaning in full,<br />
					rose from his seat and entered a dwelling-place:</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after the Lord had departed,<br />
					it occurred to us,<br />
					reverend Kaccāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, the Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, who can explain the meaning in full<br />

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to us:</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great,<br />

					<p class="f4">May the venerable Kaccāna the Great explain it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences,<br />
					as a man walking about aiming at the pith,<br />

					even so is this performance of the venerable ones,<br />

					<p class="f4">This was the time<br />

					<p class="f4">"Undoubtedly, reverend Kaccāna,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, your reverence,"<br />

					<p class="f4">The venerable Kaccāna the Great spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> So called because it faced the Tapoda lake. At <i>MA.</i> v. 4 this is called "hot," <i>tatta.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>SA.</i>i. 38, <i>VinA.</i> ii. 512 and see <i>B.D.</i> i. 188, <i>n.</i> 1, 274, <i>n.</i> 6, <i>K.S.</i> i. 14, <i>n.</i> 6. See also <i>S.</i> i. 8 where likewise a <i>devatā</i> spoke to Samiddhi at this place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Probably both the lake and the monastery.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 5-6 explains that in the two preceding Discourses and in the following one the headings <i>(mātikā)</i> and the analysis were made in respect of the five <i>khandhā;</i> but here the headings refer to the 12 (sense-)fields <i>(āyatanā),</i> <i>i.e.</i> the six sensory organs and their six (appropriate) sense-data.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 6 reads with a Burmese edn. <i>nikanti viññāṇa,</i> consciousness that is desire, craving, longing for.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> in "eye," etc. <i>Cf.</i> <i>S.</i> iv. 13 <i>f.</i>, where one rejoices in the six sense-fields.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> It would appear that "eye and material shapes" form a pair, expressed by the word <i>ubhayaṁ.</i> Attachment, etc., is to this (pair), <i>tasmiṁ.</i> So with the ear and sounds, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Ms. Horner has 'vision' here, but it should be the organ as she has it in the following sections.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn3" href="#edfn3">ed3</a>]</sup> This is not repeated in either the Pali or Ms. Horner's translation, but I have repeated it as that is the more usual way such conversations ended. It gives the bhikkhus one more opportunity to clarify their memory.</p>
