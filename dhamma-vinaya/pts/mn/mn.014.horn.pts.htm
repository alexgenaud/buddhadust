<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 14. Mahanama the Sakkyan, lamenting over his state of confusion with regard to pleasures of the senses, is given a detailed exposition of what constitutes the pleasure and the danger of the five senses, the thing that is binding Mahanama to confusion, and the way the Buddha himself escaped such confusion. The Buddha then describes an encounter with some Jains wherein he defeats their claim that the end of pain is to be got through pain by showing them that they are practicing their painful austerities without any support in knowledge or understanding and concludes with a description of the exceptional pleasure which he is able to attain." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans<br />
					at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a><br />
					in Nigrodha's park.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p2">2</a>]</span> Then Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Mahānāma the Sakyan was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time, Lord,<br />
					I have thus understood <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Greed is a depravity of the mind,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					aversion is a depravity of the mind,<br />
					confusion is a depravity of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that I, Lord, understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Greed is a depravity of the mind,<br />
					aversion is a depravity of the mind,<br />
					confusion is a depravity of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But at times things belonging to greed,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to aversion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> to confusion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">It	occurred	to	me thus, Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what can be the quality in me,<br />
					not got rid of subjectively,<br />
					on account of which<br />
					at times things belonging to greed,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to aversion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to confusion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist?'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p3">3</a>]</span> "Indeed there is a quality in you, Mahānāma,<br />
					not got rid of subjectively,<br />
					on account of which<br />
					at times things belonging to greed,<br />
					taking hold of your mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to aversion,<br />
					taking hold of your mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to confusion,<br />
					taking hold of your mind,<br />
					persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this quality could be got rid of subjectively by you, Mahānāma,<br />
					if you would not dwell in a house,<br />
					if you would not enjoy pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as this quality, Mahānāma,<br />
					is not got rid of by you subjectively,<br />
					therefore you dwell in a house<br />
					and enjoy pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p4">4</a>]</span> 'Pleasures of the senses<br />

					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet if this, Mahānāma, comes to be well seen<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					by an ariyan disciple,<br />
					but if he does not come to rapture and joy<br />
					apart from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					or to something better than that,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					then he is not yet one unseduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Mahānāma, an ariyan disciple thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and if this comes to be well seen,<br />

					by the ariyan disciple,<br />
					and if he comes to rapture and joy<br />
					apart from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					and to something better than that,<br />
					then he is one who is not seduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p5">5</a>]</span> And I too, Mahānāma,<br />
					before my awakening<br />
					while I was still the bodhisatta,<br />
					not fully awakened,<br />
					thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and although this came to be well seen thus,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I came to no rapture and joy<br />
					apart from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					nor to anything better than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I was conscious<br />
					that I was not yet one unseduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Mahānāma,<br />
					I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little <a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and when this was well seen thus,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					and I came to rapture and joy<br />
					apart from the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					and to something better than that,<br />
					then was I conscious<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p6">6</a>]</span> And what, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">These five, Mahānāma,<br />

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Mahānāma, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever pleasure,<br />
					whatever happiness arises<br />
					in consequence of these five strands of sense-pleasures,<br />
					this is the satisfaction in sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p7">7</a>]</span> And what, Mahānāma, is the peril in sense-pleasures?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, Mahānāma,<br />
					a young man of family earns his living by some craft,<br />
					such as reckoning on the fingers,<br />
					such as calculation,<br />
					such as computing,<br />
					such as agriculture,<br />
					such as being in a rajah's service,<br />

					<p class="f4">He is afflicted by the cold,<br />
					he is afflicted by the heat,<br />
					suffering from the touch of gadflies,<br />

					creeping things,<br />
					dying of hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Mahānāma, is a peril in pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />

					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p8">8</a>]</span> If, Mahānāma, this young man of family<br />
					rouses himself,<br />
					exerts himself,<br />
					strives thus,<br />
					but if these possessions<br />
					do not come to his hand,<br />
					he grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />
					beating his breast<br />
					and wailing,<br />
					he falls into disillusionment,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed my exertion is vain,<br />

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril<br />

					he experiences suffering and sorrow<br />
					in consequence of looking after them,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now by what means<br />
					may neither kings nor thieves<br />
					take away my possessions,<br />
					nor fire burn them,<br />
					nor water carry them away,<br />
					nor heirs whom I do not like take them away?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Although he looks after these possessions<br />
					and guards them,<br />
					kings do take them away<br />
					or thieves take them away,<br />
					or fire burns them<br />
					or water carries them away,<br />
					or heirs whom he does not like take them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />

					<p class="f4">'I do not even have that which was mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p10">10</a>]</span> And again, Mahānāma, when sense-pleasures are the cause,<br />
					sense-pleasures the provenance,<br />

					kings dispute with kings,<br />
					nobles dispute with nobles,<br />
