<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 14. Mahanama the Sakkyan, lamenting over his state of confusion with regard to pleasures of the senses, is given a detailed exposition of what constitutes the pleasure and the danger of the five senses, the thing that is binding Mahanama to confusion, and the way the Buddha himself escaped such confusion. The Buddha then describes an encounter with some Jains wherein he defeats their claim that the end of pain is to be got through pain by showing them that they are practicing their painful austerities without any support in knowledge or understanding and concludes with a description of the exceptional pleasure which he is able to attain." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a><br />
					in Nigrodha's park.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma the Sakyan<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Mahānāma the Sakyan was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time, Lord,<br />
					I have thus understood <i>dhamma</i> taught by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Greed is a depravity of the mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					aversion is a depravity of the mind,<br />
					confusion is a depravity of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus that I, Lord, understand <i>dhamma</i> taught by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Greed is a depravity of the mind,<br />
					aversion is a depravity of the mind,<br />
					confusion is a depravity of the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But at times things belonging to greed,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to aversion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> to confusion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">It	occurred	to	me thus, Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what can be the quality in me,<br />
					not got rid of subjectively,<br />
					on account of which<br />
					at times things belonging to greed,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to aversion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to confusion,<br />
					taking hold of my mind,<br />
					persist?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed there is a quality in you, Mahānāma,<br />
					not got rid of subjectively,<br />
					on account of which<br />
					at times things belonging to greed,<br />
					taking hold of your mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to aversion,<br />
					taking hold of your mind,<br />
					persist,<br />
					and things belonging to confusion,<br />
					taking hold of your mind,<br />
					persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this quality could be got rid of subjectively by you, Mahānāma,<br />
					if you would not dwell in a house,<br />
					if you would not enjoy pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">But inasmuch as this quality, Mahānāma,<br />
					is not got rid of by you subjectively,<br />
					therefore you dwell in a house<br />
					and enjoy pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet if this, Mahānāma, comes to be well seen as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					by an ariyan disciple,<br />
					but if he does not come to rapture and joy<br />
					apart from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					or to something better than that,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					then he is not yet one unseduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Mahānāma, an ariyan disciple thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and if this comes to be well seen,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom<br />
					by the ariyan disciple,<br />
					and if he comes to rapture and joy<br />
					apart from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					and to something better than that,<br />
					then he is one who is not seduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I too, Mahānāma,<br />
					before my awakening<br />
					while I was still the bodhisatta,<br />
					not fully awakened,<br />
					thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and although this came to be well seen thus,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					I came to no rapture and joy<br />
					apart from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					nor to anything better than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I was conscious<br />
					that I was not yet one unseduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, Mahānāma,<br />
					I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pleasures of the senses<br />
					are of little <a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> satisfaction,<br />
					of much ill,<br />
					of much tribulation<br />
					wherein is more peril,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and when this was well seen thus,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					through perfect intuitive wisdom,<br />
					and I came to rapture and joy<br />
					apart from the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					apart from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					and to something better than that,<br />
					then was I conscious<br />
					that I was one not seduced<br />
					by pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Mahānāma,<br />
					is the satisfaction in pleasures of the senses?</p>

					<p class="f4">These five, Mahānāma,<br />
					are the strands of sense-pleasures.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Material shapes cognisable by the eye,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognisable by the ear,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smells cognisable by the nose,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognisable by the tongue,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touches cognisable by the body,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					liked,<br />
					enticing,<br />
					connected with sensual pleasures,<br />
					alluring.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Mahānāma, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever pleasure,<br />
					whatever happiness arises in consequence of these five strands of sense-pleasures,<br />
					this is the satisfaction in sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Mahānāma, is the peril in sense-pleasures?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, Mahānāma,<br />
					a young man of family earns his living by some craft,<br />
					such as reckoning on the fingers,<br />
					such as calculation,<br />
					such as computing,<br />
					such as agriculture,<br />
					such as being in a rajah's service,<br />
					such as by another craft.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is afflicted by the cold,<br />
					he is afflicted by the heat,<br />
					suffering from the touch of gadflies,<br />
					mosquitoes,<br />
					wind,<br />
					sun,<br />
					creeping things,<br />
					dying of hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Mahānāma, is a peril in pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the provenance,<br />
					being a consequence of pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Mahānāma, this young man of family rouses himself,<br />
					exerts himself,<br />
					strives thus,<br />
					but if these possessions do not come to his hand,<br />
					he grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />
					beating his breast<br />
					and wailing,<br />
					he falls into disillusionment, and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed my exertion is vain,<br />
					indeed my striving is fruitless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the provenance,<br />
					being a consequence of pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Mahānāma, this young man of family rouses himself,<br />
					exerts himself,<br />
					strives thus,<br />
					and these possessions come to his hand,<br />
					he experiences suffering and sorrow in consequence of looking after them,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now by what means may neither kings nor thieves take away my possessions,<br />
					nor fire burn them,<br />
					nor water carry them away,<br />
					nor heirs whom I do not like take them away?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Although he looks after these possessions and guards them,<br />
					kings do take them away<br />
					or thieves take them away,<br />
					or fire burns them<br />
					or water carries them away,<br />
					or heirs whom he does not like take them away.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />
					beating his breast and wailing,<br />
					he falls into disillusionment,<br />
					and thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not even have that which was mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the provenance,<br />
					being a consequence of pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Mahānāma, when sense-pleasures are the cause,<br />
					sense-pleasures the provenance,<br />
					sense-pleasures the consequence,<br />
					the very cause of sense-pleasures,<br />
					kings dispute with kings,<br />
					nobles dispute with nobles,<br />
					brahmans dispute with brahmans,<br />
					householders dispute with householders,<br />
					a mother disputes with her son,<br />
					a son disputes with his mother,<br />
					a father disputes with his son,<br />
					a son disputes with his father,<br />
					a brother disputes with a brother,<br />
					a brother disputes with a sister,<br />
					a sister disputes with a brother,<br />
					a friend disputes with a friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who enter into quarrel,<br />
					contention,<br />
					dispute and attack one another with their hands<br />
					and with stones<br />
					and with sticks<br />
					and with weapons,<br />
					these suffer dying then<br />
					and pain like unto dying.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the provenance,<br />
					being a consequence of pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Mahānāma, when sense-pleasures are the cause,<br />
					sense-pleasures the provenance,<br />
					sense-pleasures the consequence,<br />
					the very cause of sense-pleasures,<br />
					having taken sword and shield,<br />
					having girded on bow and quiver,<br />
					both sides mass for battle<br />
					and arrows are hurled<br />
					and knives are hurled<br />
					and swords are flashing.</p>

					<p class="f4">These who wound with arrows<br />
					and wound with knives<br />
					and decapitate with their swords,<br />
					these suffer dying then<br />
					and pain like unto dying.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />

					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the provenance,<br />
					being a consequence of pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Mahānāma, when sense-pleasures are the cause,<br />
					sense-pleasures the provenance,<br />
					sense-pleasures the consequence,<br />
					the very cause of sense-pleasures,<br />
					having taken sword and shield,<br />
					having girded on bow and quiver,<br />
					they leap on to the newly daubed ramparts,<br />
					and arrows are hurled<br />
					and knives are hurled<br />
					and swords are flashing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who wound with arrows<br />
					and wound with knives<br />
					and pour boiling cow-dung over them<br />
					and crush them with the (falling) portcullis<br />
					and decapitate them with their swords,<br />
					these suffer dying then<br />
					and pain like unto dying.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the provenance,<br />
					being a consequence of pleasures of the senses,<br />
					the very cause of pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Mahānāma, when sense-pleasures are the cause,<br />
					sense-pleasures the provenance,<br />
					sense-pleasures the consequence,<br />
					the very cause of sense-pleasures,<br />
					they break into a house<br />
					and carry off the booty<br />
					and behave as a thief<br />
					and wait in ambush<br />
					and go to other men's wives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kings, having arrested such a one,<br />
					deal out various punishments:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">They lash him with whips<br />
					and they lash him with canes<br />
					and they lash him with (birch) rods,<br />
					and they cut off his hand,<br />

					and they cut off his hand and foot,<br />
					and they cut off his ear,<br />
					and they cut off his nose,<br />
					and they cut off his ear and nose,<br />
					and they give him the 'gruel-pot' punishment,<br />

					<p class="f4">This too, Mahānāma, is a peril in the pleasures of the senses that is present,<br />

					<p class="f4">These, having behaved wrongly in body,<br />

					in thought,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, Mahānāma, is a peril in pleasures of the senses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> that is of the future,<br />
					a stem of ill,<br />
					having pleasures of the senses as the cause,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time I, Mahānāma, was staying near Rājagaha<br />
					on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time several Jains<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on the Black Rock on the slopes of (Mount) Isigili<br />
					came to be standing erect<br />
					and refusing a seat;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they were experiencing feelings that were acute,<br />
					painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Mahānāma,<br />
					having emerged from solitary meditation towards evening,<br />
					approached the slopes of (Mount) Isigili,<br />
					the Black Rock<br />
					and those Jains;<br />
					having approached<br />
					I spoke thus to those Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why do you, reverend Jains,<br />
					standing erect<br />
					and refusing a seat,<br />
					experience feelings that are acute,<br />
					painful<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe?</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had thus spoken, Mahānāma,<br />
					those Jains spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> 'Your reverence, Nāthaputta the Jain is all-knowing,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> all-seeing;<br />
					he claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whether I am walking<br />
					or standing still<br />
					or asleep or awake,<br />
					knowledge-and-vision is permanently and continuously before me."</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there is, Jains,<br />
					an evil deed that was formerly done by you,<br />
					wear it away by this severe austerity.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the non-doing of an evil deed in the future<br />
					is from control of body,<br />
					from control of speech,<br />
					from control of thought<br />
					here, now.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by burning up,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by making an end<br />
					of former deeds,<br />
					by the non-doing<br />
					of new deeds,<br />
					there is no flowing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prom there being no flowing in the future<br />
					is the destruction of deeds;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from the destruction of deeds<br />
					is the destruction of ill;<br />
					from the destruction of ill<br />
					is the destruction of feeling;<br />
					from the destruction of feeling<br />
					all ill will become worn away."</p>

					<p class="f4">And because that is approved of by us<br />
					as well as being pleasing to us,<br />
					therefore we are delighted.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had spoken thus, I, Mahānāma,<br />
					spoke thus to those Jains:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains,<br />
					know<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> that you yourselves were in the past,<br />
					that you were not not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains,<br />
					know that you yourselves did this evil deed in the past,<br />
					that you did not not do it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains,<br />
					know that you did not do an evil deed like this<br />
					or like that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains,<br />
					know that so much ill is worn away,<br />
					or that so much ill is to be worn away,<br />
					or that when so much ill is worn away,<br />
					all ill will become worn away?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But do you, reverend Jains,<br />
					know the getting rid of unskilled states of mind here and now,<br />
					the uprising of skilled states?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not this, your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'From what you say, reverend Jains,<br />
					you do not know then<br />

					<p class="f4">This being so, reverend Jains,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now, reverend Gotama,<br />
