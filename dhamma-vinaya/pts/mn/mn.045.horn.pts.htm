					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered One," these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the undertaking of <i>dhamma</i><br />
					that is happiness in the present<br />
					but results in suffering in the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are, monks, some recluses and brahmans<br />
					who speak like this<br />
					and are <a id="pg369"><span class="f2 g"><b>[369]</b></span></a> of these views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no fault in pleasures of the senses.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These come to indulgence<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> in pleasures of the senses;<br />

					these speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How can these worthy recluses and brahmans,<br />
					seeing future peril among sense-pleasures,<br />
					speak of getting rid of sense-pleasures,<br />
					lay down a full knowledge of sense-pleasures?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Happiness is in the young,<br />
					soft<br />
					and downy arms<br />
					of this girl-wanderer,'</p>

					<p class="f4">these come to indulgence in pleasures of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, having come to indulgence in sense-pleasures,<br />
					at the breaking up of the body after dying<br />
					arise in a sorrowful state,<br />
					a bad bourn,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					Niraya Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here they experience feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					acute.</p>

					<p class="f4">They speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These worthy recluses and brahmans,<br />
					seeing future peril in sense-pleasures,<br />
					speak of getting rid of sense-pleasures<br />
					and lay down a full knowledge of sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">But we, because of sense-pleasures,<br />
					are experiencing these feelings that are painful,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					acute,<br />
					their provenance being sense-pleasures.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, monks,<br />
					in the last month of the hot weather,<br />
					a creeper's seed-pod should burst<br />
					and a seed of the creeper, monks,<br />
					should fall at the root of a sal-tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the <i>devatā</i> residing in that sal-tree,<br />
					afraid,<br />
					agitated,<br />
					might fall a-treinbling.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the friends and acquaintances,<br />
					the kith and kin<br />
					of that <i>devatā</i> who resides in that sal-tree -<br />
					<i>devatās</i> of parks,<br />
					<i>devatās</i> of groves,<br />
					<i>devatās</i> of trees,<br />
					<i>devatās</i> residing in medicinal herbs,<br />
					grasses<br />
					and woods -<br />
					gathering together and assembhng<br />
					might give comfort thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not be afraid, revered one,<br />
					do not be afraid, revered one.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a peacock might swallow this creeper's seed<br />
					or a deer might consume it<br />
					or a forest-fire might burn it<br />
					or workers in the wood might remove it<br />
					or white ants might eat it,<br />
					or it might not germinate.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, if neither a peacock<br />
					should swallow this creeper's seed<br />
					nor a deer consume it<br />
					nor a forest-fire might burn it<br />
					nor workers in the wood might remove it<br />
					nor white ants might eat it,<br />
					it might germinate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rained on heavily by the monsoon clouds,<br />
					it might grow apace,<br />
					and a young,<br />
					soft<br />
					and downy creeper,<br />
					clinging to it<br />
					might fasten on to that sal-tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, <a id="pg370"><span class="f2 g"><b>[370]</b></span></a> monks, it might occur to the <i>devatā</i><br />
					residing in that sāl-tree:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why then, did these worthy friends and acquaintances,<br />
					kith and kin:<br />
					<i>devatā</i>s of parks<br />
					<i>devatās</i> of parks,<br />
					<i>devatās</i> of groves,<br />
					<i>devatās</i> of trees,<br />
					<i>devatās</i> residing in medicinal herbs,<br />

					seeing future peril in this creeper's seed,<br />
					gathering together and assembling,<br />
					give comfort thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not be afraid, revered one,<br />
					do not be afraid, revered one.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a peacock might swallow this creeper's seed<br />
					or a deer might consume it<br />
					or a forest-fire might burn it<br />
					or workers in the wood might remove it<br />
					or white ants might eat it,<br />
					or it might not germinate?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant is the touch<br />
					of this young,<br />
					soft,<br />
					downy<br />
					and clinging creeper.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It might cover that sāl-tree;<br />
					when it had covered that sāl-tree,<br />
					it might form a canopy above it,<br />
					it might produce dense undergrowth;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					when it had produced a dense undergrowth<br />
					it might strangle<br />
					every great branch of that sāl-tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, it might occur to the <i>devatā</i><br />
					residing in that sāl-tree:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It was because of seeing this future peril<br />
					in the creeper's seed<br />
					that those worthy friends and acquaintances,<br />
					kith and kin:<br />

					or it might not germinate.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For I, because of this creeper's seed,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the undertaking of <i>dhamma</i><br />

					<p class="f4">Here, monks, there is some unclothed (ascetic),<br />

					licking his hands (after meals),<br />
					not one to come when asked to do so,<br />
					not one to stand still when asked to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not consent (to accept food) offered to (me)<br />

					<p class="f4">He lives intent on the practice<br />

					<p class="f4">He wares coarse hempen cloths,<br />

					<p class="f4">he is not full of confusion by nature,<br />

					<p class="f4">He, aloof from the pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					entering into the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought<br />
					and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful,<br />
					abides in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, he, by allaying initial and discursive thought,<br />
					his mind subjectively tranquillised<br />
					and fixed on one point,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of concentration<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, he, by the fading out of rapture,<br />
					dwells with equanimity,<br />
					attentive and clearly conscious,<br />
					and experiences in his person<br />
					that joy of which the ariyans say:<br />
					'Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,'<br />
					and he enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the third meditation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, he, by getting rid of joy,<br />
					by getting rid of anguish,<br />
					by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows,<br />
					enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the fourth meditation<br />
					which has neither anguish nor joy,<br />
