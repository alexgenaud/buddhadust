					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Esukārī approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Esukārī the brahman spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahmans, good Gotama,<br />
					lay down four (types of) service:</p>

					<p class="f4">they lay down service for a brahman,<br />
					they lay down service for a noble,<br />
					they lay down service for a merchant,<br />
					they lay down service for a worker.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, good Gotama,<br />
					brahmans lay down service for a brahman,<br />

					<p class="f4">'A brahman may serve a brahman,<br />
					or a noble may serve a brahman,<br />
					or a merchant may serve a brahman,<br />
					or a worker may serve a brahman.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the service, good Gotama,<br />
					that brahmans lay down for a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, good Gotama,<br />
					brahmans lay down service for a noble,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the service, good Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">As to this, good Gotama,<br />
					brahmans lay down service for a merchant,<br />

					<p class="f4">'A merchant may serve a merchant<br />
					or a worker may serve a merchant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the service, good Gotama,<br />
					that brahmans lay down for a merchant.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, good Gotama,<br />

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A worker may serve a worker.</p>

					<p class="f4">For who else could serve a worker?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the <a id="pg367"><span class="f2 g"><b>[367]</b></span></a> service, good Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">Brahmans, good Gotama,<br />
					lay down these four (types of) service.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the good Gotama say about this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, brahman, does everyone agree with the brahmans<br />
