					<p class="f4">At one time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Lord was walking on tour among the Kosalans<br />
					together with a large Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, turning aside from the road,<br />
					smiled (when he came to a) certain place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that the Lord is smiling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not without motive<br />
					do Tathāgatas smile."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					having arranged his robe over one shoulder,<br />
					having saluted the Lord with joined palms,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, revered sir, what is the cause,<br />
					what the reason<br />
					that the Lord is smiling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not without motive<br />
					do Tathāgatas smile."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, Ānanda,<br />
					in this district<br />
					there was a village township called Vebhaḷiŋga,<br />
					prosperous and wealthy<br />
					and crowded with people.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, <span class="mozp">Ānanda</span>, the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					lived depending on the village township of Vebhaḷiŋga,.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, Ānanda,<br />
					the monastery of the Lord Kassapa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> was here.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, ṭnanda,<br />
					the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					instructed an Order of monks while he was seated here."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda, having laid down an outer cloak folded into four,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, revered sir,<br />
					let the Lord sit down.</p>

					<p class="f4">This self-same piece of ground<br />
					will (then) have been made use of<br />
					by two perfected ones,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened Ones."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was seated<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, Ānanda,<br />
					in this district<br />
					there was a village township called Vebhaḷiŋga,<br />
					prosperous and wealthy<br />
					and crowded with people.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, <span class="mozp">Ānanda</span>,<br />
					the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					lived depending on the village township of Vebhaḷiŋga,.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, Ānanda,<br />
					the monastery of the Lord Kassapa was here.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time, ṭnanda,<br />
					the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					instructed an Order of monks while he was seated here."</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda,<br />
					in the village township of Vebhaḷiŋga,<br />
					the potter named Ghaṭīkāra was a supporter -<br />
					the chief supporter -<br />
					of the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda,<br />
					a brahman youth named <a id="pg244"><span class="f2 g"><b>[244]</b></span></a> Jotipāla<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> was a friend -<br />
					a dear friend -<br />
					of the potter Ghaṭīkāra.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda,<br />
					the potter Ghaṭīkāra addressed the brahman youth Jotipāla, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Ānanda,<br />
					the brahman youth Jotipāla spoke thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this little shaveling recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time, Ānanda,<br />
					the potter Ghaṭīkāra addressed the brahman youth Jotipāla, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Ānanda,<br />
					the brahman youth Jotipāla spoke thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this little shaveling recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time, Ānanda, did Ghaṭīkāra the potter<br />
					speak thus to the brahman youth Jotipāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Ānanda,<br />
					the brahman youth Jotipāla spoke thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this little shaveling recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					taking a back-scratcher and bath-powder,<br />
					we will go to the river to bathe.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the brahman youth Jotipāla<br />
					answered the potter Ghaṭīkāra in assent, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">' Yes, dear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the potter Ghaṭīkāra<br />
					and the brahman youth Jotipāla,<br />
					taking a back-scratcher and bath-powder,<br />
					went to the river to bathe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda,<br />
					the potter Ghaṭīkāra spoke thus<br />
					to the brahman youth Jotipāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					is near the monastery<br />
					of the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Ānanda,<br />
					the brahman youth Jotipāla spoke thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this little shaveling recluse?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Ānanda,<br />
					the potter Ghaṭīkāra spoke thus<br />
					to the brahman youth Jotipāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					is near the monastery<br />
					of the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Ānanda,<br />
					the brahman youth Jotipāla spoke thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this little shaveling recluse?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time, Ānanda,<br />
					did Ghaṭīkāra the potter speak thus<br />
					to the brahman youth Jotipāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					is near the monastery<br />
					of the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time, Ānanda,<br />
					did the brahman youth Jotipāla speak thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this Httle shaveling recluse?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the potter Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					having laid hold of the brahman youth Jotipāla by the waist-band,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, dear <a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> Jotipāla,<br />
					is near the monastery<br />
					of the Lord Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda,<br />
					the brahman youth Jotipāla,<br />
					having disengaged his waist-band,<br />
					spoke thus to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					but of what use is it<br />
					to see this little shaveling recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the potter Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					having laid hold of the brahman youth Jotipāla by the hair -<br />
					he had just performed an ablution of his head -<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					is near the monastery<br />
					of the Lord Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					we will approach the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					so as to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, it occurred to the brahman youth Jotipāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it is wonderful,<br />
					indeed it is marvellous,<br />
					that this potter Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					being of lowly birth,<br />
					should lay hold of my hair<br />
					although I have performed an ablution of my head,'<br />
					and thinking:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed this<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> surely cannot be insignificant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">he spoke thus to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it really necessary,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> dear Ghaṭīkāra?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is really necessary, dear Jotipāla,<br />
					most surely a sight of this Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					would be greatly prized by me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					let go (of my hair);<br />
					we will get along.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the potter Ghaṭīkāra<br />
					and the brahman youth Jotipāla<br />
					approached the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had approached,<br />
					Ghaṭīkāra the potter greeted the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					and sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the brahman youth Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda,<br />
					as the potter Ghaṭīkāra was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, this brahman youth Jotipāla is my friend -<br />
					my dear friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Lord teach him <i>dhamma</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted the potter Ghaṭīkāra<br />
					and the brahman youth Jotipāla,<br />
					with talk on <i>dham-</i> <a id="pg246"><span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span></a> <i>ma.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the potter Ghaṭīkāra<br />
					and the brahman youth Jotipāla,<br />
					gladdened,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					delighted by the Lord Kassapa's talk on <i>dhamma,</i><br />
					having rejoiced in what the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, had said,<br />
					having given thanks<br />
					and risen from their seats,<br />
					greeting the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					they departed keeping their right sides towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the brahman youth Jotipāla spoke thus<br />
					to the potter Ghaṭīkāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it that you, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					on hearing this dhamma,<br />
					do not go forth from home into homelessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, dear Jotipala, do you not know<br />
					that I look after my blind and ageing parents?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra,<br />
					I will go forth from home into homelessness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the potter Ghaṭīkāra<br />
					and the brahman youth Jotipāla<br />
					approached the Lord Kassapa;<br />
					having approached and having greeted the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					they sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda, as Ghaṭīkāra the potter<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, this brahman youth Jotipāla is my friend -<br />
					my dear friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Lord let him go forth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, Jotipāla the brahman youth<br />
					received the going forth<br />
					in the presence of the Lord Kassapa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					he received the ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, not long after the brahman youth Jotipāla had received ordination -<br />
					half a month after his ordination -<br />
					the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					having stayed at Vebhaḷiŋga, for as long as he found suitable,<br />
					set out on tour for Benares;<br />
					walking on tour,<br />
					in due course he arrived at Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he was there, Ānanda,<br />
					 the Lord Kassapa, stayed near Benares<br />
					at Isipatana in the deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					heard that the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					had arrived at Benares<br />
					and was staying near Benares at Isipatana in the deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					having had many lovely vehicles harnessed,<br />
					having mounted a lovely vehicle,<br />
					set off for Benares with the many lovely vehicles<br />
					and with great royal pomp<br />
					so as to see the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">For as long as the ground was possible for a vehicle<br />
					he went in the vehicle,<br />
					then having dismounted from it,<br />
					he approached the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, on foot;<br />
					having approached<br />
					and having greeted the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, as Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					roused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					gladdened <a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a><br />
					and delighted him with talk on dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					roused,<br />
					delighted by the Lord Kassapa<br />
					with talk on dhamma,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, may the Lord consent to a meal with me on the morrow<br />
					together with the Order of monks.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī the king of Kāsi,<br />
					having understood the Lord Kassapa's consent,<br />
					rising from his seat<br />
					and greeting the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					departed keeping his right side towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, towards the end of that night when Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					had had sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					prepared in his own dwelling:<br />
					dry yellow rices,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					various curries,<br />
					the black grains removed,<br />
					and various condiments,<br />
					he had the time announced to the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is time, revered sir,<br />
					the meal is ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One,<br />
					having dressed in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					approached the dwelling of Kikī, the king of Kāsi;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat<br />
					together with the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					with his own hand served and satisfied<br />
					with sumptuous foods,<br />
					solid and soft,<br />
					the Order of monks<br />
					with the Awakened One at its head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, when the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One<br />
					had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br />
					Kikī, the king of Kāsi, taking a low seat,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Kikī, the king of Kāsi<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, may the Lord consent to (accept)<br />
					my rains-residence in Benares;<br />
					there will be suitable support for the Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, sire, I have (already) consented<br />
					to (accept) a rains-residence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Kikī, the king of Kāsi<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, may the Lord consent<br />
					to (accept) my rains-residence in Benares;<br />
					there will be suitable support for the Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, sire, I have (already) consented<br />
					to (accept) a rains-residence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time, Ānanda, did Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					speak thus to the Lord Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, may the Lord consent<br />
					to (accept) my rains-residence in Benares;<br />
					there will be suitable support for the Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, sire, I have (already) consented<br />
					to (accept) a rains-residence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One does not consent<br />
					to (accept) my rains-residence in Benares,'<br />
					and he was depressed and grieved.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />
					spoke thus to the Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, have you, revered sir,<br />
					some other supporter than me?</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is, sire, a village township called Vebhaḷiŋga,.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a <a id="pg248"><span class="f2 g"><b>[248]</b></span></a> potter there called Ghaṭīkāra;<br />
					he is my supporter -<br />
					the chief supporter.</p>

					<p class="f4">But you, sire, think:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord Kassapa, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, does not consent<br />
					to (accept) my rains-residence in Benares,<br />
					and you are depressed and grieved.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not so with the potter Ghaṭīkāra<br />
					and nor can it be so.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, sire, the potter Ghaṭīkāra has gone to the Awakened One for refuge,<br />
					he has gone to dhamma for refuge,<br />
					he has gone to the Order for refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ghaṭīkāra, the potter, sire,<br />
					is restrained from onslaught on creatures,<br />
					restrained from taking what has not been given,<br />
					restrained from wrong enjoyment of sense-pleasures,<br />
					restrained from lying speech,<br />
					restrained from occasions of sloth<br />
					engendered by strong drink and spirits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ghaṭīkāra the potter, sire,<br />
					is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Awakened One<br />
					unwavering confidence in dhamma<br />
					unwavering confidence the Order,<br />
					he is possessed of moral habits<br />
					that are dear to the ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ghaṭīkāra the potter, sire, is a one-meal-man,<br />

					<p class="f4">At one time I, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, sire, it occurred to Ghaṭīkāra the potter:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, sire,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Kikī, the king of Kāsi,<br />

					<p class="f4">It may be, Ānanda, that this will occur to you:</p>
