					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					the dear and beloved<br />
					little only son of a certain householder<br />
					had passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">After he had passed away<br />
					he (the father) had no inclination for work<br />
					or for food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going constantly to the cemetery,<br />
					he wailed:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where are you, little only son?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where are you, little only son?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that householder approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus to that householder<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have not you, householder, controlling faculties<br />
					for stilling your own mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a change in your faculties."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son<br />
					has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since he passed away<br />
					I have no inclination for work<br />
					or food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going constantly to the cemetery,<br />
					I wail:<br />
					'Where are you, little only son?<br />
					Where are you, little only son?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is just it, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, householder, grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But for whom, Lord,<br />
					could this hold good in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection?'</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Lord, bliss and happiness<br />
					are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg293"><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></a> Then the householder,<br />
					not rejoicing in what the Lord had said,<br />
					repudiating it,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a number of gamblers were playing dice<br />
					not far from the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that householder<br />
					approached these gamblers;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to these gamblers:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, I, sirs, approached the recluse Gotama;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the recluse Gotama,<br />
					I sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, sirs, the recluse Gotama spoke thus to me<br />
					as I was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Have not you, householder, controlling faculties<br />
					for stilling your own mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a change in your faculties.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son<br />
					has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since he passed away<br />
					I have no inclination for work<br />
					or food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going constantly to the cemetery,<br />
					I wail:<br />
					"Where are you, little only son?<br />
					Where are you, little only son?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is just it, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, householder, grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />

					and despair<br />

					originate in affection.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But for whom, Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />

					<p class="f4">For, Lord, bliss and happiness<br />
					are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, sirs, not rejoicing in what the Lord had said,<br />
					repudiating it,<br />
					rising from my seat,<br />
					departed."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is just it, householder,<br />
					that is just it, householder;<br />
					for, householder,<br />
					bliss and happiness are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is agreement<br />
					between me and the gamblers,"<br />
					departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this subject of conversation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					gradually penetrated the royal palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">And King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					spoke thus to Queen Mallikā:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This was said to these, Mallikā, by the recluse Gotama:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If this, sire, was said by the Lord,<br />
					it is so."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As the recluse Gotama speaks<br />
					so does Mallikā<br />
					because she is much delighted with him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If this, sire, was said by the Lord,<br />
					it is so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as when a teacher speaks to his pupil<br />
					and the pupil is so much delighted with him<br />
					that he says<br />
					'It is just so, teacher,<br />
					it is just so, teacher.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so do you, Mallikā,<br />
					because you are so much delighted<br />
					with what the recluse Gotama says,<br />
					say:<br />
					'If this, sire, was said by the Lord,<br />
					it is so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Be off, Mallikā, go away."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Queen Mallikā<br />
					summoned the brahman Nāḷijaŋgha,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come you, brahman,<br />
					approach the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head<br />
					and ask whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort;<br />
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Queen Mallika salutes the Lord's feet with her head,<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">and then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir,<br />
					were these words spoken by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair<br />
					are born of affection,<br />
					originate in affection?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when you have mastered well<br />
					what the Lord <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> explains to you,<br />
					you must tell me.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Tathāgatas do not speak against the truth."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, madam,"<br />
					and the brahman Nāḷijaŋgha,<br />
					having answered Queen Mallikā in assent,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having conversed in a courteous and friendly way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the brahman Nāḷijaŋgha, spoke thus to the Lord;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Gotama, Queen Mallikā with her head<br />
					salutes the good Gotama's feet<br />
					and asks whether he is well,<br />
					not indisposed,<br />
					of bodily vigour,<br />
					strong,<br />
					abiding in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And she speaks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Revered sir, were these words spoken by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief,<br />
					sorrow,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is just so, brahman,<br />
					it is just so, brahman.</p>

					sorrow,<br />
					suffering,<br />

					are born of affection,<br />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, brahman,<br />

His ablution would then consist in rinsing ceremonially, <i>ācamitva,</i> washing his hands and feet and rinsing out his mouth before he paid his respects to the Teacher.</p>
