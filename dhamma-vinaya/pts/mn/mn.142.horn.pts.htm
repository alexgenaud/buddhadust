					<p class="f4">Then Mahā Pajāpatī<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Gotamid,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					bringing a pair of new cloths,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					she sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, this pair of new cloths<br />
					has been cut out by me<br />
					and woven by me<br />
					specially for the Lord;<br />
					revered sir, may the Lord<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					accept it from me."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Give it to the Order,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Gotami.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you give it to the Order<br />
					I will be honoured<br />
					and the Order too."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, this pair of new cloths<br />
					has been cut out by me<br />
					and woven by me<br />
					specially for the Lord;<br />
					revered sir, may the Lord<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					accept it from me."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Give it to the Order, Gotami.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you give it to the Order<br />
					I will be honoured<br />
					and the Order too."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, this pair of new cloths<br />

					and woven by me<br />
					specially for the Lord;<br />
					revered sir, may the Lord<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					accept it from me."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Give it to the Order, Gotami.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you give it to the Order<br />
					I will be honoured<br />
					and the Order too."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid<br />
					has been of much service to the Lord.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord,<br />

					refrains from lying speech,<br />
					refrains from occasions of sloth induced by intoxicants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord that Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid<br />

					<p class="f4">Revered sir, it is due to the Lord that Mahā Pajāpatī<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda, there are these fourteen offerings<br />
					graded as to individuals.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to a Tathāāgata,<br />
					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One -<br />
					this is the first offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to one enlightened for and by himself alone<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					this is the second offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to a Tathāāgata's disciple<br />
					who is one perfected -<br />
					this is the third offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to one faring along for the realisation<br />
					of the fruit of perfection -<br />
					this is the fourth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to a non-returner -<br />
					this is the fifth offering offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of non-returning -<br />
					this is the sixth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to a once-returner -<br />
					this is the seventh offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of once-returning -<br />
					this is the eighth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to a stream-attainer -<br />
					this is the ninth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of stream-attainment -<br />
					this is the tenth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to one who is beyond and without attachment to sense-pleasures<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					this is the eleventh offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to an ordinary person of moral habit -<br />
					this is the twelfth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to an ordinary person of poor moral habit -<br />
					this is the thirteenth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to an animal -<br />
					this is the fourteenth offering graded as to individuals.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg303"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></a> As to this, Ānanda,<br />
					when a gift has been given<br />
					to an animal,<br />
					it is expected that the offering (yields) a hundredfold.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">when a gift has been given<br />
					to an ordinary person of poor moral habit,<br />
					it is to be expected that the offering (yields) a thousandfold.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a gift has been given<br />
					to an ordinary person of moral habit,<br />
					it is to be expected that the offering (yields) a hundred thousandfold.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a gift<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> has been given<br />
					to one who is beyond and without attachment to sense-pleasures,<br />
					it is to be expected that the offering (yields) a hundred thousandfold of <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#crore">crores.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">When a gift has been given<br />
					to one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of stream-attainment,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it is to be expected that the offering<br />
					(yields) what is incalculable and immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what can be said of the stream-attainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of the one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of once-returning?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of the once-returner?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of non-returning?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of the non-retumer?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of one faring along for the realisation of the fruit of perfection?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of one perfected?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of a Tathāāgata's disciple<br />
					who is one perfected?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of one enlightened for and by himself alone?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can be said of a Tathāāgata, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One?</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And there are these seven kinds of offerings to the Order, Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to both Orders<br />
					with the Awakened One at the head<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					this is the first offering to the Order.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to both Orders<br />
					after the Awakened One has attained final nibbāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					this is the second offering to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to the Order of monks -<br />
					this is the third offering to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift<br />
					to the Order of nuns -<br />
					this is the fourth offering to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift,<br />
					saying,<br />
					'May so many monks and nuns be specified for me by the Order' -<br />
					this is the fifth offering to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">One <a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> gives a gift, saying:<br />
					'May so many monks be specified for me by the Order' -<br />
					this is the sixth offering to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gives a gift, saying,<br />
					'May so many nuns be specified for me by the Order' -<br />
					this is the seventh offering to the Order.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Ānanda, in the distant future<br />
					there will be those of the ariyan clan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the yellow robes around their necks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who will be of bad morality<br />
					and evil character;<br />
					and a gift will be given to the Order<br />
					specially for these of bad morality.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>But when I, Ānanda, say<br />
					that an offering to the Order<br />
					is incalculable<br />
					and immeasurable<br />
					I by no means say<br />
					that a gift graded as to individuals<br />
					is of greater fruit<br />
					than an offering to the Order.</b></p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these four purifications of offerings,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">There is, Ānanda,<br />
					the offering purified by the recipient<br />

					<p class="f4">There is, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">There is, Ānanda,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what offering, Ānanda,<br />

					but not by the recipient?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to this, Ānanda,<br />
					the giver is of moral habit<br />

					the recipients are of poor morality<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is thus, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">These, Ānanda, are the four purifications in offerings."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 66 explains she thought that as she had not given Gotama anything, not even cakes or fruit, in the 29 years he had led a household life she would now give him an outer cloak and a robe, but only what was made by hand would satisfy her. But <i>sāmaɱ vāyitaɱ,</i> according to <i>MA.</i> v. 66, does not mean woven by her own hand, but that every day, surrounded by a group of foster-mothers, she went to the weaving place for women artisans and, taking the movable part of her loom, worked there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> As at <i>Miln.</i> 240, though there she was giving cloths for the rains.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> She was much disappointed; but Gotama, according to <i>MA.</i> v. 67, was acting out of compassion, for what is given to an Order is of great fruit, and a gift given both to him and the Order will twice arouse the three thoughts connected with giving.</p>

							<p><i>pāṭipuggalikā dakkhiṇā,</i> This is saying that this is the way to classify the kammic rebound of gifts according to the individual receiving the gift. That is not to say that the worth and merit of the gift depends entirely on the recipient. The gift itself and the manner in which it is given also contribute to the rebound.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 72 says even a lay-follower gone to the three Refuges is called one faring along for the fruit of stream-attainment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Or <i>Buddhapamukhe</i> may mean with the Buddha facing them or before' them. For <i>MA.</i> v. 73 says "on one side is the Order of monks, on the other the Order of nuns, and the Teacher is sitting in the middle."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> This explains why, if Mahā Pajāpatī gives a gift to the Order, the Lord will be honoured as well as the Order.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> v. 77 says this means a non-returner here, for an arahant is wholly without attachment, <i>ekantavītarāga,</i> therefore a gift given by an arahant to an arahant is the chief of gifts. Because of his being without desire or attachment, a deed done by an arahant is neither skilled nor unskilled but remains in the position of its doing.</p>
