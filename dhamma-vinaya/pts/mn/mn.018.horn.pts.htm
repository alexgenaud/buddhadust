<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 18. The Buddha cuts off an argumentative questioner by telling him that in his teaching there is no arguing with anyone about anything and by this he is free. In repeating the insident to the bhikkhus he is questioned as to what this teaching is that argues with no one about anything. The Buddha explains in brief that it is by having no interest in the obsessions and perceptions that assail the mind. Then further the bhikkhus ask for a clarification of this of Maha Kaccana, who speaks of the obsessions and perceptions that arise from sense experience." />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having walked in Kapilavatthu for almsfood,<br />

					for the day-sojourn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having plunged into the Great Wood,<br />
					he sat down for the day-sojourn<br />
					at the root of a young vilva tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who was always pacing up and down,<br />
					always roaming about on foot,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					having plunged into the Great Wood,<br />

					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the Lord;<br />
					having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					he stood at one side<br />
					leaning on his stick.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at one side<br />
					leaning on his stick,<br />
					the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the teaching<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> of the recluse,<br />

					<p class="f4">"According to my teaching, sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, sir, is my teaching,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand,<br />
					shaking his head<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, emerging from solitude towards evening,<br />
					approached Nigrodha's monastery;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down<br />
					the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, monks, having dressed in the morning,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having walked in Kapilavatthu for almsfood,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having plunged into the Great Wood,<br />
					I sat down for the day-sojourn<br />
					at the root of a young vilva tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand,<br />

					having approached,<br />

					he stood at one side<br />
					leaning on his stick.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at one side<br />
					leaning on his stick,<br />
					the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, spoke thus to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the teaching of the recluse,<br />
					of what views is he?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'According to my teaching, sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, sir, is my teaching,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus,<br />
					a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what is this teaching, Lord,<br />
					whereby the Lord,<br />
					in the world with its devas,<br />

					would not contend with anyone in the world?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is it, Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Whatever is the origin, monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> Here the usual case would have been that the Buddha repeated all that which had been said by Kaccāna the Great.
