					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Cunda the Great,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					emerging towards evening from solitary meditation,<br />
					approached the Lord;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance<br />
					the venerable Cunda the Great spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Those various types of views,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Lord,<br />
					that arise in the world<br />
					and are connected with theories of the self<br />
					or with theories of the world,<br />
					does there come to be ejection of these views,<br />
					does there come to be renunciation of these views<br />
					for a monk who wisely reflects from the beginning?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg52"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span></a> "Those various types of views, Cunda,<br />
					that arise in the world<br />
					and are connected with theories of the self<br />
					or with theories of the world -<br />
					wherever these views arise<br />
					and wherever they obsess (the mind)<br />
					and wherever they are current,<br />
					it is by seeing them with perfect wisdom<br />
					as they really are,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">The situation occurs, Cunda,<br />

					aloof from pleasures of the senses,<br />
					aloof from unskilled states of mind,<br />
					may enter on and abide in the first meditation<br />
					which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought,<br />
					is born of aloofness,<br />
					and is rapturous and joyful.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I fare along<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> by expunging.'</p>

					and abide in<br />
					the second meditation<br />
					which is devoid of initial and discursive thought,<br />

					that joy of which the ariyans say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Joyful lives he<br />

					<p class="f4">and may enter on<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Mentioned with other great theras at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118"><i>M.</i> iii. 78;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p17"><i>A.</i> iii. 299;</a> <i>Ud.</i> 3; <i>Vin.</i> iv. 66. Verses ascribed to him at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p131"><i>Thag.</i> 141-142.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Wrong views are meant, <i>MA.</i> i. 182. Wrong views about self (in connection with the <i>khandhas</i>) number twenty (four for each of the five <i>khandhas</i>). See <i>A.</i> ii. 214, <i>S.</i> iii. 16. Wrong views about the world number eight: that the world and the self are eternal, not eternal, both eternal and not, neither eternal nor not eternal; see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#pg14"><i>D.</i> i. 14</a> <i>ff.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> To think <i>etaɱ mama,</i> this is mine, is to be in the grip of craving.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> To think <i>eso aham asmi,</i> I am this, is to be in the grip of pride.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> To think <i>eso me attā,</i> this is my self, is to be in the grip of wrong view, <i>MA.</i> i. 183.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> At <i>MA.</i> i. 244-5, <i>Vbh.</i> 252 (quoted <i>Asl.</i> 167), <i>Nd.</i> ii. 237, <i>viharati</i> is explained by verbs of motion. The idea is that the expunger moves from higher things to higher.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The plural number is used in reference to the properties of the <i>jhānas</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> See <i>Vism.</i> Ch. X.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>santā ete vihārā ... vuccanti.</i> <i>MA.</i> i. 186 explains <i>santa</i> by <i>nibbuta</i> and <i>sukha,</i> quenched and easeful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>abrahmacārī</i> follow a non-brahma, a low inferior <i>dhamma</i> ... the <i>brahmacāri</i> follow along the course to Brahman, the best (or, as this could be translated, they follow along the highest, <i>brahman,</i> the best course). It also means chastity; see <i>MA.</i> i. 188. The <i>Sallekhasutta</i> is, at <i>DA.</i> 178, given as an example of a Discourse where <i>brahmacariya</i> is defined as <i>methuna-virati.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> See <i>Vin.</i> iii. 178, and <i>B.D.</i> i. 310, <i>n.</i> 1; also <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.015.pali.bd.htm"><i>M.</i> i. 95.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 189 adduces Devadatta as an example.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 189 cites Buddhas and those like Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> These five terms form a series at <i>Vin.</i> i. 63. See <i>B.D.</i> iv. 82.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>aparinibbuto,</i> not utterly quenched, or burnt out, as to the <i>kilesas,</i> <i>A.</i> i. 194.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> That is, to meditate and not to be slothful, <i>MA.</i> i. 196. This exhortation is fairly frequent throughout the Piṭakas, <i>e.g.</i> at <i>M.</i> i. 118. <i>Cf:</i> the "cultivator of empty places" at <i>M.</i> i. 33.</p>
