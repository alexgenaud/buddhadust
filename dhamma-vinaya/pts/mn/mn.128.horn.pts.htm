The Buddha is not able to halt the argument and contention of the sangha in Ghosita's vihara in Kosambī and so moves on to Visit Bhago in Balakallonakara village where he teaches him Dhamma and then he visits the Anuruddhas staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove there. There he teaches the Anuruddhas in great detail the process of eliminating the obstructions to clairvoyant sight and describes the method of jhana practice in threes which he himself used to attain arahantship." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a><br />
					in Ghosita's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the monks of Kosambī,<br />
					who were disputatious,<br />
					quarrelsome<br />
					and contentious,<br />
					lived wounding one another<br />
					with the weapons of the tongue.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk approached the Lord;<br />
					<a id="pt153" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg153"><span class="f2">[153]</span></a> having approached and greeted the Lord,<br />
					he stood at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was standing at a respectful <a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> distance, this monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, the monks of Kosambī,<br />
					who are disputatious,<br />
					quarrelsome<br />
					and contentious,<br />
					live wounding one another<br />
					with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, revered sir, if the Lord<br />
					out of compassion<br />
					were to approach these monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord approached those monks<br />
					and having approached,<br />
					he spoke thus to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, monks;<br />
					no disputes,<br />
					no quarrels,<br />
					no contention,<br />
					no argument."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					a certain monk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord,<br />
					the Dhamma-master, wait;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord,<br />
					untroubled,<br />
					abide intent<br />
					on abiding in ease here and now,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for it is we who will be (held) accountable<br />
					for this dispute,<br />
					quarrel,<br />
					contention<br />
					and argument."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Lord spoke thus to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, monks;<br />
					no disputes,<br />
					no quarrels,<br />
					no contention,<br />
					no argument."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time did that monk speak thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord,<br />
					the Dhamma-master, wait;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord,<br />
					untroubled,<br />
					abide intent<br />
					on abiding in ease here and now,<br />
					for it is we who will be (held) accountable<br />
					for this dispute,<br />
					quarrel,<br />
					contention<br />
					and argument."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Lord spoke thus to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, monks;<br />
					no disputes,<br />
					no quarrels,<br />
					no contention,<br />
					no argument."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time did that monk speak thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Revered sir, let the Lord,<br />
					the Dhamma-master, wait;<br />
					revered sir, let the Lord,<br />
					untroubled,<br />

					for it is we who will be (held) accountable<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having dressed early in the morning,<br />
					taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Kosambī for almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having walked in Kosambī for almsfood<br />
					and returning from the alms-gathering<br />
					after the meal,<br />
					he packed away his lodging<br />
					and, taking his bowl and robe,<br />
					spoke these verses as he was standing:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt154" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg154"><span class="f2">[154]</span></a>"When all in chorus bawl, none feels a fool,<br />
							nor though the Order is divided, thinks otherwise.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">With wandering wits the wiseacres range all the field of talk;<br />
							with mouths agape to full extent, what leads them on they know not.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They who (in thought) belabour this: That man<br />
							has me abused, has hurt, has worsted me,<br />
							has me despoiled: in these wrath's not allayed.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They who do not belabour this: That man<br />
							has me abused, has hurt, has worsted me,<br />
							has me despoiled: in them is wrath allayed.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"> <a id="pg199"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span></a> Nay, not by wrath are wrathful moods allayed here (and) at any time,<br />
							but by not-wrath are they allayed: this is an (ageless) endless rule.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Some others don't discern that here we straitened are (in life, in time),<br />
							but those who do discern, thereby their quarrels are allayed.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Ruffians who maim and kill, steal cattle, steeds,<br />
							and wealth, who plunder realms - for these is concord.<br />
							Why should there not be for you?</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If one find friend with whom to fare<br />
							Rapt in the well-abiding, apt,<br />
							surmounting dangers one and all,<br />
							with joy fare with him mindfully.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Finding none apt with whom to fare,<br />
							none in the well-abiding rapt,<br />
							as rajah quits the conquered realm,<br />
							fare lonely as bull-elephant in elephant-jungle.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Better the faring of one alone<br />
							than companionship with the foolish;<br />
							fare lonely, unconcerned, working no evil,<br />
							as bull-elephant in elephant-jungle."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, having spoken these verses<br />
					as he was standing,<br />
					approached Bālakaloṇakāra village.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that <a id="pt155" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg155"><span class="f2">[155]</span></a> time<br />
					the venerable Bhagu was staying in Bālakaloṇakāra village.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhagu<br />
					saw the Lord coming from afar;<br />
					seeing him,<br />
					he made ready a seat<br />
					and water for the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down on the seat made ready,<br />
					and as he was sitting down<br />
					he bathed his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Bhagu,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord spoke thus<br />
					to the venerable Bhagu<br />
					as he was sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, monk,<br />
					things are going well with you,<br />
					I hope you are keeping going,<br />
					I hope you are not short of almsfood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Things are going well with me, Lord,<br />
					I am keeping going, Lord,<br />
					and I, revered sir,<br />
					am not short of almsfood."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord, <a id="pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a><br />
					having delighted,<br />
					rejoiced,<br />
					roused,<br />
					gladdened<br />
					the venerable Bhagu with talk on dhamma,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					approached the Eastern Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila<br />
					were staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">The keeper of the grove<br />
					saw the Lord coming in the distance,<br />
					and seeing him<br />
					he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, recluse,<br />
					enter this grove;<br />
					there are three young men of family staying here<br />
					desiring Self;<br />
					do not cause them discomfort."</p>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					heard the keeper of the grove<br />
					conferring with the Lord;<br />
					on hearing him,<br />
					he spoke thus to the keeper of the grove:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do not, good grove-keeper,<br />
					impede the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is our Teacher,<br />
					the Lord,<br />
					who is arriving."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					approached the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila,<br />
					and having approached<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go forward, venerable ones,<br />
					go forward, venerable ones,<br />
					our Teacher,<br />
					the Lord,<br />
					is arriving."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					and the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila,<br />
					went out to meet the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">One received his bowl and robe,<br />
					one made ready a seat,<br />
					one set out water for the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord sat down<br />
					on the seat made ready;<br />
					as he was sitting down<br />
					the Lord bathed his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then these venerable ones,<br />
					having greeted the Lord,<br />
					sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the venerable Anuruddha<br />
					was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope things are going well with you, Anuruddhas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I hope you are keeping going,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt156" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg156"><span class="f2">[156]</span></a> "Things are going well with us, Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I hope that you, Anuruddhas,<br />
					are living all together<br />
					on friendly terms<br />
					and harmoniously,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, certainly, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">"As to this, revered sir,<br />
					it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed it is a gain for <a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> me,<br />

					<p class="f4">Because of this, revered sir,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>obhāsa.</i> See Intr., p. xxi; <i>P.T.C.</i> s.v. <i>obhāsa</i> for further references; and also <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p64"><i>A.</i> iv. 302</a> where <i>obhāsa</i> occurs and is translated at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/08_eights/an08.064.hare.pts.htm"><i>G.S.</i> iv. 201</a> by E.M. Hare as "auras," and he quotes the <i>Comy.;</i> "rays known to the clairvoyant." The "clairvoyant" must be understood as one who, in meditation, has won the knowledge of <i>deva</i>-vision; it is with this that he "sees," <i>cf.</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 207: <i>dibbacakkhunā rūpadasmnañ ca sañjānāma.</i> Nyanatiloka, in <i>Bud. Dicty.,</i> says, s.v. <i>obhāsa,</i> "Effulgence of light, Aura appearing at times during deep Insight (vipassanā) may become a 'defilement of insight,' <i>vipassanūpakkilesa.</i>" <i>Obhāsa</i> is a difficult word for a translator and its meaning or meanings, for these seem to vary from context to context, need further investigation. "Effulgence of light" is perhaps rather too strong, and "aura" can hardly be accepted as the right rendering. Nor will "light" do for, though light is implied, there is the definite and important word <i>āloka.</i> This and <i>obhāsa</i> occur in the same passage at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.11.pali.bd.htm#pg220"><i>D.</i> i, 220</a> and certainly appear to have different meanings. At <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg120"><i>M.</i> iii. 120</a> I have translated <i>obhāsa</i> in a context that has nothing to do with meditation as "radiance," that is "effulgence of light," and for the above I tentatively suggest light-manifestation or light-radiation; see under <i>avabhāsa</i> in the Skrt. lexicons. According to <i>MA.</i> iv. 207 the <i>obhāsa</i> in this passage is preparatory, <i>parikammobhāsa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>dassana,</i> appearance, showing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This appears to mean they are perceived extra-sensibly for <i>MA.</i> iv. 207 says "We perceive the appearance of material shapes through <i>deva</i>-vision ... seeing a variety of material shapes through <i>deva</i>-vision," and the whole passage points to processes in meditation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>nimitta.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> According to <i>MA.</i> iv. 207 this is <i>parikamma-samādhi,</i> preparatory concentration. <i>Cavi,</i> which I have here rendered as "fell away," is the aorist of <i>cavati,</i> a verb used regularly for the passing, deceasing or falling from one existence (to be reborn in another). Above however it is clearly not being used in this special sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>amanasikāra.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> I follow the v.l.'s <i>tato nidānaṃ</i> in preference to the text's <i>ubhatonidānaṃ,</i> from both sources, perhaps thinking of the two murderers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>ubbilla</i> pleasurable excitement. The word appears to occur only here in the Pali canon, although <i>ubbillāvitatta</i> occurs at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.022.pali.bd.htm#pg140"><i>M.</i> i. 140</a> and a few other passages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>abhijappā,</i> explained at <i>MA.</i> iv. 208 by <i>taṇhā,</i> arising when one has made the light, <i>āloka,</i> increase as far as the confines of the <i>deva</i>-world and has seen a company of <i>devas</i>. The word also occurs at <i>Dhs.</i> 1059, <i>Vbh.</i> 361.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> None of these states appears as a defilement of the mind, <i>cittassa upakkilesa,</i> at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p7"><i>M.</i> i. 36.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>rūpanimitta.</i> Probably <i>nimitta</i> is here the reflex-image which, by means of certain exercises in concentration, appears as if seen by the eye.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>paritta obhāsa,</i> explained at <i>MA.</i> iv. 209 as <i>parittakammaṭṭṭhāne obhāsaṃ</i> light-manifestation in regard to a limited object of meditational exercise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> These are usually taken to be the first three of the following modes of concentration, <i>samādhi.</i> At <i>Kvu.</i> 413 it is agreed that these three (forms of) <i>samādhi</i> were spoken of by the Lord: <i>e.g.</i> at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.33.03.olds.bd.htm#p3.50">D. iii. 219,</a> above <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.120.horn.pts.htm#pg102">(<i>M.</i> iii. 102),</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm#p3"><i>S.</i> iv. 360,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p63"><i>A.</i> iv. 300</a> which last is identical with <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.026.pali.bd.htm"><i>M.</i> iii. 162</a> and appears to speak of seven forms of samadhi. At <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm#p3"><i>S.</i> iv. 360, 302-363</a> the three forms, among a number of other attainments, are called the Way leading to the Uncompounded. See also <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p41"><i>A.</i> iv. 440 <i>ff.,</i></a> <i>Miln.</i> 337, <i>Vism.</i> 96; and <i>Pts.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> This has reference to the fivefold system of <i>jhāna,</i> obtained by successive instead of simultaneous elimination of <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara</i>. This happens in the second <i>jhāna,</i> but the "three (forms of) <i>samādhi</i> in <i>jhāna</i> occur both in the (more usual) fourfold system of <i>jhāna</i> as well as in the fivefold," <i>MA.</i> iv. 209.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>sappītika.</i> This belongs to the second and third <i>jhānas,</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 209, but according to <i>AA.</i> ii. 153 it is the happiness, <i>sukha,</i> of the first and second <i>jhānas.</i> This, and the three succeeding forms of concentration are also mentioned at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.063.pali.bd.htm#pg300"><i>A.</i> iv. 300 <i>f.,</i></a> while at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/02_twos/an02.140-149.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> i. 91</a> they form two of the various forms of happiness, <i>dve sukhāni:</i> the happiness without rapture being chief over that with rapture, and the happiness of even-mindedness or equanimity being chief over the happiness of delight, <i>sāta.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> The <i>samādhi</i> of the third and fourth <i>jhānas,</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 209; the sukha of these at <i>AA.</i> ii. 153.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> <i>sāta;</i> again belonging to the third and fourth <i>jhānas,</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 209; but <i>AA.</i> ii. 153 discriminates, saying <i>sātasukha</i> is happiness among the three <i>jhānas,</i> while <i>upekhāsukha</i> is the happiness of the fourth <i>jhāna.</i> At <i>Vism.</i> 86 <i>sukha</i> takes the place of <i>sāta.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>upekhā.</i> <i>MA.</i> iv. 209 says "this belongs to the fourth <i>jhāna</i> in the fourfold system, and to the fifth in the fivefold system. But when did the Lord develop this threefold <i>samādhi?</i> During the last watch (of the night) when he was sitting at the root of the great Bo-tree, His first Way is connected with the first <i>jhāna,</i> his second, third and fourth Ways with the second, third and fourth <i>jhānas.</i> In the fivefold system there is no way of the fifth <i>jhāna.</i>" Are the three modes of <i>samādhi</i> really (1) that connected with initial and discursive thought, (2) that connected with rapture, (3) that connected with delight and equanimity? (Or are they taken to be so in this Discourse?) On this point see the numbered classification of <i>samādhi</i> at <i>Vism.</i> 85. See also above, Intr., p. xxii.</p>
