					<p class="f4">At one time the venerable <span class="mozp">Kaccāna</span> the Great was staying near Madhurā in the Gundā Grove.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Avantiputta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> king of Madhurā, heard that the recluse Kaccāna was staying near Madhurā in the Gundā Grove and<br />
					that of that revered Kaccāna<br />
					a lovely report had gone forth thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is clever,<br />
					experienced,<br />
					wise,<br />
					one who has heard much,<br />
					a brilliant speaker,<br />
					of lovely intelligence,<br />
					senior<br />
					as well as being a perfected one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good is the sight of perfected ones like this.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Avantiputta, king of Madhurā,<br />
					having had many splendid vehicles harnessed,<br />
					having mounted a splendid vehicle,<br />
					set out from Madhurā<br />
					with the many splendid vehicles<br />
					and with great royal pomp<br />
					so as to see the venerable Kaccāna the Great.</p>

					<p class="f4">He went by vehicle as long as the ground was passable,<br />
					then, having dismounted from the vehicle,<br />
					he approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great on foot;<br />
					having approached,<br />
					he exchanged greetings with the venerable Kaccāna the Great;<br />
					and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way,<br />
					he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting down at a respectful distance,<br />
					Avantiputta, king of Madhurā,<br />
					spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good Kaccāna,<br />
					brahmans speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Only brahmans form the best caste,<br />
					all other castes are low;<br />
					only brahmans form the fair caste,<br />
					all other casts are dark;<br />
					only brahmans are pure,<br />
					not non-brahmans;<br />
					brahmans are own sons of Brahmā,<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					born of Brahmā, formed by Brahmā, heirs to Brahmā.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What does the reverend Kaccāna say to this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sire, this is merely a sound in the world, that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Only brahmans <a id="pg274"><span class="f2 g"><b>[274]</b></span></a> form the best caste,<br />

					only brahmans form the fair caste,<br />

					only brahmans are pure,<br />
					not non-brahmans;<br />
					brahmans are own sons of Brahmā,<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					born of Brahmā, formed by Brahmā, heirs to Brahmā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a way in which it can be said, sire, that this is merely a sound in the world, that:</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think about this, sire?</p>

					<p class="f4">"But where, good Kaccāna, is this Lord staying now,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Sire, this Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Good Kaccāna, if we should hear that that Lord were ten ... twenty thirty ... forty ... fifty yojana distant we should go the fifty yojana<br />

					<p class="f4">And, good Kaccāna,<br />
					even if we heard that the Lord were a hundred yojana distant,<br />
					we should go the hundred yojana<br />

					perfected one,<br />
					fully Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, good Kaccāna,<br />
					since the Lord has attained final nibbāna,<br />
					we are going for refuge to that Lord<br />
					who has attained final nibbana<br />
					and to dhamma<br />
