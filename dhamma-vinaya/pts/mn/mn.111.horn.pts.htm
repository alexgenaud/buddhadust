					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>anupada</i> is continuous, or uninterrupted, "the next step following."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>paṇḍita,</i> clever or wise. For this and the following words for wisdom (spoken to Sāriputta) see <i>S.</i> i. 191. <i>MA.</i> iv. 82 says he was skilled in the <i>dhātu,</i> the <i>āyatana,</i> dependent origination and in causal occasion and what is not causal occasion (<i>ṭhānāṭhāna,</i> or, the possible and the impossible), with which <i>cf. M.</i> iii. 62.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>mahāpañña.</i> <i>Cf. Pts.</i> ii. 190, <i>MA.</i> iv. 83 which enumerate various kinds of "great wisdom," such as in the moral habits, concentration, freedom, the knowlcdge and vision of freedom, the causal occasion and what is not, attainments in the great abidings, the ariyan truths, the 37 things helpful to enlightenment, the fruits of recluseship, the super-knowledges and the great incomparable Nibbāna. See also <i>A.</i> ii. 67.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>puthupañña.</i> <i>Cf. Pts.</i> ii. 191, <i>MA.</i> iv. 83, the same as <i>mahāpañña</i> but with some additions. See also <i>A.</i> i. 131, ii. 67.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>hāsupañña.</i> <i>Cf. S.</i> v. 376, <i>Pts.</i> ii. 199. The word <i>hāsu</i> would appear from <i>MA.</i> iv. 84 and <i>Pts.</i> to be connected with contentment and rapture in fulfilling the <i>sīla,</i> the control of the sense-organs, moderation in eating, vigilance, and the body of moral habits, concentration, wisdom and freedom. <i>Cf. hasati,</i> to be glad. <i>Hāsa</i> also found in <i>Dhs., e.g.</i> §9, 86, etc., in definition of <i>pīti,</i> rapture.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>javanapañña.</i> <i>Cf. S.</i> v. 376-377, <i>Pts.</i> ii. 200. <i>MA.</i> iv. 84: he hastens quickly (in knowing) that all the <i>khandhā</i> are impermanent, suffering, not-self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>tikkhapañña.</i> <i>Cf. M.</i> i. 11, <i>D.</i> iii. 126 and also see <i>A.</i> i. 45. <i>MA.</i> iv. 85: he quickly cuts through the defilements, and gets rid of evil unskilled states of mind, attachment, aversion and confusion, etc., that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>nibbedhikapañña;</i> <i>cf. Pts.</i> ii. 201 <i>ff.,</i> and for references see <i>P.E.D.</i> All these forms of wisdom are mentioned at <i>S.</i> i. 63 (again of Sāriputta) and at <i>Jā.</i> iv. 136. See <i>K.S.</i> i. 88, <i>n.</i> 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Sāriputta then gained arahantship in a fortnight, <i>MA.</i> iv. 86; also <i>MA.</i> iii. 203, <i>DA.</i> 418, <i>DhA.</i> i. 97.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> See <i>Dhs.</i> 2-6. 278-282, 366-370.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> See <i>Dhs.</i> 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>Dhs.</i> 153.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Dhs.</i> 1334.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>anupadavavatthitā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>anupāya.</i> The following sequence of terms occurs also at <i>M.</i> iii. 30.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>anapāya.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>anissita, i.e.</i> of craving and wrong views, <i>MA.</i> iv. 89.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>apaṭibaddha, i.e.</i> by attachment and desire.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>vippamutta, i.e.</i> from attachment to sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> visaɱyutta, i.e. from the four yokes or all the defilements, <i>MA.</i> iv. 89.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>vimariyādikatena cetasā; cf. S.</i> iii. 31. Unconfined because of what it has eliminated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>Cf. M.</i> i. 38, and see <i>M.L.S.</i> i. 48, <i>n.</i> 7. But here it means, not Nibbāna, but the next excellent attainment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The textual reading, <i>passi vedanā,</i> is unintelligible to me. Neumann appears to give "Reinheit." The Comy. is silent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>cetaso anābhogo,</i> impassivity of thought, lack of mental interest, lack of ideation, lack of inclination. See <i>Pts. Contr.,</i> p. 221, <i>n.</i> 4 on <i>ābhoga;</i> and see <i>Vism.</i> 164, quoted at <i>MA.</i> iv. 90 to show that <i>cetaso ābhogo,</i> which was present in the third <i>jhāna,</i> is absent in the fourth. <i>Cf.</i> also <i>Vbh.</i> 307, quoted <i>Kvu.</i> 425, <i>pañca vññāṇā anābhogā;</i> and <i>MA.</i> ii. 63 <i>anāvattano anābhogo. B.H.S.D.</i> under <i>anābhoga</i> suggests "effortless" (adj.) and "Non-effort, impassivity" (subst.); see also s.v. <i>ābhoga.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>pāramippatta. Pāramī,</i> excellence, perfection, accomplishment, going beyond. <i>MA.</i> iv. 91 gives <i>nipphattipatta,</i> attained accomplishment, completion, perfection.</p>
