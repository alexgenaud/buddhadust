<meta name="description" content="The I.B. Horner translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 7. The Buddha likens a dirty cloth incapable of taking dye to the mind corrupted by greed and covetousness, malevolence, anger, malice, hypocrisy, spite, envy, stinginess, deceit, treachery, obstinacy, impetuosity, arrogance, price and conceit — incapable of attaining a good rebirth. He then likens the cleansing of a dirty piece of cloth that renders it capable of taking dye to the process of cleansing the mind of these corruptions, and he describes this cleansing process." />

					<p class="f4">When this had been said,<br />
					the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is excellent, good Gotama;<br />
					it is excellent, good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright<br />
					what had been upset,<br />
					or disclose what had been covered,<br />
					or show the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or bring an oil lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes;<br />
					even so<br />
					in many a figure<br />
					has <i>dhamma</i> been made clear by the good Gotama,<br />
					I,<br />
					even I,<br />
					am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br />
					and to <i>dhamma</i>,<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I receive the going forth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Sundarika-Bhāradvājai received the going forth<br />

					<p class="f4">Soon after he had been ordained<br />

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Called at <i>MA.</i> i. 165 Vatthasutta. It states that there are four ways of presenting a similitude or parable in relation to its meaning; here the simile is given first, then the meaning.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>The 'bad bourn' for a bad bhikkhu is not the same as the bad born of a layman committing the same offense; the bhikkhu always carries the extra weight of being a representative of the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Niraya Hell, animal birth or the realm of the departed <i>(petavisaya).</i> These bad bourns are alike for householders and the homeless (recluses) if their conduct is bad in the ways specified at <i>MA.</i> i. 167-168.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>This distinction is meaningless or perniciously misleading. With the exception of 'the three great families' which is not mentioned at all in the suttas, which is not a timeless phenomena, and which is likely an invention of the commentator or a common myth, there are examples of laymen attaining all of these rebirths and they are, in any case, all subsumed under the heading of 'greatness as a deva'. The point of making a commentary is to open up the meaning of a sutta not cloud it over with superstition and rumor.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> A householder arises to greatness as a man and greatness as a deva <i>(manussamahattam pi devamahattam pi).</i> A homeless one, if he has certain qualifications, arises in the three great families in the human world or among the six Kāmāvacara devas, or among the ten Brahma-abodes, or in the five Pure Abodes, or in the four formless (realms), <i>MA.</i> i. 168.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Greed is the passion of delight for one's own possessions, covetousness that for another's possessions, <i>MA.</i> i. 169.</p>

						<div class="floatlpp wpx200 mart6">
							<p><i>Akālika.</i> It means this and it also means that the Dhamma is applicable accross time (not restricted to a time or place), and, in it's sense as a synonym of <i>Nibbāna</i> mean that the state attained is not bound to or subject to Time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>akālika,</i> not belonging to time. The meaning is: of immediate fruit. The fruit is immediately followed by the Way (without any interval of time). On these terms see <i>Vism.</i> 198-221.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>saññāgata.</i> According to <i>MA.</i> i. 176 <i>nibbāna</i> is this farther escape for one who has perception of the four <i>brahmavihāras</i> (referred to just above).

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Quoted at <i>DA.</i> i. 139. Phaggu is an auspicious constellation, and so the word has here been translated "auspicious." <i>MA.</i> i. 179 explains by saying that the brahman view is that whoever bathes in the month of Phagguna on the day after the full moon is cleansed of evil done during the year. <i>Uposatha,</i> here translated "holy," has no good English equivalent. Ordinarily there are four uposatha days a month when people observe the higher <i>sīla</i> or fast. But for the pure every day, not necessarily only the four prescribed days, is <i>uposatha,</i> an "observance" day when all the observances and rules of discipline are observed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Purity by way of speech.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Purity by way of gesture or body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>udapāna.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> <i>pabbajjā,</i> the initial entry or lesser ordination into the Order. [Ed.: See also: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-81.htm">Buddhism in Translations § 81</a>]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> <i>upasampadā,</i> the subsequent or higher ordination, not necessarily "final," as it was possible to return to "the low life of the layman." On the ordination ceremony and the regulations for carrying it out in the prescribed way, see <i>Vin.</i> Mahavagga I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 179, as to the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 180, with ardour in physical and mental energy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 180 says "by absence of longing as to the body and the life-principle."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> <i>MA.</i> i. 180 calls this culmination of the Brahma-faring or the Way the "fruit of arahantship." At <i>M.</i> i. 197, 205 freedom of mind is said to be the goal and culmination.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> Those by birth and those by habits: both meant here, <i>MA.</i> i, 180 as at <i>MA.</i> i. 111.</p>
