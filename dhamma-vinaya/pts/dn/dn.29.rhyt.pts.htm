					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was at one time sojourning among the Sākyans,<br />

					of the Sakyan family named The Archers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Nāthaputta the Nigantha<br />

					<p class="f4">And at his death<br />

					<p class="f4">"How shouldst thou understand it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly the Nigaṇṭhas,<br />

					showed themselves shocked,<br />
					repelled and indignant<br />
					at the Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					so badly was their doctrine and discipline<br />
					set forth and imparted,<br />
					so ineffectual was it for guidance,<br />
					so little conducive to peace,<br />
					imparted as it had been<br />
					by one who was not supremely enlightened,<br />

					and without a protector.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now Cunda the Novice,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having passed the rainy season at Pāvā,<br />
					came to see the venerable Ānanda at Sāmāgama,<br />
					and coming,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nāthaputta, sir,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					has just died at Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he being dead,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas have become disunited<br />
					and divided into two parties,<br />
					in mutual strife and conflict,<br />
					quarrelling and wounding each other<br />
					with wordy weapons: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thou dost not understand this doctrine and discipline;<br />
					but I do understand it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How shouldst thou understand it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thou art in the wrong;<br />

					<p class="f4">'I am speaking to the point;<br />

					<p class="f4">'Thou sayest last<br />

					<p class="f4">Truly the Nigaṇṭhas,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of the white robe,<br />

					so little conducive to peace,<br />
					imparted as it had been<br />
					by one who was not supremely enlightened,<br />
					now wrecked as it was<br />
					of his support<br />
					and without a protector."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the venerable Ānanda<br />
					to Cunda the Novice:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Cunda,<br />
					this is a worthy subject<br />
					to bring before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let's go to him,<br />
					and tell him about it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, sir", replied Cunda the Novice.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and Cunda the Novice<br />
					sought out the Exalted One<br />
					and saluting him,<br />
					and sitting down beside him,<br />
					said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nāthaputta, sir,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					has just died at Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he being dead,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas have become disunited<br />

					<p class="f4">'How shouldst thou understand it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thou art in the wrong;<br />

					<p class="f4">'I am speaking to the point;<br />

					<p class="f4">'Thou sayest last<br />
					what should be said first,<br />

					<p class="f4">'What thou hast so long excogitated<br />

					<p class="f4">'Thy challenge is taken up;<br />
					thou'rt proved to be wrong!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Begone to get rid of thy opinion,<br />
					or disentangle thyself if thou canst!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly the Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					followers of Nāthaputta,<br />
					were out methinks to kill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of the white robe,<br />
					who followed Nāthaputta,<br />
					showed themselves shocked,<br />

					so badly was their doctrine and discipline<br />

					and without a protector."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt119" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg119"><span class="f2">[119]</span></a> 4. (The Buddha:) "Here, Cunda, we have a teacher<br />
					who was not supremely enlightened,<br />
					and a doctrine badly set forth,<br />
					badly imparted,<br />
					ineffectual to guide,<br />
					not conducing to peace,<br />
					imparted by one<br />
					who was not supremely enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a doctrine, moreover,<br />
					the disciple does not come to master<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the lesser corollaries<br />
					that follow from the larger doctrine,<br />
					<a id="pg113"><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span></a> nor to acquire correct conduct,<br />
					nor to walk according to the precepts,<br />
					but is perpetually evading that doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him one might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, thou hast got [thy gospel],<br />
					and thou hast got thy opportunity.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thy teacher is not supremely enlightened;<br />
					his Norm is badly set forth,<br />
					badly imparted,<br />
					ineffectual for guidance,<br />
					not conducive to peace,<br />
					not imparted by one supremely enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thou in that doctrine<br />
					hast not mastered the lesser corollaries<br />
					that follow from the larger doctrine,<br />
					nor acquired correct conduct,<br />
					nor walkest thou<br />
					according to those corollaries,<br />
					but thou dost perpetually evade that doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, both that teacher<br />
					and that doctrine<br />
					are shown blame­worthy,<br />
					but the disciple is praiseworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now he who should say to such a disciple:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, your reverence,<br />
					practise even according to the doctrine taught<br />
					and declared by your teacher!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Both he who instigates,<br />
					and he who is instigated,<br />
					and he too who,<br />
					being instigated,<br />
					practises accordingly, -<br />
					they all of them generate much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because their doctrine and discipline<br />
					are badly set forth,<br />
					badly imparted,<br />
					ineffectual for guidance,<br />
					not conducive to peace,<br />
					not imparted by one supremely enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. But consider, Cunda,<br />
					where, the teacher<br />
					not being supremely enlightened,<br />
					and the doctrine being badly set forth,<br />
					badly imparted,<br />
					ineffectual for guidance,<br />
					not conducive to peace,<br />
					not imparted by one supremely enlightened,<br />
					the disciple abides in that doctrine,<br />
					practising the lesser corollaries<br />
					following on the larger doctrine,<br />
					acquiring correct conduct and,<br />
					walking according to the precepts,<br />
					perpetually conforms to that doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him one might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, thou hast been unlucky<br />
					[in thy teacher],<br />
					and in thy opportunity;<br />
					thy teacher is not supremely <a id="pt120" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg120"><span class="f2">[120]</span></a> enlightened;<br />

					walking according to the precepts,<br />
					perpetually conformest to that <a id="pg114"><span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span></a> doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By these words, Cunda,<br />
					teacher<br />
					and doctrine<br />
					and disciple<br />
					are all blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he who should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Verily his reverence<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					mastering the system<br />
					will carry it to a successful end!' -</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus commending<br />
					and he who is commended<br />
					and he who, thus commended,<br />
					redoubles the energy he puts forth, -<br />
					all they generate much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because their doctrine and discipline<br />
					have been badly set forth,<br />
					badly imparted,<br />
					ineffectual for guidance,<br />
					not conducive to peace,<br />
					not imparted by one supremely enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. But consider, Cunda,<br />
					where the teacher is supremely enlightened,<br />
					and the doctrine well set forth,<br />
					well imparted,<br />
					effectual for guidance,<br />
					conducive to peace,<br />
					imparted by one supremely enlightened,<br />
					but where the disciple in that norm<br />
					has not mastered the lesser corollaries<br />
					following on the larger doctrine,<br />
					nor learnt to practise correct conduct,<br />
					nor walks according to the precepts,<br />
					but perpetually evades that doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him one might say: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, thou hast not succeeded,<br />
					thou hast missed thy opportunity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thy teacher is supremely enlightened,<br />
					and his doctrine is well set forth,<br />
					well imparted,<br />
					effectual for guidance,<br />
					conducive to peace,<br />

					nor walk according to the precepts,<br />
					but perpetually evade that doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By these words, Cunda,<br />
					teacher and doctrine are commended,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now if one were to say to such a disciple: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, your reverence,<br />

					<p class="f4">he who instigated,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt121" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg121"><span class="f2">[121]</span></a> 7. But consider, Cunda,<br />

					the doctrine well set forth,<br />
					well imparted,<br />

					conducive to peace,<br />
					imparted by one who is supremely enlightened<br />

					<p class="f4">To him one might say:­</p>

					<p class="f4">By these words, Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Cunda, that is so<br />

					<p class="f4">8. But consider, Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> Uddaka the son of Rama,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is what he meant.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a low pagan thing<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt127" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg127"><span class="f2">[127]</span></a> Now were one to wish to use rightly that phrase,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Seeing he seeth not.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But what is it that seeing<br />

					<p class="f4">A religion that is in every way successful,<br />

					<p class="f4">Were he to abstract some feature<br />

					<p class="f4">and thus Seeing he seeth not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence, Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then if you judge that this honourable member<br />

					<p class="f4">19. Again, Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then if you judge that if this honourable member<br />

					<p class="f4">Unapproving,<br />

					<p class="f4">If he reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these phrases, brother,<br />

					<p class="f4">Neither setting him aside,<br />

					<p class="f4">21. So also must ye act,<br />

					ye are thoroughly to explain to him,<br />

					<p class="f4">21. But if, Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Weil said!'</p>

					<p class="f4">ye should approve of<br />

					<p class="f4">And so saying and doing,<br />

					<p class="f4">22. A new doctrine, Cunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">I teach not a doctrine<br />
					for the extirpating of intoxicants<br />
					in the future life only,<br />
					but one for subduing them now<br />
					and also for extirpating them<br />
					in the after-life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Cunda,<br />
					the raiment sanctioned by me <a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> for you,<br />
					let it suffice for the purpose of warding off cold,<br />
					for warding off heat,<br />
					for warding off the touch of gadfly and mosquito,<br />
					of wind<br />
					and sun<br />
					and snakes.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The alms which are sanctioned by me for you,<br />
					let that suffice to sustain the body in life,<br />
					to keep it going,<br />
					to prevent injury,<br />
					to aid you in living the holy life,<br />
					you taking thought that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus shall I overcome the former sensation,<br />
					nor cause new sensation to arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far shall I both be at ease<br />
					and incur no blame.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The lodging which is sanctioned by me for you,<br />
					let that suffice for you<br />
					to ward off cold,<br />
					to ward off heat,<br />
					to ward off the touch of gadfly and mosquito,<br />
					of wind<br />
					and sun<br />
					and snakes,<br />
					just for the purpose of avoiding<br />
					the dangers of the climate<br />
					and of enjoying seclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The provision in drugs<br />
					and other necessaries for sickness<br />
					which is sanctioned by me for you,<br />
					let that suffice you<br />
					so far as it may ward off sensations of illness<br />
					that have arisen<br />
					and preserve your health.</p>

					<p class="f4">23. It may happen, Cunda,<br />
					that wanderers holding other views than ours may say: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those recluses who follow the Sakyan<br />
					are addicted and devoted<br />
					to a life of pleasure.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Teachers alleging this, Cunda,<br />
					should be answered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, brother,<br />
					is it to be addicted and devoted to pleasure?'</p>

					<p class="f4">For there are many<br />
					and manifold modes<br />
					in which one may be<br />
					so addicted and devoted.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four such modes, Cunda,<br />
					which are low and pagan,<br />
					belonging to the average majority,<br />
					un­worthy,<br />
					not associated with good,<br />
					not conducing to unworldliness,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					to peace,<br />
					to higher knowledge,<br />
					to enlightenment,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Firstly, there is the case<br />
					of the fool who takes his pleasure<br />
					and finds gratification<br />
					in slaying living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly, there is the case<br />
					of <a id="pt131" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg131"><span class="f2">[131]</span></a> one who takes his pleasure<br />
					and finds gratification<br />
					in taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirdly, there is the case<br />
					<a id="pg123"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span></a> of one who takes his pleasure<br />
					and finds gratification<br />
					in false statements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fourthly, there is the case<br />
					of one who dwells surrounded by,<br />
					and in the enjoyment of<br />
					the five kinds of sensuous pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Cunda, are the four modes<br />
					of being addicted and devoted<br />
					to pleasure which are low and pagan,<br />
					belonging to the average majority,<br />
					unworthy,<br />
					disconnected with good,<br />
					not conducive to unworldliness,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					to peace,<br />
					to insight,<br />
					to enlightenment,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">24. It may happen, Cunda,<br />
					that other teachers may ask:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Are those recluses who follow the Sakyan<br />
					addicted and devoted<br />
					to these four modes?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They should be answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, that is not so!'</p>

					<p class="f4">They would not be speaking rightly;<br />
					they would be misrepresenting you<br />
					by what is not fact,<br />
					by what is not so.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four modes<br />
					of being addicted and devoted to pleasure, Cunda,<br />
					which conduce absolutely to unworldliness,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					to peace,<br />
					to higher knowledge,<br />
					to enlightenment,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Firstly, Cunda, when a brother,<br />
					aloof from sensuous appetites,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters into and abides in the First Jhāna,<br />
					wherein there is initiative and sustained thought<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of zest and ease.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly,<br />
					when suppressing initiative and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna,<br />
					which is self-evoked,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					in that, set free from initial and sustained thought,<br />
					the mind grows calm and sure,<br />
					dwelling on high.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thirdly, when a brother,<br />
					no longer fired with zest,<br />
					abides calmly contemplative,<br />
					while mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he feels in his body<br />
					<a id="pg124"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span></a> that ease where of Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is calmly contemplative and aware,<br />
					he dwelleth at ease,'</p>

					<p class="f4">so does he enter into and abide in the Third Jhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fourthly, by putting aside ease<br />
					and by putting aside malaise,<br />
					by the passing away<br />
					of the joy and the sorrow he used to feel,<br />
					<a id="pt132" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg132"><span class="f2">[132]</span></a> he enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna,<br />
					rapture of utter purity of mindfulness and equanimity,<br />
					wherein neither ease is felt<br />
					nor any ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four modes<br />
					of being addicted and devoted tu pleasure, Cunda,<br />
					conduce to utter unworldliness,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to cessation,<br />
					to peace,<br />
					to insight,<br />
					to enlightenment,<br />
					to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">If then it happen, Cunda,<br />
					that wanderers teaching other doctrines<br />
					should declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Sākyan recluses<br />
					live addicted and devoted to <i>these</i> four modes of pleasure,<br />
					to them ye should answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yea.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Rightly would they be speaking of you,<br />
					nor would they be misrepresenting you<br />
					by what is not fact,<br />
					by what does not exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">25. It may happen, Cunda,<br />
					that Teachers teaching other doctrines than ours<br />
					may declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For those who live addicted and devoted<br />
					to <i>these</i> four modes of pleasure, brother,<br />
					how much fruit,<br />
					how many advantages are to be expected?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Them ye should answer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Four kinds of fruit, brother,<br />
					four advantages<br />
					are to be expected.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Firstly, the case of a brother<br />
					who by the complete destruction of the three fetters<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span><br />
					becomes a Stream-winner,<br />
					saved from disaster hereafter,<br />
					certain to attain Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly, the case of a brother<br />
					who by the complete destruction of three fetters<br />
					has so diminished<br />
					passion and hate and illusion<br />
					that he has become a Once­Returner,<br />
					and returning but once to this world<br />
					will make an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirdly, the case of a brother who,<br />
					by the complete destruction<br />
					of the five last fetters,<br />
					will be reborn in another world,<br />
					thence never to return,<br />
					there to pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fourthly, the case of the brother<br />
					who, by the destruction of the mental intoxicants,<br />
					has come to know and realize for himself,<br />
					even <a id="pg125"><span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span></a> in this life,<br />
					emancipation of intellect<br />
					and emancipation of insight,<br />
					and therein abides.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brother, are the four kinds of fruit,<br />
					the four advantages to be expected<br />
					by those who are addicted and devoted<br />
					to those four modes of pleasure.'</p>

					<p class="f4">26. It may happen, Cunda,<br />
					that wanderers <a id="pt133" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg133"><span class="f2">[133]</span></a> teaching other views than ours<br />
					may declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Sakyan recluses are inconsistent in the doctrines they hold.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To them thus declaring, this might be replied:-</p>

					<p class="f4">'Brother, the Exalted One who knows, who sees,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					supremely enlightened,<br />
					hath taught and made known to his disciples<br />
					doctrines not to be trans­gressed<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as a pillar of stone or iron,<br />
					with base deep planted,<br />
					well fixed,<br />
					unshaking,<br />
					unquivering,<br />
					even so are those doctrines.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brother who is arahant,<br />
					in whom the intoxicants are destroyed,<br />
					who has lived the life,<br />
					who has done his task,<br />
					who has laid low his burden,<br />
					who has attained salvation,<br />
					who has utterly destroyed the fetter of rebirth,<br />
					who is emancipated by the true gnosis,<br />
					he is incapable of perpetrating nine things: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">1. He<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> is incapable<br />
					of deliberately depriving a living creature of life.<br />
					2. He is incapable<br />
					of taking what is not given<br />
					so that it constitutes theft.<br />
					3. He is incapable of sexual impurity.<br />
					4. He is incapable of deliberately telling lies.<br />
					5. He is incapable of laying up treasure<br />
					for indulgence in worldly pleasure<br />
					as he used to do in the life of the house.<br />
					6. He is incapable<br />
					of taking a wrong course through partiality.<br />
					7. He is incapable<br />
					of taking a wrong course through hate.<br />
					8. He is incapable<br />
					of taking a wrong course through stupidity.<br />
					9. He is incapable<br />
					of taking a wrong course through fear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> These nine things<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt134" href="../../pali/dn/dn.29.pali.bd.htm#pg134"><span class="f2">[134]</span></a> 27. It may happen, Cunda,<br />
