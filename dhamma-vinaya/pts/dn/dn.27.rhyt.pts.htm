<meta name="description" content="The T.W. Rhys Davids translation of Dīgha Nikāya, Sutta 27, Aggañña Suttantaɱ. The Buddha lays out the idea that the world is a phenomena which goes through cycles of evolution and devolution. Contrary to the popular notion that the Buddha did not answer questions about the origin of the world, this sutta explains the phenomena in great detail. The sutta arises from a discussion of the origin of the classes and gives an interesting history of Gotama's clan, the Sakkyans." />

					<p class="f4">1. The Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī,<br />
					in the East Park,<br />
					at the mansion of the Mother of Migāra.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja<br />
					were passing their probation<br />
					among the brethren,<br />
					desiring to become bhikkhus.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then at eventide the Exalted One,<br />
					having arisen from his meditations,<br />
					had come down from the house,<br />
					and was walking to and fro in the open air,<br />
					in the shade of the house.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now Vāseṭṭha saw this,<br />
					and on seeing it<br />
					he told Bhāradvāja, adding:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us go, friend Bhāradvāja,<br />
					let us approach the Exalted One,<br />
					for perchance we might have the good fortune<br />
					to hear from the Exalted One<br />
					a talk on matters of doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, friend",<br />
					Bhāradvāja made reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja<br />
					went and approached the Exalted One,<br />
					and having saluted him,<br />
					they walked after him<br />
					as he walked to and fro.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then the Exalted One said to Vāseṭṭha:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt81" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg81"><span class="f2">[81]</span></a> "You, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					being brahmins by birth and family,<br />
					have gone forth from a brahmin family,<br />
					your home,<br />
					<a id="pg78"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span></a> into the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not the brahmins blame and revile you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, verily, lord,<br />
					the brahmins do blame and revile us<br />
					with characteristic abuse,<br />
					copious,<br />
					not at all stinted."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in what words, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					do they so blame you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The brahmins, lord, say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The brahmin class<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is the best.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in what terms, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					do the brahmins blame and censure you<br />
					to this extent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The brahmins, lord, say thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Only a brahmin is of the best social grade;<br />
					other grades are low.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only a brahmin is of a clear complexion;<br />
					other complexions are swarthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only brahmins are of pure breed;<br />
					not they that are not of the brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only brahmins are genuine children of Brahmā,<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					offspring of Brahmā,<br />
					created by Brahmā,<br />
					heirs of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">As for you,<br />
					you have renounced the best rank,<br />
					and have gone over to that low class —<br />
					to shaven recluses,<br />
					to the vulgar rich,<br />
					to them of swarthy skins,<br />
					to the foot-born descendants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a course is not good,<br />
					such a course is not proper,<br />
					even this,<br />
					that you,<br />
					having forsaken that upper class,<br />
					should associate with an inferior class,<br />
					to wit,<br />
					with shaveling friar-folk,<br />
					menials,<br />
					swarthy of skin,<br />
					the offscouring of Our kinsman's heels.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In these terms, lord,<br />
					do the brahmins blame and revile us<br />
					with characteristic abuse,<br />
					copious,<br />
					not at all stinted."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Surely, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins have quite forgotten the past<br />
					(the ancient lore)<br />
					when they say so?</p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary, brahminees,<br />
					the wives of brahmins,<br />
					are known to be fertile,<br />
					are seen to be with child,<br />
					<a id="pt82" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg82"><span class="f2">[82]</span></a> bringing forth<br />
					and nursing children.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet it is these very womb-born brahmins<br />
					who say that only brahmins are genuine children of Brahmā,<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					offspring of Brahmā,<br />
					created by Brahmā,<br />
					heirs of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">By this they make a travesty<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of the nature of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> It is false what they say,<br />
					and great is the demerit<br />
					that they thereby earn.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. There are these four classes, Vāseṭṭha:<br />
					nobles, brahmins, tradesfolk, workpeople.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now here and there<br />
					a noble deprives a living being of life,<br />
					is a thief,<br />
					is unchaste,<br />
					speaks lies,<br />
					slanders,<br />
					uses rough words,<br />
					is a gossip,<br />
					or greedy,<br />
					or malevolent,<br />
					or holds wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus we see that qualities<br />
					which are immoral and considered to be so,<br />
					which are blameworthy and considered to be so,<br />
					which ought not to be sought after<br />
					and are so considered,<br />
					which are unworthy of an Ariyan<br />
					and are so considered,<br />
					qualities sinister<br />
					and of sinister effect,<br />
					discountenanced by the wise,<br />
					are to be found here and there<br />
					in such a noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we may say as much concerning brahmins, tradesfolk and workpeople.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Again, here and there<br />
					a noble abstains from murder,<br />
					theft,<br />
					inchastity,<br />
					lying,<br />
					slandering,<br />
					gossiping,<br />
					greed,<br />
					malevolence<br />
					and false opinions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus we see that qualities<br />
					which are,<br />
					and are considered,<br />
					moral,<br />
					inoffensive,<br />
					unexceptional,<br />
					truly Ariyan,<br />
					benign<br />
					and of benign effect,<br />
					commended by the wise,<br />
					are to be found here and there<br />
					in a noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we may say as much<br />
					concerning each of the others —<br />
					brahmins, tradesfolk <a id="pt83" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg83"><span class="f2">[83]</span></a> and workpeople.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Now seeing, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that both bad and good qualities,<br />
					blamed and praised respectively by the wise,<br />
					are thus distributed<br />
					among each of the four classes,<br />
					the wise do not admit those claims<br />
					which the brahmins put forward.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					whoever among all these four classes<br />
					becomes a bhikkhu,<br />
					an Arahant,<br />
					one who has destroyed the deadly taints,<br />
					who has lived the life,<br />
					has done that which was to be done,<br />
					has laid down the burden,<br />
					has attained his own salvation,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					has destroyed the fetter of rebirth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and has <a id="pg80"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></a> become free<br />
					because he has perfected knowledge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					he is declared chief among them,<br />
					and that in virtue of a norm (a standard),<br />
					and not irrespective of a norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a norm, Vāseṭṭha, is</p>

						<p class="f4 in2">the best among this folk<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
						both in this life and in the next.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">8. The following, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is an illustration for understanding<br />
					how a norm is the best among this folk<br />
					both in this life<br />
					and in the next.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi of Kosala is aware<br />
					that the Samaṇa Gotama has gone forth<br />
					from the adjacent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> clan of the Sākiyas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Sākiyas are become<br />
					the vassals of King Pasenadi.</p>

					<p class="f4">They render to him<br />
					homage and respectful salutation,<br />
					they rise and do him obeisance,<br />
					and treat him with ceremony.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, just as the Sakiyans treat King Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					<a id="pt84" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><span class="f2">[84]</span></a> so does the king treat the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">For he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is not the Samaṇa Gotama well born?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I am not well born.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Samaṇa Gotama is strong,<br />
					I am weak.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is attractive,<br />
					I am not comely.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Samaṇa Gotama has great influence,<br />
					I have but little influence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is because the king honours a norm,<br />
					reveres a norm,<br />
					regards a norm,<br />
					does homage <a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></a> to a norm,<br />
					holds sacred a norm,<br />
					that he renders homage<br />
					and respectful salutation to the Tathāgata,<br />
					rising and doing him obeisance,<br />
					and treating him with ceremony.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">By this illustration<br />
					may it be understood how a norm is:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">the best among this folk<br />
							both in this life and in the next.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. You, Vāseṭṭha, who,<br />
					differing all of you in birth,<br />
					in name,<br />
					in clan<br />
					and family,<br />
					have gone forth from home<br />
					into the homeless life,<br />
					may be asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who are ye?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then do ye reply:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We be Samaṇas<br />
					who follow him of the sons of the Sākiyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					whose faith in the Tathāgata is settled,<br />
					rooted,<br />
					established<br />
					and firm,<br />
					a faith not to be dragged down<br />
					by recluse or brahmin,<br />
					by deva<br />
					or Mara<br />
					or Brahmā<br />
					or anyone in the world,<br />
					well may he say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a veritable son of the Exalted One,<br />
					born from his mouth,<br />
					born of the Norm,<br />
					created by the Norm,<br />
					heir of the Norm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					these are names tantamount to Tathāgata:<br />
					'Belonging to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> the Norm,'<br />
					and again,<br />
					'belonging to the highest',<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and again,<br />
					'one with the Norm',<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and again,<br />
					'one with the Highest'.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. There comes a time,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					when,<br />
					sooner or later,<br />
					after the lapse of a long, long period,<br />
					this world <a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> passes away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when this happens,<br />
					beings have mostly been reborn<br />
					in the World of Radiance;<br />
					and there they dwell,<br />
					made of mind,<br />
					feeding on rapture,<br />
					self-luminous,<br />
					traversing the air,<br />
					continuing in glory;<br />
					and thus they remain<br />
					for a long, long period of time.</p>

					<p class="f4">There comes also a time, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					when sooner or later<br />
					this world begins to re-evolve.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happens,<br />
					beings who had deceased from the World of Radiance,<br />
					usually <a id="pt85" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg85"><span class="f2">[85]</span></a> come to life as humans.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And they become made of mind,<br />
					feeding on rapture,<br />
					self-luminous,<br />
					traversing the air,<br />
					continuing in glory,<br />
					and remain thus<br />
					for a long, long period of time.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Now at that time,<br />
					all had become one world of water,<br />
					dark,<br />
					and of darkness that maketh blind.</p>

					<p class="f4">No moon nor sun appeared,<br />
					no stars were seen,<br />
					nor constellations,<br />
					neither was night manifest nor day,<br />
					neither months nor half-months,<br />
					neither years nor seasons,<br />
					neither female nor male.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beings were reckoned just as beings only.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to those beings, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					sooner or later<br />
					after a long time,<br />
					earth with its savour was spread out in the waters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a scum forms on the surface<br />
					of boiled milky rice that is cooling,<br />
					so did the earth appear.</p>

					<p class="f4">It became endowed with colour,<br />
					with odour,<br />
					and with taste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as well-made ghee<br />
					or pure butter,<br />
					so was its colour;<br />
					even as the flawless honey of the bee,<br />
					so sweet was it.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. Then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					some being of greedy disposition,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lo now! what will this be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">and tasted the savoury earth with his finger.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus, tasting,<br />
					became suffused with the savour,<br />
					and craving entered into him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And other beings,<br />
					following his example,<br />
					tasted the savoury earth with their finger.</p>

					<p class="f4">They thus, tasting,<br />
					became suffused with the savour,<br />
					a craving entered into them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those beings began to feast<br />
					on the savoury earth,<br />
					breaking off lumps of it<br />
					with their hands.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg83"><span class="f2 g"><b>[83]</b></span></a> from <a id="pt86" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg86"><span class="f2">[86]</span></a> the doing thereof<br />
					the self-luminance of those beings<br />
					faded away.</p>

					<p class="f4">As their self-luminance faded away,<br />
					the moon and the sun became manifest.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon star-shapes<br />
					and constellations became manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon night and day became manifest,<br />
					months too and half-months,<br />
					the seasons and the years.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					did the world evolve again.</p>

					<p class="f4">13. Now those beings, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					feasting on the savoury earth,<br />
					feeding on it,<br />
					nourished by it,<br />
					continued thus for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in measure as they thus fed,<br />
					did their bodies become solid,<br />
					and did variety in their comeliness become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some beings were well favoured,<br />
					some were ill favoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">And herein<br />
					they that were well favoured<br />
					despised them that were ill favoured,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are more comely than they;<br />
					they are worse favoured than we.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And while they<br />
					through pride in their beauty<br />
					thus became vain and conceited,<br />
					the savoury earth disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the disappearance of the savoury earth,<br />
					they gathered themselves together<br />
					and bewailed it:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas for the savour!<br />
					alas for the savour!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so now<br />
					when men having gotten a good savour say;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ah, the savour of it!<br />
					ah, the savour of it!'</p>

					<p class="f4">they do but follow<br />
					an ancient primordial saying,<br />
					not recognizing the significance thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">14. Then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					when the savoury earth <a id="pt87" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg87"><span class="f2">[87]</span></a> had vanished for those beings,<br />
					outgrowths appeared in the soil.</p>

					<p class="f4">The manner of the rising up thereof<br />
					was as the springing up of the mushroom,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span><br />
					it had colour,<br />
					odour and taste;<br />
					even as well-formed ghee<br />
					or fine butter<br />
					so was the colour thereof,<br />
					and even as flawless honeycomb<br />
					so was the sweetness thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those beings began to feast<br />
					on these outgrowths of the soil.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they,<br />
					feasting on them,<br />
					finding food and nourishment in them,<br />
					continued for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg84"><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></a> in measure as they thus fed<br />
					and were thus nourished,<br />
					so did their bodies grow ever more solid,<br />
					and the difference in their comeliness<br />
					more manifest,<br />
					some becoming well favoured,<br />
					some ill favoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they that were well favoured<br />
					despised them that were ill favoured,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are more comely than they;<br />
					they are worse favoured than we.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And while they,<br />
					through pride in their beauty,<br />
					thus became vain and conceited,<br />
					these outgrowths of the soil disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon creeping plants<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> appeared,<br />
					and the manner of the growth thereof<br />
					was as that of the bamboo,<br />
					and they had colour, odour and taste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as well-made ghee<br />
					or fine butter<br />
					so was the colour thereof;<br />
					even as flawless honeycomb<br />
					so was the sweetness thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					those beings began to feast on the creepers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they, feasting on them,<br />
					feeding on them,<br />
					nourished by them,<br />
					continued so for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in measure as they thus fed<br />
					and were nourished<br />
					did their bodies wax more solid,<br />

					<a id="pt88" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg88"><span class="f2">[88]</span></a><br />
					some becoming well favoured,<br />
					some ill favoured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they that were well favoured<br />

					<p class="f4">And while those,<br />
					through pride in their beauty,<br />
					became vain and conceited,<br />
					the creepers disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the disappearance thereof<br />
					they gathered themselves together<br />
					and bewailed, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Verily it was ours, the creeper!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it has vanished away!</p>

					<p class="f4">Alas and O me! we have lost!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so now when men,<br />

					<p class="f4">they do but follow<br />

					<p class="f4">16. Then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />

					<p class="f4 in2">No powder had it<br />

					<p class="f4">[Pure,] fragrant and clean grained.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> Where of an evening<br />

					<p class="f4">Where in the morning<br />
					they gathered and carried away for breakfast,<br />
					there in the evening it stood ripe<br />
					and grown again.</p>

					<p class="f4">No break was to be seen<br />
					[where the husks had been broken off].</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those beings<br />
					feasting on this rice in the clearings,<br />
					feeding on it,<br />
					nourished by it,<br />
					so continued for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in measure as they,<br />
					thus feeding,<br />
					went on existing,<br />
					so did the bodies of those beings<br />
					become even more solid,<br />
					and the divergence in their comeliness<br />
					more pronounced.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the female<br />
					appeared the distinctive features<br />

					in the male<br />
					those of the male.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then truly did woman contemplate man too closely,<br />
					and man, woman.</p>

					<p class="f4">In them contemplating over much<br />
					the one the other,<br />
					passion arose<br />
					and burning entered their body.</p>

					<p class="f4">They in consequence thereof<br />
					followed their lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And beings seeing them so doing<br />
					threw, some, sand,<br />
					some, ashes, <a id="pt89" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg89"><span class="f2">[89]</span></a> some, cowdung,<br />
					crying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Perish, foul one! perish, foul one!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so now when men,<br />

					or ashes,<br />
					or cowdung,<br />
					they do but follow<br />
					an ancient enduring primordial form,<br />
					not recognizing the significance thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. That which was reckoned immoral<br />
					at that time, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is now reckoned to be moral.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those beings<br />
					who at that time followed their lusts,<br />
					were not allowed to enter village or town<br />
					either for a whole month<br />
					or even for two months.</p>

					<p class="f4">And inasmuch as those beings<br />
					at that time quickly incurred blame for immorality,<br />
					they set to work to make huts,<br />
					to conceal just that immorality.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg86"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></a> Then Vāseṭṭha,<br />

					<p class="f4">What if I were to fetch enough rice<br />
					for supper and breakfast together?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he gathered at one journey<br />
					enough rice for the two meals together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then some being came to him and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good being,<br />
					let us go rice-gathering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That's not wanted, good being,<br />
					I have fetched rice<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the former followed his example<br />
					and fetched rice for two days at once,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So much, they say,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then some other being<br />

					<p class="f4">Now from the time, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that those beings began to feed on hoarded rice,<br />
					powder enveloped the clean grain,<br />
					and husk enveloped the grain,<br />
					and the reaped or cut stems<br />
					did not grow again;<br />
					a break became manifest<br />
					[where the reaper had cut];<br />
					the rice stubble stood in clumps.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. Then those beings, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					gathered themselves<br />
					and bewailed this, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Evil customs, sirs,<br />
					have appeared among men.</p>

					<p class="f4">For in the past,<br />
					we were made of mind,<br />
					we fed on rapture,<br />
					self-luminous,<br />
					we traversed the air in abiding loveliness;<br />
					long long the period we so remained.</p>

					<p class="f4">For us sooner or later,<br />
					after a long long while<br />
					the savoury earth had arisen over the waters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Colour it had,<br />
					and odour and taste.</p>

					<p class="f4">We set to work<br />
					to make the earth into lumps,<br />
					and feast on it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As we did so<br />
					our self-luminance vanished away.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it was gone,<br />
					moon and sun became manifest,<br />
					<a id="pt91" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg91"><span class="f2">[91]</span></a> star-shapes and constellations,<br />
					night and day,<br />
					the months and half-months,<br />
					the seasons and the years.</p>

					<p class="f4">We enjoying the savoury earth,<br />
					feeding on it,<br />
					nourished by it,<br />
					continued so for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since evil and immoral customs<br />
					became rife among us,<br />
					<a id="pg87"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></a> the savoury earth disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it had ceased<br />
					outgrowths of the soil became manifest,<br />
					clothed with colour,<br />
					odour and taste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Them we began to enjoy;<br />
					and fed and nourished thereby,<br />
					we continued so for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when evil and immoral customs<br />
					arose among us,<br />
					these outgrowths disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had vanished,<br />
					creepers appeared<br />
					clothed with colour,<br />
					odour and taste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Them we turned to enjoy;<br />
					and fed and nourished thereby<br />
					we continued so for a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">But since evil and immoral customs<br />
					became prevalent among us,<br />
					the creepers also disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had ceased<br />
					rice appeared,<br />
					ripening in open spaces,<br />
					without powder,<br />
					without husk,<br />
					pure, fragrant and clean grained.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where we plucked and took away<br />
					for the evening meal every evening,<br />
					there next morning it had grown ripe again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where we plucked and took away<br />
					for the morning meal,<br />
					there in the evening it had grown ripe again.</p>

					<p class="f4">There was no break visible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Enjoying this rice,<br />
					feeding on it,<br />
					nourished by it,<br />
					we have so continued a long long while.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from evil and immoral customs<br />
					becoming manifest among us,<br />
					powder has enveloped the clean grain,<br />
					husk too has enveloped the clean grain,<br />
					and where we have reaped is no re-growth;<br />
					a break has come,<br />
					and the rice-stubble stands in <a id="pt92" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg92"><span class="f2">[92]</span></a> clumps.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, let us divide off the rice fields<br />
					and set boundaries thereto!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they divided off the rice<br />
					and set up boundaries round it.</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now some being, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					of greedy disposition,<br />
					watching over his own plot,<br />
					stole another plot<br />
					and made use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">They took him<br />
					and holding him fast, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truly, good being,<br />
					thou hast wrought evil<br />
					in that, while watching thine own plot,<br />
					thou hast stolen another plot<br />
					and made use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">See, good being,<br />
					that thou do not such a thing again!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ay, sirs, he replied.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time he did so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet a third.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again they took him<br />
					and admonished him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some smote him with the hand,<br />
					some with clods,<br />
					some with sticks.</p>

					<p class="f4">With such a beginning, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					did stealing appear,<br />
					and censure<br />
					and lying<br />
					and punishment became known.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> 20. Now those beings, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					gathered themselves together,<br />
					and bewailed these things, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'From our evil deeds, sirs,<br />
					becoming manifest,<br />
					inasmuch as stealing,<br />
					censure,<br />
					lying,<br />
					punishment have become known,<br />
					what if we were to select a certain being,<br />
					who should be wrathful<br />
					when indignation is right,<br />
					who should censure<br />
					that which should rightly be censured<br />
					and should banish<br />
					him who deserves to be banished?</p>

					<p class="f4">But we will give him in return<br />
					a proportion of the rice.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt93" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg93"><span class="f2">[93]</span></a> Then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					those beings went to the being among them<br />
					who was the handsomest,<br />
					the best favoured,<br />
					the most attractive,<br />
					the most capable<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come now, good being,<br />
					be indignant<br />
					at that whereat one should rightly be indignant,<br />
					censure<br />
					that which should rightly be censured,<br />
					banish<br />
					him who deserves to be banished.</p>

					<p class="f4">And we will contribute to thee<br />
					a proportion of our rice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he consented,<br />
					and did so,<br />
					and they gave him a proportion of their rice.</p>

					<p class="f4">21. 'Chosen by the whole people', Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is what is meant by <i>Mahā Sammata;</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span><br />
					so <i>'Mahā Sammata'</i> (the Great Elect)<br />
					was the first standing phrase to arise<br />
					[for such an one].<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord of the Fields'<br />
					is what is meant by <i>Khattiya;</i><br />
					so <i>'Khattiya'</i> (Noble)<br />
					was the next expression to arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">'He charms the others by the Norm' —<br />
					by what ought (to charm) —<br />
					is what is meant by <i>Raja;</i><br />
					so this was the third standing phrase to arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					was the origin of this social circle of the Nobles,<br />
					according to the ancient primordial phrases<br />
					[by which they were known].</p>

					<p class="f4">Their origin<br />
					was from among those very beings,<br />
					and no others;<br />
					like unto themselves,<br />
					not unlike;<br />
					and it took <a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> place according to the Norm<br />
					[according to what ought to be, justly,<br />
					not unfittingly.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For, Vāseṭṭha:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The norm's the best among this folk<br />
							both in this life and in the next.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">22. Now it occurred, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					to some of those beings,<br />
					as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Evil deeds, sirs,<br />
					have become manifest among us,<br />
					inasmuch as stealing,<br />
					censure,<br />
					lying,<br />
					punishment can be noticed,<br />
					and banishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us now put away from us<br />
					evil and immoral customs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And they put away from them such customs.</p>

					<p class="f4">'They put away<br />
					<i>(bāhenti)</i> evil, immoral customs,' Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is what is meant by <i>Brahmins,</i><br />
					and thus was it<br />
					that Brahmins became the earliest standing phrase<br />
					[for those who did so].</p>

					<p class="f4">They, making leaf huts in woodland spots,<br />
					meditated therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Extinct for them<br />
					the burning coal,<br />
					vanished the smoke,<br />
					fallen<br />
					lies pestle and mortar;<br />
					gathering of an evening<br />
					for the evening meal,<br />
					of a morning<br />
					for the morning meal,<br />
					they go down into village<br />
					and town<br />
					and royal city,<br />
					seeking food.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they have gotten food,<br />
					back again in their leaf huts<br />
					they meditate.</p>

					<p class="f4">When men saw this, they said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> 'These good beings,<br />
					having made unto themselves<br />
					leaf-huts in the forest region,<br />
					meditate therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">For them burning coal is extinct,<br />
					smoke is known no more,<br />
					pestle and mortar<br />
					have fallen from their hands;<br />
					they gather of an evening<br />
					for the evening meal,<br />
					of a morning<br />
					for the morning meal,<br />
					and go down into village<br />
					and town<br />
					and royal city<br />
					seeking food.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they have gotten food,<br />
					back again in their leaf-huts<br />
					they meditate.</p>

					<p class="f4">'They meditate' <i>(jhāyanti),</i> Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is what is meant by<br />
					'the brooding one' <i>(jhāyakā).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was it that this<br />
					was the second phrase that arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">23. Now certain of those beings, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					being incapable of enduring<br />
					this meditation in forest leaf-huts,<br />
					went down and settled<br />
					on the outskirts of villages and towns,<br />
					making books.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When men saw this, they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These good beings,<br />
					being incapable of enduring meditation in forest leaf-huts,<br />
					have gone down<br />
					and settled on the outskirts of villages and towns,<br />
					and there they make books.</p>

					<p class="f4">But they cannot meditate.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, 'These meditate not', Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					is what is meant by <i>'Ajjhāyak'</i>a<br />
					(repeaters, viz., of the Vedas).</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this third phrase for such people<br />
					came into use.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time<br />
					they were looked upon as the lowest;<br />
					now they are thought the best.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such then, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					according to the ancient,<br />
					yea, primordial,<br />
					expressions by which they were known,<br />
					was the origin of this social circle of the Brahmins.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt95" href="../../pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg95"><span class="f2">[95]</span></a> Their origin<br />
					was from just those beings<br />
					[above referred to];<br />
					beings like unto themselves,<br />
					not unlike;<br />
					[and it took place]<br />
					according to the Norm<br />
					[according to what ought to be, justly<br />
					not unfittingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Vāseṭṭha:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The Norm's the best among this folk<br />
							both in this life and in the next.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> 24. Now, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					there were some others of those beings who,<br />
					adopting the married state,<br />
					set on foot various trades.</p>

					<p class="f4">That they, adopting the married state,<br />
					set on foot various <i>[vissa]</i> trades<br />
					is, Vāseṭṭha, the meaning of <i>'vessā'</i><br />
					(tradesfolk).</p>

					<p class="f4">So this word came into use<br />
					as a standing expression for such people.</p>

					<p class="f4">The origin, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					of the social group called the <i>Vessas</i><br />
					was in accordance with this ancient,<br />
					yea, primordial designation.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was from just those beings<br />
					[above described]<br />
					beings like unto themselves,<br />
					not unlike.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it took place<br />
					in accordance with the Norm <br />
					according to what ought to be, justly<br />

					<p class="f4">For, Vāseṭṭha:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The norm's the best among this folk<br />
							both in this life and in the next.</p>

					<p class="f4">25. Now, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					those of these beings that remained over<br />
					took to hunting.</p>

					<p class="f4">But 'those that live on hunting,<br />
					and suchlike trifling pursuits',<br />
					is what is meant by <i>'Sudda'</i><br />
					(the lowest grade of folk).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus then, according to the ancient,<br />
					yea, primordial expression,<br />
					is the origin of this social group called <i>Suddas.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Their origin was from just those beings<br />
					(above described),<br />
					beings like unto themselves,<br />

					not unfittingly,<br />
					namely, from those who were not different from other beings,<br />

					not unlike them,<br />
					by a norm<br />

					<p class="f4">For, Vāseṭṭha:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> 26. Now there came a time, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					when some <i>Khattiya,</i><br />
					misprizing his own norm,<br />
					went forth from home into the homeless life,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will become a recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some <i>Brahmin</i><br />

					<p class="f4">Some <i>Sudda,</i><br />
					misprizing his own norm,<br />

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will become a recluse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Out of these four groups or circles, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					the company of the recluses came into being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Their origin was from just these beings like unto themselves,<br />
					not different.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it took place according to a norm<br />
					[a fitness, justly],<br />

					<p class="f4">For, Vāseṭṭha,</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The norm's the best among this folk<br />

					<p class="f4">27. Now a khattiya, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					who has led a bad life,<br />
					in deed, word and thought,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> On the subject of this Suttanta see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#pgxxv">Introduction to I,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm#pg105">105 f.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/visakha_migaramata.htm"><i>Visākhā.</i></a> Buddhaghosa gives an account of her and her mansion, built for the Order, which is much shorter, but in agreement with the full narrative contained in the <i>Dhammapada Comy.</i> I, 334 ff. The vast majority of houses were in the oldest Buddhist period in North India what we should now call huts. We hear only of a very few such <i>pāsādas</i> or mansions. Tradition describes this one as a bungalow with one upper storey. In the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p17">Mahā-sudassana (above, Vol. II</a>) we have a description of the most glorious palace the early Buddhists could think of. It is a modest affair. The archceological evidence is discussed in <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.005.town.htm#pg63"><i>Buddhist India,</i> pp. 63-77, Figs. 3-11.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The Comy. identifies these two with the two brahmins of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p13"><i>Tevijja Suttanta</i> (above, I, 301)</a> and the Vāseṭṭha Suttas of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p98"><i>Majjhima,</i> Sutta 98,</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp35"><i>Sutta-Nipāta,</i> Sutta 35.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Vaṇṇa.</i> Literally, colour, which never means caste. See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm#pg99">above, I, 99 ff.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Abbhācikkhanti Brahmānaɱ.</i> The verb often means to misrepresent another's opinions (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.055.pali.bd.htm"><i>Majjh.</i> I, 368;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p8"><i>Dīgha</i> I, 161;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p49"><i>Ang.</i> III, 57;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vin.</i></a> IV, 135). The root <i>cikh</i> is to take note of, observe.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Khattiyā, brahmaṇā, vessā, suddā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa permits an alternative meaning of <i>sadattho</i> either as <i>sundaro,</i> or <i>sako attho:</i> excellent or own advantage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> = <i>taṇhā</i> (Comy.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Sammā hetunā kāraṇena jānitvā vimutto</i> (Comy.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Imasmiṅ 1oke ti attho</i>; the world's inhabitants. The verse from which this is quoted is given in full at the end of this Dialogue, § 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> We take dhamma here (the word rendered norm, standard) in the sense attributed to it by Mrs. Rhys Davids in her discussion of this passage in <i>Buddhism</i> (Home University Library) pp. 235 ff. The remarkable utterance we find in this passage is only one of many in which the Normalism (as distinct from Animism) of the Buddhist position is emphasized. There is nothing metempirical about it. It is the cosmic law which is the Norm or standard, by which alone superiority or inferiority is to be judged.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> We read <i>anantarā,</i> not <i>anuttaro.</i> See note in text. The Comy. has the following: <i>anantarā ti antara-virahitā (or vihitā), attano kulena sadisā ti attho.</i> It agrees better with the context, which does not call for such a word as <i>anuttaro.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> See <i>M.</i> II, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p88">112,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.089.pali.bd.htm#pg120">120,</a> where the homage paid is of the humblest.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammakāyo.</i> Lit. having a Norm-body. Buddhaghosa says: why is the Tathāgato said to have a Norm-body? Because having devised the Three-Piṭaka-Buddha-word by his mind he conducts it forth by his speech. Therefore his body from having Normness <i>(dhammatā)</i> is considered as the Norm, and is so called. And just because of this Norm-body-ness, he has an excellent body, for Norm is called <i>brahma</i> in the sense of best, supreme, excellent ... thus far the Exalted One having spoken in terms of values, goes on to speak in those terms by another method, beginning, There comes a time, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Brahma — i.e.</i> says the Comy. <i>brahma</i> in the sense of best <i>(seṭṭhaṭṭhena).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Lit. Norm-become — <i>i.e.</i> says the Comy. of-the-nature-of-the-Norm <i>(Dhamma-sabhāvo).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> This paragraph occurs in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#p39">Vol. I, p. 30,</a> verbatim, as to the former half, fuller as to the latter half.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Lit. come to 'hereness' which the Comy. explains as humanity. The description of them is scarcely human, but their birth, says Buddhaghosa, is <i>opapātika.</i> See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#pg201">I, 201, <i>n.</i> 3.</a> Cf. Ambapāli's birth, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thig/idx_thig.htm#p66"><i>Psalms of the Sisters,</i> 120.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Greedy in his previous birth, remarks the Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>Ahicchattako.</i> Literally snake-hood, but that this was used idiomatically for a kind of mushroom shaped like a snake's hood appears from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_182"><i>Jātaka</i> II, 95</a> and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#fn2"><i>Udāna,</i> p. 81, note.</a> The Sanskrit lexicons give the names of several other plants called snake-hood, and the plant here meant is not certain. We do not know whether mushrooms are found at all in North India.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Badalatā.</i> A beautiful creeper of sweet taste, says Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>Akaṭṭha-pāko.</i> According to the Comy. springing up in land free from jungle.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> R.O. Franke is probably right in supposing that we have here a fragment of an old ballad, and should therefore add 'pure' <i>suddho.</i> See below, § 18. There are quite a number of such apparent fragments of verse in the prose texts. See the notes of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya Texts</i></a> I, 149, and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/dn.16.rhyt.bs_1.5.htm#pg107"><i>Buddhist Suttas</i> <i>(S.B.E.),</i> p. 107.</a> The apparent verse is here (as often) very poor verse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Those who had been women in a previous birth, explains Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>Mahā Sammata.</i> Name of a famous king in the beginning of time, who was the first king of the Solar race, and the legendary ancestor of many lines of kings (among others of the kings of the Sākiya clan).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>Akkhara,</i> the enduring, came later on to mean letter. At the end of § 16 we have rendered it form (of speech). Cf. § 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>No adhammena.</i> The argument is that there was no tribal difference, no difference of blood, between them and all the rest. They were selected, set apart, for the performance of certain duties, and they were so selected, not arbitrarily, but according to their real fitness for the post. Each of them fulfilled the Ideal of a noble, which included, not only righteousness, but also other things. As will be seen, there was also an ideal, a standard, a Norm, for each of the other groups.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> The etymologies in this paragraph are purely fanciful; and as a matter of fact the historical order in which the three words are said to qave arisen is exactly reversed. <i>Rāja</i> is the oldest of the three — belonging, as it does, to the oldest Aryan stock of words, and being found in Latin and Welsh. <i>Khattiya</i> is the next, and <i>Mahā Sammata.</i> is the youngest of all. But it would show a strange ignorance of history to complain of this. Such plays upon words are common to all ancient literatures. Scientific etymology is a growth of yesterday. The author or authors of this passage (and of all similar ones) were thinking, of course, not of etymology, but of what they regarded as matter of the highest import.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>Ganthe karontā; tayo Vede abhisankharontā c'eva vācentā ca,</i> says the Comy. — compiling the three Vedas and teaching others to repeat them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>Brāhmaṇa-maṇdalassāti Brāhmaṇa-gaṇassa,</i> says Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Both the readings here and the logic of the word-play are doubtful. If the readings are right we have — instead of the usual half pun, half riddle — a mere jingle of rhymes, <i>ludda, khudda, sudda,</i> hunter, mean fellow, low grade. Our modern nobles would lift their eyebrows at so amazing a mixture of epithets, and it would be quite in the spirit of these Suttantas if that touch of irony were really the point of the rhyme. It would be quite as apposite then in India as here in Europe when Carlyle in his <i>Sartor Resartus</i> gave us his vivid sketch of the noble sportsman.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Cf. II, 51.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Lit. a double-doer, <i>dvaya-kāarī.</i> Buddhaghosa's elaboration of this destiny in outline is of interest: There is no opportunity where both results may be incurred at the same moment. But one who has wrought much bad and slight good may be reborn as a <i>Khattiya</i> or <i>Brahmin,</i> because of that good, yet be one-eyed or a hunchback or a cripple, or he may be worthy of a kingdom, yet be unable to come into his own. In another case, when he is dying, his good and bad karma attend him like two strong wrestlers, and the stronger bad karma prevailing, he is reborn as an animal, but, the good karma persisting, he becomes a state-elephant, or state-horse, or state-buffalo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> These seven, in the ancient commentary, embedded in the text of the <i>Vibhanga</i> are explicitly limited to the seven <i>Bojjhangas</i> (p. 249; cf. Mrs. Rhys Davids's Preface, xiv; also <i>A.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/05_fives/an05.056.pali.bd.htm#pg70">III, 70,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p57">71;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/09_nines/an09.001.pali.bd.htm">IV. 351</a>). In the present Comy. Buddhaghosa defines them as the thirty-seven, divided, as Four Satipaṭṭhānas, etc., into seven. But see below, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.28.rhyt.pts.htm#pg96">p. 96,</a> § 3, where the thirty-seven would surely have been called <i>bodhipakkhiyā dhammā,</i> instead of just <i>kusa1ā,</i> had the thirty-seven been so entitled, when the <i>Dialogues</i> were compiled.</p>
