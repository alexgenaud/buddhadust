					When a brother is contemplating ill will, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from ill will. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of ill will, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the second deliverance.<br />
					When a brother is contemplating cruelty, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from cruelty. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of cruelty, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the third deliverance.<br />
					When a brother is contemplating external objects, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from external objects. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of external objects, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the fourth deliverance.<br />
					When a brother is contemplating individuality, his heart does not leap forward to that, nor rest complacent in that, does not choose that. But when he is contemplating renunciation of that, his heart leaps forward, rests complacent in it, chooses it. This frame of mind he gets well in hand, well developed, well lifted up, well freed and detached from individuality. And those intoxicants, whose miseries, those fevers which arise in consequence of individuality, from all these he is freed, nor does he feel that sort of feeling. This is pronounced to be the fifth deliverance.</p>

					Herein, friends, when the Master, or a reverend fellow-disciple teaches the Norm to a brother, according as the teaching is given, the listener comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> This is the first occasion.<br />
					In the next place, a brother, while himself is teaching others the Norm in detail, as he has learnt and got it by memory, comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the second occasion.<br />
					In the third place, a brother, when he is reciting the doctrines of the Norm in detail as he has learnt and got them by memory, comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. <a id="pt242" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg242"><span class="f2">[242]</span></a> This is the third occasion.<br />
					In the fourth place, a brother, when he applies his thought to the Norm as he has <a id="pg230"><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></a> learnt and got it by memory, and sustains protracted meditation on it and contemplates it in mind, comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. This is the fourth occasion.<br />
					Finally, a brother, when he has well grasped some given clue to concentration,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> has well applied his understanding, has well thought it out, has well penetrated it by intuition,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>  comes to know both the matter of the doctrine, and the text of the doctrine. And gladness springs up in him, and in him gladdened zest springs up; his mind enraptured, the faculties become serene; with serenity comes happiness, and of him thus happy the heart is stayed and firm. <a id="pt243" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg243"><span class="f2">[243]</span></a> This is the fifth occasion.</p>

					the notion of impermanence,<br />
					the notion of suffering in impermanence,<br />
					the notion of no-soul in suffering,<br />
					the notion of elimination,<br />
					the notion of passionlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>These fivefold doctrines, friends, have been perfectly set forth by the Exalted One who knows, who sees.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Hereon there should be a chanting by all in concord, not a wrangling, that thus this holy life may persist and be long maintained.</i></p>
