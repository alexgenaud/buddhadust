					<h3 class="ctr">Chapter I</h3>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.23.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. The venerable Kumāra Kassapa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was once walking on tour in Kosala<br />
					together with a great company of bhikkhus,<br />
					to the number of about five hundred,<br />
					and coming to the Kosalese city named Setavyā,<br />
					he there abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the venerable Kumāra Kassapa dwelt to the north of Setavyā,<br />
					in the Siṁsapā-tree Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi<br />
					was residing at Setavyā,<br />
					a spot teeming with life,<br />
					with much grass-land and wood-land,<br />
					with water and corn,<br />
					on a royal domain<br />
					granted him by King Pasenadi of Kosala,<br />
					as a royal gift,<br />
					with power over it as if he were the king.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time<br />
					there came over Pāyāsi<br />
					an evil view of things to this effect:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither is there any other world,<br />
					nor are there beings reborn<br />
					otherwise than from parents,<br />
					nor is there fruit or result of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmins and householders of Setavyā heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say that the wanderer Master Kassapa,<br />
					disciple of the wanderer Gotama,<br />
					walking on tour with a great company of bhikkhus,<br />
					to the number of about five hundred,<br />
					has arrived at Setavyā<br />
					and is staying there to the north of the town,<br />
					in the <a id="pg350"><span class="f2 g"><b>[350]</b></span></a> Siṁsapā-tree Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now regarding that Master Kassapa,<br />
					such is the excellent reputation that has been raised abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wise and expert is he,<br />
					abounding in knowledge and learning,<br />
					eloquent and excellent in discourse,<br />
					venerable too<br />
					and an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">And good is it to interview Arahants like him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmins and householders of Setavyā,<br />
					coming out from the town<br />
					in companies and bands from each district<br />
					so that they could be counted,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					went by the north gate,<br />
					to the Siṁsapā-tree Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Now at that time Pāyāsi, the chieftain,<br />
					had gone apart<br />
					to the upper terrace of his house for siesta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seeing the people thus go by<br />
					he said to his doorkeeper:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why are the people of Setavyā<br />
					going forth like this<br />
					towards the Siṁsapā-tree Grove?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the doorkeeper told him the news.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, good doorkeeper,<br />
					go to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā<br />
					and say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pāyāsi, sirs, bids you wait;<br />
					he will come himself<br />
					to see the Wanderer Master Kassapa."</p>

					<p class="f4">That Boy Kassapa<br />
					will be winning over at the outset<br />
					those foolish and inexpert<br />
					brahmins and householders of Setavyā<br />
					to think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is both another world<br />
					and there are beings<br />
					who are born not of parents,<br />
					and there is fruit,<br />
					and result of deeds<br />
					well done and ill done."</p>

					<p class="f4">But, my good doorkeeper,<br />
					these three things do not exist.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, sir,'<br />
					said the doorkeeper,<br />
					and carried out his master's bidding.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. So Pāyāsi, the chieftain,<br />
					surrounded by the brahmins and householders of Setavyā,<br />
					came to the Siṁsapā-tree Grove,<br />
					and finding the venerable Kassapa,<br />
					exchanged with him the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as to the brahmins and householders of Setavyā,<br />
					some of them bowed before the venerable Kassapa<br />
					and took their seats on one side;<br />
					some of them exchanged with him the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy<br />
					and then took their <a id="pg351"><span class="f2 g"><b>[351]</b></span></a> seats on one side;<br />
					some of them saluted him with joined hands<br />
					and took their seats on one side;<br />
					some of them called out their name and family<br />
					and did likewise,<br />
					some of them took their seats on one side in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And when he was seated<br />
					Pāyāsi spoke thus to the venerable Master Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, Master Kassapa, am of this opinion,<br />
					of these views:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither is there any other world,<br />
					nor are there beings reborn<br />
					otherwise than from parents,<br />
					nor is there fruit or result of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, Prince, have neither seen or heard<br />
					of any one holding such a view,<br />
					such an opinion.</p>

					<p class="f4">How then can you declare,<br />
					as you do, that<br />
					"there neither is another world,<br />
					nor are there beings reborn<br />
					otherwise than from parents,<br />
					nor is there fruit or result of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Prince, I will cross-question you herein,<br />
					and do you reply in what way you may approve.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you,<br />
					yon moon and sun,<br />
					are they in this world<br />
					or in another world,<br />
					are they divine or human?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This moon and sun, Master Kassapa,<br />
					are in another world,<br />
					not in this,<br />
					they are gods,<br />
					not human.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, Prince,<br />
					let this be taken as evidence<br />
					that there is both another world,<br />
					and rebirth as inheritor of the highest heavens,<br />
					and fruit and result of deeds done well or ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. 'Even though Master Kassapa says thus,<br />
					it still appears to me that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Neither is there any other world,<br />
					nor are there beings reborn<br />
					otherwise than from parents,<br />
					nor is there fruit or result of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Have you, Prince, any proof<br />
					to establish that they do not exist?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have, Master Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As how?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here it is, Master Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have had friends,<br />
					companions,<br />
					relatives,<br />
					men of the same blood as myself,<br />
					who have taken life,<br />
					committed thefts,<br />
					or fornication,<br />
					have uttered lying,<br />
					slanderous,<br />
					abusive,<br />
					gossiping speech,<br />
					have been covetous,<br />
					of malign thoughts,<br />
					of evil opinions.</p>

					<p class="f4">They anon have fallen ill<br />
					of mortal suffering and disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had understood<br />
					that they would not recover from that illness,<br />
					I have gone to them and <a id="pg352"><span class="f2 g"><b>[352]</b></span></a> said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"According to the views and opinion held, sirs,<br />
					by certain wanderers and brahmins,<br />
					they who break the precepts of morality,<br />
					when the body breaks up after death,<br />
					are reborn into the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					the Fallen Place,<br />
					the Pit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now you, sirs, have broken those precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">If what those reverent wanderers and brahmins say is true,<br />
					this, sirs, will be your fate.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these things should befall you, sirs,<br />
					come to me and tell me, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is another world,<br />
					there is rebirth not of parents,<br />
					there is fruit and result<br />
					of deeds well-done and ill-done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">You, sirs, are for me trustworthy and reliable,<br />
					and what you say you have seen,<br />
					will be even so,<br />
					just as if I myself had seen it."</p>

					<p class="f4">They have consented to do this, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good,"</p>

					<p class="f4">but they have neither come themselves,<br />
					nor dispatched a messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, Master Kassapa,<br />
					is evidence for me<br />
					that there is neither another world,<br />
					nor rebirth not by human parents,<br />
					nor fruit or result of deeds<br />
					well done and ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'Well then, prince,<br />
					I will yet ask you this,<br />
					and do you answer even as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of men<br />
					who have taken a felon red handed<br />
					and bring him up saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"My lord, this felon was caught in the act;<br />
					inflict what penalty you wish."</p>

					<p class="f4">He replies:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, sirs,<br />
					bind this man securely,<br />
					his arms behind him,<br />
					with a strong cord;<br />
					shave his head;<br />
					lead him around,<br />
					to the sound of a sharp drum,<br />
					from street to street,<br />
					from cross-road to cross-road,<br />
					and out at the southern gate;<br />
					there, south of the town<br />
					in the place of execution,<br />
					cut off his head."</p>

					<p class="f4">They, assenting with</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good,"</p>

					<p class="f4">proceed to carry out these orders,<br />
					and, in the place of execution,<br />
					make him sit down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now would the felon gain permission of this sort from his executioners:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my masters, the executioners,<br />
					wait till I have visited my friends and advisers,<br />
					my kinsmen by blood,<br />
					in this or that village or town,<br />
					and come back"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would the executioners cut off the head of this vain talker?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They would not grant the permission, Master Kassapa;<br />
					they would cut off his head.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg353"><span class="f2 g"><b>[353]</b></span></a> 'But this felon, prince, is human<br />
					and cannot get leave from human executioners.</p>

					<p class="f4">How much less then<br />
					would your friends and relatives,<br />
					after death, in the Pit,<br />
					gain permission from the keepers of the Pit,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my masters, the Pit-keepers,<br />
					wait till we have gone and told the chieftain Pāyāsi,<br />
					that there is both another world<br />
					and rebirth other than of parents,<br />
					and fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well-done and ill?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Be this exposition a proof to you, Prince,<br />
					that these things exist.'</p>

					<p class="f4">8. 'Even though Master Kassapa says thus,<br />
					it still appears to me that not one of these things exists.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Have you, prince,<br />
					any further proof to establish that they do not exist?'</p>

					<p class="f4">I have, Master Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As how?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here it is, Master Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have had friends and companions,<br />
					kinsmen,<br />
					men of the same blood as myself,<br />
					who have abstained from taking life,<br />
					from committing thefts,<br />
					or fornication,<br />
					from lying,<br />
					slandering,<br />
					rude,<br />
					or frivolous speech,<br />
					who have not coveted,<br />
					or had malign thoughts<br />
					or evil opinions.</p>

					<p class="f4">They anon have fallen ill<br />
					of mortal suffering and disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had understood<br />
					that they would not recover from that illness,<br />
					I have gone to them and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"According, sirs, to the views and opinions held by some Wanderers and Brahmins,<br />
					they who keep the precepts of morality,<br />
					when the body breaks up,<br />
					are after death reborn into the bright and happy world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now you, sirs, have kept those precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">If what those reverend samaṇas and brahmins say is true,<br />
					this, sirs, will be your fate.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these things should befall you, sirs,<br />
					when you have been there reborn,<br />
					come to me and let me know<br />
					that there is both another world,<br />
					rebirth other than of parents,<br />
					and fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well-done and ill-done.</p>

					<p class="f4">You, sirs, are for me trustworthy and reliable,<br />
					and what you say you have seen,<br />
					will be even so,<br />
					just as if I myself had seen it."</p>

					<p class="f4">They have consented to do this, saying</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good";</p>

					<p class="f4">but they have not come and let me know,<br />
					nor have <a id="pg354"><span class="f2 g"><b>[354]</b></span></a> they dispatched a messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this again, Master Kassapa,<br />
					is evidence to me<br />
					that there is neither another world,<br />
					nor rebirth other than of parentage,<br />
					nor fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well-done and ill-done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">9. 'Well then, Prince,<br />
					I will make you a simile,<br />
					for by a simile some intelligent persons<br />
					will recognize the meaning of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were plunged head-under<br />
					in a pit of mire.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you were to order men saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well now, masters,<br />
					pull the man out of that pit."</p>

					<p class="f4">They, saying</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good,"</p>

					<p class="f4">were to comply and pull him out.</p>

					<p class="f4">You were then to say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well now, masters,<br />
					brush the mire smearing him<br />
					from off his body with split bamboo."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to obey you.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you were to say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well now, masters,<br />
					shampoo this man's body<br />
					a treble massage<br />
					with yellow shampoo powder."</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you were to say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, masters,<br />
					rub him with oil,<br />
					and bathe him three times<br />
					using fine chunam."</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you were to say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, masters,<br />
					now dress his hair."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you were to say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, masters,<br />
					deck him with a costly garland<br />
					and costly unguent<br />
					and costly garments."</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you were to say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, masters,<br />
					take him up on to the palace<br />
					and amuse him with the pleasures of the five senses."</p>

					<p class="f4">And they were to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, O chieftain?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would this man, well bathed,<br />
					well anointed,<br />
					shaved<br />
					and combed,<br />
					dressed,<br />
					wreathed<br />
					and adorned,<br />
					clad in clean raiment,<br />
					taken to the upper palace,<br />
					and indulging in,<br />
					surrounded by,<br />
					treated to,<br />
					the five pleasures of sense,<br />
					be desirous of being plunged once more<br />
					into that pit of mire?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No indeed, Master Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg355"><span class="f2 g"><b>[355]</b></span></a> 'And why?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Foul, Master Kassapa,<br />
					is a pit of mire,<br />
					foul and counted as such,<br />
					stinking,<br />
					disgusting,<br />
					repulsive,<br />
					and counted as such.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Prince,<br />
					are human beings<br />
					in the eyes of the gods,<br />
					foul<br />
					and counted as such,<br />
					stinking,<br />
					disgusting,<br />
					repulsive,<br />
					and counted as such.</p>

					<p class="f4">The smell of man<br />
					offends the gods<br />
					a hundred leagues away.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then?</p>

					<p class="f4">Shall your friends and companions,<br />
					your kinsmen and connexions<br />
					who, having kept the precepts,<br />
					are reborn into the bright and happy place,<br />
					come and bring you word<br />
					that there is another world,<br />
					that there is rebirth other than by parentage,<br />
					that there is fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well-done and ill-done?</p>

					<p class="f4">Let this exposition, chieftain,<br />
					be evidence to you<br />
					that these things exist.'</p>

					<p class="f4">10.	'Even though Master Kassapa says so,<br />
					it still appears to me<br />
					that not one of these things exists.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Have you, prince,<br />
					any further proof to establish that they do not exist?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have, Master Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As how?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here it is, Master Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have had friends,<br />
					companions,<br />
					kinsmen,<br />
					men of the same blood as myself,<br />
					who kept the precepts,<br />
					abstaining from taking life;<br />
					from taking what was not given,<br />
					from inchastity,<br />
					lying speech<br />
					and strong intoxicating liquors.</p>

					<p class="f4">They anon have fallen mortally ill;<br />
					and I, having told them how some samaṇas and brahmins say that,<br />
					after such a life,<br />
					one would be reborn in the communion<br />
					of the Three-and-Thirty Gods,<br />
					have asked them,<br />
					if they were so reborn,<br />
					to come and let me know that there was another world,<br />
					birth other than of parents,<br />
					and fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well-done and ill-done.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have promised to do so,<br />
					but they have neither come and told me,<br />
					nor sent a messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Master Kassapa,<br />
					is evidence to me that not one of those things exists.'</p>

					<p class="f4">11.	'Well then, Prince,<br />
					I will reply by asking you something,<br />
					and do you answer as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which, humanly speaking,<br />
					is a century,<br />
					this to the <a id="pg356"><span class="f2 g"><b>[356]</b></span></a> Three-and-Thirty Gods<br />
					is one night and day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a night<br />
					thirty nights are the month —<br />
					of such a month<br />
					twelve months are the year —<br />
					of such a year<br />
					the celestial thousand years<br />
					are the life-span of the Three-and-Thirty Gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of whom you now speak<br />
					will have attained rebirth into the communion of these Gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it should occur to them thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let us for two or three days<br />
					indulge ourselves,<br />
					surrounded by and steeped in<br />
					the five pleasures of sense,<br />
					and thereafter let us go and tell the chieftain Pāyāsi<br />
					that there is another world,<br />
					rebirth other than of parents,<br />
					and fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well-done and ill-done"</p>

					<p class="f4">would they then have come to you,<br />
					and told you so?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Certainly not, Master Kassapa;<br />
					for we should have been dead long before.</p>

					<p class="f4">But who lets Master Kassapa know all these things:<br />
					that there are Three-and-Thirty Gods,<br />
					or that the Three-and-Thirty Gods live so many years?</p>

					<p class="f4">We do not believe him when he says these things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That, Prince, is just as if there were a man born blind<br />
					who could not see objects<br />
					as dark or bright,<br />
					as blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red<br />
					or brown;<br />
					who could not see things<br />
					as smooth<br />
					or rough,<br />
					nor the stars,<br />
					nor moon,<br />
					nor sun.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are none of these things,<br />
					nor any one capable of seeing them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I don't know them,<br />
					I don't see them;<br />
					therefore they don't exist."</p>

					<p class="f4">Would one so speaking,<br />
					speak rightly, Prince?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not so, Master Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">The visual objects of which you speak do exist,<br />
					and so does the faculty of seeing them.</p>

					<p class="f4">To say</p>

					<p class="f4">"I don't know them,<br />
					I don't see them;<br />
					therefore they don't exist":</p>

					<p class="f4">that would not be speaking rightly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But even so, methinks, do you, Prince,<br />
					talk like the blind man in my parable<br />
					when you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who lets Master Kassapa know<br />
					that there are Three-and-Thirty Gods,<br />
					or that the Three-and-Thirty Gods live so many years?</p>

					<p class="f4">We do not believe him<br />
					when he says these things."</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Prince, the other world is not,<br />
					as you imagine,<br />

					where noise,<br />
					where sound<br />
					there hardly is,<br />
					they there abiding<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					ardent,<br />

					purify the eye divine;<br />
					they by that purified eye divine,<br />

					<p class="f4">In this way, Prince,<br />

					<p class="f4">Let this be a proof to you<br />

					<p class="f4">'As how?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here it is, Master Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see Wanderers and Brahmins<br />
					moral and of virtuous dispositions,<br />
					fond of life,<br />
					averse from dying,<br />
					fond of happiness,<br />
					shrinking from sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I think, Master Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If these good Wanderers and Brahmins were to know this —</p>

					<p class="f4">'When once we are dead<br />
					we shall be better off' —</p>

					<p class="f4">then these good men would take poison,<br />
					or stab themselves,<br />
					or put an end to themselves by hanging,<br />

					<p class="f4">And it is because they do not know that,<br />
					once dead, they will be better off,<br />
					that they are fond of life,<br />
					averse from dying,<br />
					fond of happiness,<br />
					disinclined for sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Master Kassapa, is for me evidence<br />
					that there is no other world,<br />
					no beings reborn otherwise than of parents,<br />
					no fruit and no result of deeds<br />
					well and ill-done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">13.	'Well then, Prince, I will make you a simile,<br />
					for by way of a simile<br />
					some wise men discern the meaning of what is spoken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Prince,<br />
					there was a brahmin who had two wives.</p>

					<p class="f4">By one he had a son,<br />
					ten or twelve years of age;<br />
					the other was pregnant<br />
					and near her time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin died.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the boy said to his mother's co-wife:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg358"><span class="f2 g"><b>[358]</b></span></a> "Whatever treasure there is, lady,<br />
					or grain,<br />
					or silver,<br />
					or gold,<br />
					all that is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing here for you whatever;<br />
					make over to me, lady,<br />
					the heritage of my father!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahminee made answer to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wait, my lad,<br />
					till my child is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">If'twill be a boy,<br />
					one portion shall be his;<br />
					if a girl, she shall wait on you."</p>

					<p class="f4">'But the boy reiterated his claim<br />
					again and yet again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahminee,<br />
					taking a sword,<br />
					entered an inner room<br />
					and ripped up her belly, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If I can only find out whether 'tis a boy or a girl."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did she destroy both her own life<br />
					and her unborn infant,<br />
					and her wealth also,<br />
					through the foolish and thoughtless way in which,<br />
					seeking a heritage,<br />
					she met with ruin and disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so you, Prince,<br />
					foolish and thoughtless that you are,<br />
					will meet with ruin and disaster<br />
					by seeking without wisdom<br />
					for another world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moral and virtuous Wanderers and Brahmins<br />
					do not force maturity<br />
					on that which is unripe;<br />
					they, being wise,<br />
					wait for that maturity.</p>

					<p class="f4">The virtuous have need of their life.</p>

					<p class="f4">In proportion to the length of time such men abide here,<br />
					is the abundant merit that they produce<br />
					and accomplish<br />
					for the welfare of many,<br />
					for the happiness of many,<br />
					out of compassion for the world,<br />
					for the advantage,<br />
					the welfare,<br />
					the happiness of gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let this then be a proof to you, Prince,<br />
					that there is another world,<br />
					that there is rebirth other than of parentage,<br />
					that there is fruit and result of deeds<br />
					well and ill-done.'</p>

					<p class="f4">14.	'Even though Master Kassapa says so,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Have you further evidence, Prince?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have, Master Kassapa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As how, Prince?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here it is, Master Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of men<br />
					who having taken a felon red-handed<br />
					bring him up, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This felon, my lord, was caught in the act.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inflict on him what penalty you wish."</p>

					<p class="f4">And I should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, my masters,<br />
					throw this man alive into a jar;<br />
					close the mouth of it<br />

					put over that<br />
					a thick cement of moist clay,<br />
					put it on to a furnace<br />

					<p class="f4">They saying</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good"</p>

					<p class="f4">would obey me<br />

					<p class="f4">When we knew that the man was dead,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Perhaps we may see the soul of him coming out!"</p>

					<p class="f4">We don't see the soul of him coming out!</p>

					<p class="f4">This, master Kassapa,<br />

					<p class="f4">How then will you see the soul<br />

					<p class="f4">19.	'Well then, Prince,<br />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Prince,<br />
					a certain trumpeter,<br />
					taking his trumpet of chank-shell,<br />
					travelled to the folk on the border.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he came to a certain village,<br />
					he stood in its midst<br />
					and blew thrice on his trumpet,<br />
					then laying it on the ground<br />
					sat down beside it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Prince, those border folk thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whose is this sound so charming,<br />

					so sweet,<br />
					so constraining,<br />
					so enervating?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Coming together they asked the trumpeter.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, my masters,<br />

					the sound whereof is so charming,<br />
					so lovely,<br />

					<p class="f4">They laid the trumpet on its back<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Speak, master trumpet!<br />
					speak, master trumpet!"</p>

					<p class="f4">No sound did the trumpet make.</p>

					<p class="f4">They laid the trumpet curving downward,<br />
					on this side,<br />
					on that side,<br />
					they stood it upright,<br />
					<a id="pg362"><span class="f2 g"><b>[362]</b></span></a> they stood it topsy turvy,<br />

					on one side,<br />
					on the other,<br />
					on every side,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Speak, master trumpet!<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, the trumpeter thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How silly are these border born men!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why will they seek so senselessly for the trumpet's sound?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And while they looked on,<br />
					he took his trumpet,<br />
					blew thrice upon it and,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Prince, those border born men thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When forsooth there was with that trumpet a man,<br />

					<p class="f4">But when there was with it neither man,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, Prince, when this body has its concomitants of life,<br />

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Prince,<br />
					a fire-worshipping Jaṭila<br />
					was dwelling in a leaf-hut<br />
					in a woodland spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the people of a certain country-side migrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">And their leader,<br />
					after spending one night near the Jaṭila's hermitage,<br />
					went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Jaṭila thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If I were to go to that leader's camp,<br />
					I might perhaps get something useful."</p>

					<p class="f4">And rising up betimes<br />
					he came to the leader's camp,<br />
					and there he saw,<br />
					abandoned and lying on its back<br />
					a little baby.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he saw it he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not fit<br />
					that I should let a human being die<br />
					while I look on.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to carry this baby to my hermitage,<br />
					and foster,<br />
					tend,<br />
					and rear it?</p>

					<p class="f4">"So he carried the baby to his hermitage,<br />
					and fostered,<br />
					tended,<br />
					and reared it.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the boy had attained the age of ten or twelve years,<br />
					it happened that the Jaṭila had something or other to do in the country-side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he said to the boy:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I want to go to the country-side, my lad;<br />
					keep up the fire;<br />
					do not let it go out.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it should go out,<br />
					here is a hatchet,<br />
					here are sticks,<br />
					here is the fire drill,<br />
					so that if you do let the fire out,<br />
					you can rekindle it again."</p>

					<p class="f4">And having thus instructed the boy,<br />
					the Jaṭila went off to the country-side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intent upon his play,<br />
					the boy let the fire out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Father told me,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tend the fire, my lad;<br />
					let it not go out.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it should go out,<br />
					here is a hatchet,<br />
					here are sticks,<br />
					here is the fire drill,<br />
					so that if you do let the fire out,<br />
					you can rekindle it again.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were now to do so?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the boy chopped the fire drill with the hatchet, thinking</p>

					<p class="f4">"Perhaps that's how I shall get fire."</p>

					<p class="f4">No fire got he.</p>

					<p class="f4">He split the fire drill in twain,<br />
					in three,<br />
					four,<br />
					five,<br />
					ten,<br />
					a hundred pieces,<br />
					he made it into piecemeal,<br />
					he then pounded it in a mortar,<br />
					and winnowed it in the wind,<br />
					thinking that so he might <a id="pg364"><span class="f2 g"><b>[364]</b></span></a> perhaps get fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">No fire got he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Jaṭila,<br />
					having accomplished his business,<br />
					came back to his own hermitage<br />
					and said to the boy:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, child, you have let the fire out!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Father, the fire went out<br />
					because I was busy at my game.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought of what you had told me,<br />
					and I set about rekindling it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I chopped the fire drill with the hatchet to get fire,<br />
					but no fire came.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And while the boy looked on,<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, Prince, have you,<br />

					<p class="f4">If I, Master Kassapa, renounce these opinions,<br />

					<p class="f4">23. 'Well then, Prince,<br />
					I will give you a simile;<br />
					for it is by way of a simile that some intelligent men<br />
					discern the meaning of what has been said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, Prince,<br />
					a great caravan of a thousand carts<br />
					was going from the East country<br />
					into the West country.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever it went,<br />
					it consumed swiftly<br />
					straw,<br />
					wood,<br />
					water<br />
					and verdure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in that caravan<br />
					were two caravan leaders,<br />
					each commanding one half of the carts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this occurred to them:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg365"><span class="f2 g"><b>[365]</b></span></a> '"This is a great caravan,<br />
					one of a thousand carts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever we go,<br />
					we consume everything.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if we were to divide this caravan into two,<br />
					five hundred carts in each."</p>

					<p class="f4">'So they divided that caravan into two equal portions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one of the leaders collected large quantities of straw,<br />
					wood<br />
					and water,<br />
					and started [his carts].</p>

					<p class="f4">On the second or third march<br />
					the leader saw a swarthy red-eyed man<br />
					coming from the opposite direction,<br />
					armed with a quiver,<br />
					wearing a lotus wreath,<br />
					his garments and hair wet,<br />
					and driving a chariot drawn by asses,<br />
					its wheel splashed with mud.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he saw this man he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whence come you, Sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"From such and such a district"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Whither go you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"To such and such a district."</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Has there, Sir, been any great fall of rain<br />
					recently in the jungle?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Yes indeed, Sir, there has been a great rain<br />
					in the jungle just in front,<br />
					the roads are well watered,<br />
					there is much grass<br />
					and wood<br />
					and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Throw away the grass<br />
					and wood<br />
					and water,<br />
					Sir, you have already got;<br />
					with light-laden carts<br />
					you will go quite quickly;<br />
					do not tire your teams."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then the leader told his carters<br />
					what the man had said,<br />
					and bade them throw away their provender<br />
					and wood,<br />
					that the caravan might travel more quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">'"So be it, sir,"<br />
					the carters replied,<br />
					and did so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But at their first camp<br />
					they saw no grass<br />
					or wood<br />
					or water,<br />
					nor at the second,<br />
					third,<br />
					fourth,<br />
					fifth,<br />
					sixth<br />
					or seventh camp.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they all met with ruin and disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then that fiend, the yakkha,<br />
					devoured all the men and the cattle in that caravan,<br />
					leaving only the bones behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the second caravan leader<br />
					knew that the other caravan had got well on its way,<br />
					he took in large supplies of grass<br />
					and wood<br />
					and water<br />
					and set out.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he too met a swarthy red-eyed man,<br />
					and exchanged with him the same remarks,<br />
					and was also bidden to throw away his provender.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg366"><span class="f2 g"><b>[366]</b></span></a> 'Then that leader said to his carters:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This man, sirs, says that there has recently been much rain in the jungle,<br />
					that the roads are watered,<br />
					and there is plenty of grass<br />
					and wood<br />
					and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he advises us to throw away our provender,<br />
					so that, with lightened carts<br />
					we may travel quicker<br />
					and not weary our teams.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this man, Sirs,<br />
					is not a friend of ours,<br />
					nor a kinsman,<br />
					nor of our blood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should we act as if we trusted him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Our stock of provender is not to be thrown away;<br />
					let the caravan proceed<br />
					with the goods we brought;<br />
					let us not part with what we have."</p>

					<p class="f4">'"So be it, sir,"<br />
					agreed the carters,<br />
					and went on with the stock they had loaded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at seven successive camping places<br />
					they saw no grass<br />
					or wood<br />
					or water;<br />
					but they saw the other caravan<br />
					that had come to grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they saw the skeletons<br />
					of the men and cattle<br />
					devoured by that yakkha fiend.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then the caravan leader said to the carters:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That caravan, my masters,<br />
					met with ruin and disaster,<br />
					through having that silly caravan leader for its guide.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, let us leave here<br />
					such of our wares as are of little value,<br />
					and take from that caravan<br />
					such wares as are of great value.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, master,"<br />
					replied the carters,<br />
					and made the transfer,<br />
					and passed safely through the jungle,<br />
					through having this wise caravan leader<br />
					for their guide.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so you, Prince,<br />

					in that you seek so senselessly after another world,<br />
					even like that former caravan leader.</p>

					<p class="f4">They who fancy<br />
					that they can believe whatever they hear,<br />
					will meet with ruin and disaster,<br />
					even like those carters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Renounce, Prince,<br />

					<p class="f4">What if I were to carry it away?</p>

					<p class="f4">"So he spread out his cloak<br />
					and collecting the dry dung<br />
					tied it into a bundle<br />
					and lifting it on to his head went on.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the after-part of his journey<br />
					there fell a heavy shower of rain out of season.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, splashed with muck to his nail-tips,<br />
					bearing his oozing,<br />
					dripping dung-burden,<br />
					went on his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">And men seeing him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">" Good, friend," assented the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they came to where,<br />

					there was a certain village street.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they saw a heap of hemp thrown away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then one said to the other:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here's a heap of hemp:<br />

					<p class="f4">The other consented,<br />

					<p class="f4">Well then, friend,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I've brought this load of hemp a long way, friend,<br />

					<p class="f4">So the former changed his load<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well then, my dear Uttara,<br />
					do you arrange that such food shall be given as I eat,<br />
					and such garments be given as I wear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, sir,' replied Uttara,<br />
					and did so.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg373"><span class="f2 g"><b>[373]</b></span></a> Now prince Pāyāsi,<br />
					inasmuch as he had bestowed his gift without thoroughness,<br />
					not with his own hands,<br />
					without due thought,<br />
					as something discarded,<br />
					was, after his death,<br />
					reborn into the communion of the Four Great Kings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					in the empty mansion of the Acacia.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the youth Uttara,<br />
					who had objected to that gift<br />
					and had bestowed his gift thoroughly,<br />
					with his own hands,<br />
					with due thought,<br />
					not as something discarded,<br />
					was, after his death,<br />
					reborn in a bright and happy world,<br />
					into the communion of the Three-and-Thirty Gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">33.	Now at that time the venerable Gavampati<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> used frequently to go for siesta<br />
					to the empty mansion of the Acacia.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Pāyāsi,<br />
					now one of the gods,<br />
					came up to him and,<br />
					saluting him,<br />
					stood on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so standing the venerable Gavampati said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who art thou, friend?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, sir, am prince Pāyāsi.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wert thou not once of the opinion<br />
					that there was no other world,<br />
					no rebirth other than of parents,<br />
					no fruit or result of deeds<br />
					well or ill-done?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I was indeed, sir,<br />
					but through his reverence Kumāra Kassapa<br />
					I detached myself from that evil set of opinions.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But the youth Uttara,<br />
					who objected to thy gift, friend,<br />
					whereunto has he been reborn?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He, Sir, having objected to my gift,<br />
					and having himself bestowed a gift thoroughly,<br />
					with his own hands,<br />
					with due thought,<br />
					not as something discarded,<br />
					has, since he died,<br />
					been reborn in the bright and happy world,<br />
					into the communion of the Three-and-Thirty Gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, inasmuch as I bestowed my gift without thoroughness,<br />
					not with my own hand,<br />
					without due thought,<br />
					as something discarded,<br />
					was after my death <a id="pg374"><span class="f2 g"><b>[374]</b></span></a> reborn into the communion of the Four Great Kings,<br />
					in the empty mansion of Acacia.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Gavampati, Sir,<br />
					go thou into the world of men and tell them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Give ye your gifts with thoroughness,<br />
					with your own hands,<br />
					with due thought,<br />
					and give not as if ye were discarding somewhat.</p>

					<p class="f4">For so did not prince Pāyāsi;<br />
					and he after his death<br />
					was reborn into the communion of the Four Great Kings,<br />
					in the empty mansion of the Acacia.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the youth Uttara,<br />
					who bestowed his gifts in the right way,<br />
					was after his death reborn in the bright and happy world,<br />
					into the communion of the Three-and-Thirty Gods."'</p>

					<p class="f4">34.	So the venerable Gavampati came back to the world of men,<br />
					and there told these things.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">The Pāyāsi Dialogue is ended.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The touching story of his birth is told in the Introductory Story to the twelfth Jātaka, translated in Rhys Davids's 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 199 ff. [<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.1/jat.1.012.chlm.pts.htm">JAT 12</a>] He was declared by the Buddha to be the best of the preachers in the Order (A. I, 24). Kumāra was a nickname, 'The Boy' (because he was Ordained so young), which distinguished him from the other Kassapas in the Order, and clung to him even in advanced years. It was the more appropriate, as Kumāra means a boy of good family, a young gentleman, a master; and Kassapa, the son of a clansman, had been brought up at Pasenadi's court.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See Vol. I, p. 108, note 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The expression is somewhat ambiguous. See the note on 1,145.</p>

							<p>Two sticks are held in parallel. The first stick scrapes off the mire and the second stick pushes away the film of mire that rises up as it is scraped along the body. If there were only one stick the mire would fall back on the body. Do not ask me how I come to be so well acquainted with the methods for scraping mire off the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> No doubt a sort of brush made of split bamboo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> How elaborate were the coiffures used by men at this date may be seen from the illustration in Rhys Davids's <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.006.economics.htm#pg97">'Buddhist India,' p.97.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Velāmikā,</i> 'very young and childish.' says Buddhaghosa here. Above, p. 231, it seems to be a clan name, but used in a similar connexion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This story has been turned into a Jātaka by identifying the hero as the Buddha in a previous birth, and has been made the first story in the collection afterwards put together as the Jātaka Book. It is one of twelve stories in that book found in the older texts. See <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.011.jataka.htm#pg195">'Buddhist India,' p. 195.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This story is also in the Jātaka Book, I, 380. The <i>modus operandi</i> of the cheat is rendered obscure by our ignorance of the game played. Lüders in his 'Würfelspiel der alten Inder' has shown that the dice were seeds of a tree called the Vibhītaka, and that the usual game was probably to throw a number of seeds on a board, having previously fixed on a certain number.<br />
					The seeds fell some upright, some on their sides. Only the upright ones counted.<br />
					If they were less than the agreed number it was a draw; if equal the thrower won and threw again; if more he lost, and lost the throw.<br />
					An extra seed was called the kali, 'the unlucky die.' This the cheat seems to have managed to pick up, and swallow.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> So of the sacrifice intended by the Very Reverend Sir Gold-stick Sharp-tooth in the Kūṭadanta. See especially above, I, 163.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> To keep the robes down.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Vyāvaṭo.</i> This became almost a technical term in connexion with largesse. It is literally 'hindered'; but when the things to be given were too limited as compared with the number of applicants, some had to be passed over. They were <i>dāna-vyāvaṭa</i> 'hindered at the largesse' (Jat. Ill, 129). Compare D. II, 141; Sum. I, 296; Jat. I, 89; VVA. 298. But here perhaps it may simply mean 'objected to the largesse.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Literally 'do not associate (with him) in the next.' The gibe intended must be very nearly as we have rendered. But both the reading of the text and the grammatical construction are doubtful. The word we have rendered 'mocked' <i>(uddissati)</i> has only been found here. Perhaps it means 'showed (the matter) up,' which comes to much the same as to point the finger of mockery.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Apparently at his own cost.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The guardian spirits of the four quarters. See the Introduction to the Maha-samaya Suttanta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> He had been the son of a merchant at Benares; and had been received into the Order by the Buddha at the very beginning of his career as a teacher (Vin. I, 19). This legend supposes him, still a man, going for meditation to the lower heavens.</p>
