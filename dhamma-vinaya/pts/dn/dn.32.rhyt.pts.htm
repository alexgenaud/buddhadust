					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Āṭānāṭiya Suttanta</b></h4>

					<p>On this Suttanta we have already commented incidentally in <a href="dn.31.rhyt.pts.htm">the preceding</a> and the Mahā-Samaya Suttantas (II, 283). Here we wish very briefly to consider the position of these <i>rakkhan's, parittās</i> or prayers for safety in the Buddhist cult. <i>Parittā (pari-trā)</i> means protection, from a root <i>trā,</i> to rescue. It is a different word from the <i>parittaɱ</i> (<i>parītra,</i> limited, little) on which we have commented elsewhere.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> And it is more often used than its synonym <i>rakkhaɱ,</i> the term used here. A list of <i>parittās</i> is given in the <i>Questions of King Milinda</i> (trs. I, 231), and the sanction of their use is there made one of the horns of a dilemma, thus: — 'The <i>Parittās</i> were promulgated by the Blessed One, that is to say, the Ratana Sutta, the Khandha, Peacock, Banner-crest, Āṭānāṭiya and Angulimāla <i>Parittās</i>. Now if a man may not escape death, the Paritta is useless; if the <i>Parittā</i> saves him, it is not true that he cannot escape death.' All of these <i>Parittās</i> are translated into English. The Ratana is in the Khuddakapatha, translated by Childers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and the Sutta-Nipāta;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the Peacock is the <i>Jātaka</i> verses so called;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the Banner-crest is in the Sakka-Saijyutta;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> and the Angulimāla may be read in the <i>Theragātha</i> and the <i>Majjhima-Nikāya.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> The Khandha <i>parittā</i> is in the <i>Aŋguttara-Nikaya</i> (II., 72) and in the Cullavagga of the Vinaya.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> In the last-named works it is said to be 'allowed' by the Buddha 'as a watch, a guard, a protection for one's self for the use of the Order.' The occasion for this general injunction was the death of a member through snake-bite. The formula consists of a profession of amity towards the four tribes of snakes, an entreaty against injury from beasts, a prayer for the welfare of all beings. The profession of amity, according to Buddhist doctrine, was no mere matter of pretty speech.</p>

					<p><a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> It was to accompany and express a psychic suffusion of the hostile man or beast or spirit with benign, fraternal emotion — with <i>mettā.</i> For strong was the conviction, from Sutta and Vinaya to Buddhaghosa's Visuddhi-Magga,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> that 'thoughts are things,' that psychical action, emotional or intellectual, is capable of working like a force among forces. Europe may yet come round further to this Indian attitude.</p>

					<p>The belief in the effective power to heal, or protect, of the <i>saccakiriyā,</i> or asseveration of something quite true, is but another aspect of the work ascribed to the <i>parittā.</i>"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>It may well be that Buddhism was compelled to adopt and then adapt, in the <i>parittā,</i> the <i>rakshamantras</i> dear to its converts. There was wisdom shown by the teachers of the new successful Dhamma in making friends out of certain traditions and prejudices very hard to overcome. In moments of vital peril any conceivable means are clutched at that may avail to save. And it is chiefly as a cry for help in sickness that the <i>parittā</i>-rite or <i>pirit</i> survives yet in Ceylon. The simple ritual is described in Spence Hardy's <i>Eastern Monarchism,</i> p. 240, and in Gogerly's <i>Ceylon Buddhism,</i> edited by A. S. Bishop, p. 327 ff.</p>

					<p>But on the other hand there is an aspect under which these guarding runes are not alien to Buddhist doctrine, but are as much in harmony with it as is prayer with a theistic religion. This is not altogether because the agencies whose power to harm is deprecated are not, as in other cults, cursed and anathematized, but are blessed with good wishes, and suffused with an outgoing love. Though, for that matter, we cannot but linger for a moment to render homage to this wonderful vista of faith, wherein even the most malignant spirits and beasts were looked upon, not as hopelessly and eternally damned, but as erring unfortunates upon their agelong upward way, and capable of being doctored and softened by the lovely power of love. What we mean here is that the Buddhist's idea of the moral order reigning in the universe — an order or law which he called Dhamma — justifies him in the practice of the <i>parittā.</i> The kernel of Buddhist doctrine is insight into the moral cosmic order — into the eternal truth of Ill and of its arising and passing, and of the Path whereby it may be overpassed. But this order is not a finished, rigid, alien measure which may be <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> applied from without to life and conduct. It is not like an iron gallon jar which may be filled and emptied innumerable times with changing contents. It is more like an infinite web that living creatures themselves are ever weaving. The results of our actions are the web. The pattern that comes out as the web progresses is by us interpreted as moral law. It is a growing induction based on faith, namely, that good brings happiness, evil, unhappiness. And the actions with such pregnant results are acts not only of deed and speech, but also of feeling, thinking, and will. Each thread of the web is the result of some person's karma. Whether that karma be good or bad, the eternal shuttle weaves in the result. And at any given moment it requires, in making up the pattern, which is the fulfilling of the moral law, an act 'of mind, word, or deed from some being or beings. The Hebrew prophet in a fine inspiration conceived the Lord as 'waiting to be gracious.' So the Buddhist, his world teeming with the life and power of beings seen and unseen, all making their own karma, conceives the moral order as, so to speak, waiting for the action of this or that human or non-human being, contributing to the progress of its sempiternal fulfilment. Nāgasena, in the <i>Milinda</i> question, likens this, that we have called a 'waiting' for the human intercession in the <i>Parittā,</i> to the sick man's turning to the physician's remedies. Either means may avail if the patient's karma for this life be not exhausted. The fervent utterances of the <i>Parittā,</i> as synergy of thought sent forth by the utterers, are judged to be a possibly effective medicine no less than the muscular and material appliances of medical art. They are intended to range benign agencies on the side of the patient, and to keep far off those that may harm. Deities as conceived in other creeds were no longer invoked. Short of this, the parittas have yet much of the force of prayer. Balaam's aspiration: 'Let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his!' would be accounted as a prayer by both theist and Buddhist. Even Aaron's benediction of Israel: 'May the Lord bless thee and keep thee,' etc., is a votive uttering — a <i>voeu</i> — an invocation on the lines of the <i>parittās</i>. In these the power and goodness of the wonderful Teacher and Saviour, the truth of the Dhamma, the help of all holy ones — these are made present to the mind and give strength. The heart of unbounded love converts foes to friends, or else to powerlessness, and so drives out fear. So that whether it is to be a prolonged span of safety here, or whether life elsewhere is once more imminent, great allies have been called to aid and are standing by, and all is well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One teaches a code of abstaining from the taking of life, from theft, inchastity, lying and intemperance. But for the most part, lord, fairies do not abstain from any one of these things. To them such a code is distasteful and disagreeable.</p>

Such a creature, dear sir, would obtain at my royal city of Āḷakamandā neither site nor dwelling. He would not be received in any assembly of Yakkhas. And he would not be taken or given in marriage.

They are called rebels against the four kings. Even as brigand chiefs suppressed by the king of Magadha, so do they act. Now if any Yakkha whatever, or Gandhabba, Kumbhaṇḍa or Nāga should approach a brother or sister of the Order, or a lay-disciple, walking, standing, sitting or lying, with malevolent intent, then should [the molested one] incite and cry aloud and shout to those Yakkhas, the Great Yakkhas, their generals and commanders, saying: 'This Yakkha is seizing me, is assailing me, is hurting, injuring, harming me, and will not let me go!'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the Yakkhas, the Greater Yakkhas, the commanders, the chief commanders, who should be invoked.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. This, dear sir, is the ward rune whereby both brethren and sisters of the Order, and laymen and laywomen may dwell at ease, guarded, protected and unscathed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, dear sir, now we take our leave; we have many duties, much to do.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That, sires, is whenever you think fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Four King's arose from their seat, and saluting the Exalted One passed round him by his right and there and then vanished. And the Yakkhas arose from their seat some following the procedure of the four kings, some exchanging with the Exalted One friendly and courteous salutations, some stretching forth clasped hands, some announcing their name and family, some keeping silence. And so all there and then vanished.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. And when the night had passed, the Exalted One addressed the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">Last night while staying near Vulture's Peak the Four Kings having set a guard, a screen, a patrol over the four quarters with a great army of Yakkhas, of Gandhabbas, of Kumbhaṇḍas, went to Vulture's Peak when night was far spent, lighting up the whole mountain with their effulgent beauty. And there they saluted the me and sat down at one side. And of the [attendant] fairies some saluted only and sat down at one side, some exchanged greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and took their seats on one side; some saluted him with clasped hands, then sat down on one side; some called out their name and family, then sat down on one side; some sat down in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Vessavana so seated spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord! there are eminent fairies who do not believe in the Exalted One, and there are eminent fairies who do. There are also fairies of middle and of inferior rank who do not believe in him, and there are fairies of middle and of inferior rank who do. But for the most part, lord, fairies do not believe in the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One teaches a code of abstaining from the taking of life, from theft, inchastity, lying and intemperance. But for the most part, lord, fairies do not abstain from any one of these things. To them such a code is distasteful and disagreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, lord, there are disciples of the Exalted One who haunt the lonely and remote recesses of the forest, where noise, where sound there hardly is, where breezes from the pastures blow, hidden from men, suitable for meditation. There do eminent fairies dwell, who have no faith in the word of the Exalted One. That they may find faith, may the Exalted One learn the Āṭānāṭa ward-rune whereby both brethren and sisters of the Order, and laymen and laywomen may dwell at ease guarded, protected and unscathed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Vessavana, noting my consent, recited in that hour this ward-rune of Āṭānāṭa: —</p>

							Whence showers rain down. And there too stands the hall<br />
							Named Bhagalavati, where congregate<br />
							The Yakkha sprites. And round about are trees<br />
							Bearing perpetual fruit; their foliage<br />
							Swarming with divers birds and jubilant<br />
							With cry of peacock and of heron and the song<br />

					<p class="f4">This, dear Sir, is the ward rune, whereby both brethren and sisters of the Order, and laymen and laywomen may dwell at ease, guarded, protected and unscathed.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The Buddha acquiesces as if he did not know this <i>rakshamantra</i> (here called <i>rakkhaɱ.)</i> To safeguard the doctrine of his omniscience, the Commentary explains the king's word as intended to create an opportunity for others to learn, Gotama lending the undertaking the prestige of his authority.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The Commentary calls this a town. <i>Cf.</i> below, p. 193.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> B. apparently interprets these (who are 'freed': <i>nibbuta</i> by the Nibbāna of the <i>kilesas</i>) as Arahants. But, he says, 'the Commentary'  refers this and the next two lines to the Buddhas, and in the fourth line only understands 'the wise' to be meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> These lines are not part of the formula elsewhere. 'By, or with, goodness': <i>kusalena,</i> a curious, unusual phrase. B. gives 'pure wisdom,' 'omniscience' as alternative meanings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> <i>Pacchima</i> is both 'West' and 'last.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> So B. 'no woman property'; no 'mineness' which says 'this is my wife'; and no desire for possession.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup><i>Akaṭṭha-pāk imaɱ sāliɱ</i> is apparently the right reading.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> So B. explains <i>tuṇḍikīre.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>Taɱ pitthi abhiruyha</i> is B.'s only explanation of the curious term <i>ekakhuraɱ katvā.</i></p>
