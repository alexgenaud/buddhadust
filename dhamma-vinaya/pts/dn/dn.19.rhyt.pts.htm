					<h4>Introduction To The Mahā-Govinda Suttanta</h4>

					<p>T<span class="f2">HIS</span> Suttanta is certainly, in some respects, among the most interesting in the collection; and for the history of the literature is of great importance.</p>

					<p>The subject is twofold, both necessary points at the time, and both scarcely intelligible, without a little attention, to modern Western minds. Even in the East, and to Buddhists, the story now seems somewhat strange and antiquated. The success of the method of argument here adopted has been so far complete that the need of the argument has ceased, the point of view has changed, and the Suttanta, among the most popular in early times, is now, compared to others dealing with the positive side of the doctrine, considered of minor value.</p>

					<p>The two points are those of the brahmins and the gods. The method of the argument is not to argue about anything; to accept the opponents' position throughout, and simply to out-flank it by making the gods and the brahmins themselves act and speak as quite good Buddhists, and take for granted the Buddhist position on ethical matters. This is of course, from one point of view, logically absurd. No militant brahmin, in favour of the pecuniary or social advantages allowed to brahmins by birth, would speak or act thus. No god, as he was supposed by his worshippers to be (and he existed only as such), would speak or act thus. But the composer (or composers) of the Govinda knew this quite well. And he is (or they are) scrupulously polite. The actions imputed to the brahmin and the gods, the words put into their mouths, are quite admirable. No one can blame the story-teller that they happen also to be Buddhist. The question as to what the good brahmin ought to be, what a good god ought to do or say, is quietly begged in the most delicate way. On this point — the ethical doctrine — the narrator is thoroughly in earnest; and he no less thoroughly enjoys the irony of the incongruities involved. It is the fashion to label all Buddhist writings, without discrimination, as insufferably dull; and the fashion <a id="pg254"><span class="f2 g"><b>[254]</b></span></a> will be kept up, no doubt, among those who do not see the point of the really very able way in which, sometimes, it is all done. But we may be permitted to appreciate a clever story (even with a moral) in spite of the fact that the story part is a story — all make-believe, none of it historically true.</p>

					<p>It has been pointed out above (Vol. I, 208), how a brahmin law book, at a time when the increasing respect paid to Wanderers and Bhikkhus threatened loss of prestige and profit to the sacrificing priests, puts into the mouth of Prajāpati the ferocious remark that he who praises such people (the wandering teachers, etc.) 'becomes dust and perishes.' The writer hoped (quite in vain as it turned out) to gain acceptance for his view by attributing it to a deity. This polemical device was quite in accord with the literary ethics of the day. The choice of the god has an artistic touch, and the anecdote <i>se non è vero è ben trovato.</i> Quite a number of other instances might be quoted from Indian books of all ages, though not from Pāli works later than the Nikāyas, nor from works written in Ceylon or Burma. And they are found also in other lands and other literatures. The device is peculiar, not to India, but to a certain stage in religious beliefs and literary taste. It is not in reality so good a device as, at first sight, it seems to be. There are many instances, like the one just quoted, where it has altogether failed. As applied here, in the Govinda, the device has failed as regards the brahmins.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn1" href="#in1">i1</a>]</sup></span> Where it has had a measure of success (that is, where the opinion thus fathered on a deity has become more or less an accepted opinion), it probably owes more to its validity, or to its appeal to the feeling of the times, than to the help of the deity invoked. The reader may be reminded that the habit of assuming that the deity is on one's own side, of taking it for granted that He shares one's own opinions, comes out quite clearly in modes of expression in constant use, even by very exalted personages, in the Europe of to-day.</p>

					<p>Our Suttanta introduces us, in the first scene of the play, to heaven. There the gods rejoice at the increase in their numbers through the appearance, in their midst, of new gods produced by the good Karma of the followers of the new view of life put forward by Gotama. The king of the gods voices their satisfaction in a hymn; and then utters, in eight paragraphs, a eulogy on the Buddha. In scene two the still higher god, Mahā-brahmā, appears. He desires to hear the eulogy, which is accordingly repeated for his benefit. He approves of it, and <a id="pg255"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span></a> adds that the Exalted One had long been as wise as that. In support of this he then tells the story which forms the second act, as it were, in many scenes. Here we have Brahmā's view (that is, the view of the author or authors of the Govinda) concerning the ideal brahmin. It is really very funny; whether we compare it with the actual brahmin of to-day, or with the brahmin as described in the epics and the law books, or with the brahmin as he probably really was in the Buddha's time. The last must have been in the authors' mind all the time; and the incongruity, though quite courteous, is sufficiently startling.</p>

					<p>The episode told in Act I, Scenes 1 and 2, has already occurred, nearly word for word, in the Jana-vasabha: -</p>

					<p>Jana-vasabha 12, 13 = Govinda 2, 3.<br />
					Jana-vasabha 14-19 = Govinda 14-18.</p>

					<p>The intervening passage (Govinda 4-13) contains Sakka's eulogy. A eulogy is also part of the Jana-vasabha (§§ 22 ff.). But it is there put, at a later stage in the episode, into the mouth of Brahma, and deals accordingly with much deeper matters<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn2" href="#in2">i2</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p>What is the conclusion to be drawn from these facts? They would be explained if the episode had existed in the community before either of these Suttantas had been put into its present shape; and had been so popular that it had been worked up, by different authors, in slightly differing ways. Or the author or authors of either Suttanta might have altered an episode, already incorporated in the other, to harmonize better with the particular lines of his own story. In that case it must be the Govinda version that is the later. In it the eulogy is put into the mouth of Sakka, and altered to suit that divinity, because Brahmā's speech was wanted for the story to follow. In either case it is evident that, at the time when these Suttantas were put together as we have them, the legendary material current among the community was still in a fluid, unstable, condition, so that it was not only possible, it was considered quite the proper thing, to add to or alter it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn3" href="#in3">i3</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> The whole story is retold, in a Sanskrit dialect and in different phraseology and order, in the Mahāvastu, The following table will make the degree of the resemblance and difference plain.</p>

					<p>Now we do not know exactly when and where Buddhists began to write in Sanskrit, though it was probably in Kashmir some time before the beginning of our era. They did not then translate into Sanskrit any Pāli book. They wrote new books. And the reason for this was twofold. In the first place they had already come to believe things very different from those contained in the canon; they were no longer in full sympathy with it. In the second place, though Pāli was never the vernacular of Kashmir, it was widely known there, and even very probably still used for literary work; translations were therefore not required.</p>

					<p>This gives a possible explanation of the most astounding <a id="pg257"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span></a> fact we know about the Mahāvastu. It purports to be the Vinaya (that is, the Rules regulating the outward conduct of the members of the Order), as held by the school of the Lokottara-vadins. In M. Senart's admirable edition it fills three bulky volumes. There is not, from beginning to end of them, even one single Rule of the Order! No explanation has been given of this extraordinary state of things, though it was pointed out at once on the publication of the edition.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn4" href="#in4">i4</a>]</sup></span> Prof. Windisch in his able discussion (just above referred to) of the actual contents of the book does not refer to this remarkable omission.</p>

					<p>The old Vinaya begins with the Sutta Vibhanga, that is, the Rules themselves elucidated by discussion of their origin and meaning. This occupies 615 pages in Oldenberg's editions. Then follow in 660 pages the Khandhakas, twenty-two in number, dealing with various points of Canon Law. At the beginning of these is an Introduction, explaining how the Order arose; and at the end an Appendix, on the Councils.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn5" href="#in5">i5</a>]</sup></span> This old Vinaya has never been translated into Sanskrit. The Mahāvastu is based on the Introduction to the Khandhakas, rewritten, added to, enormously expanded, and arranged according to the order of the Pāli Nidana Kathā. Now why did the Lokottara-vādins, in their Vinaya, omit practically the whole of the Vinaya, and confine themselves to rewriting the Introduction to what is only a part of the Vinaya? Why did not they also rewrite the rest? May it be because, when they wrote, the old rules and explanations, with which they did not quarrel in the least, were still well known and used in the original Pāli, or in some closely cognate shape?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn6" href="#in6">i6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>It must have been from some such cognate recension, and not from our Pāli text, that the Govinda story was Sanskritised. The differences between the Dīgha and the Mahāvastu are too great to have arisen at one stage. The whole point of the story in the Dīgha is the way in which Brahmā describes his <a id="pg258"><span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span></a> ideal brahmin as quite emancipated from animistic superstitions and practices. He gains access to Brahmā by practising (with reference, no doubt, to the closing scene of the Mahā-Sudassana, and also to the Tevijjā and other passages) the Rapture of Mercy, one of the Brahma-vihāras, or Sublime Conditions. The Mahāvastu is not satisfied with that. It makes him add to it the kindling of the mystic Fire, Agni (D. II, 239 and Mhvst. III, 210). The paean of delight at the arrival of the new gods (D. II, 227 and Mhvst. III, 203) is introduced in the Mahāvastu by the words: 'He (Brahmā) addressed them in verses.' But it gives only one verse. The others are found in the Dīgha. Perhaps their ethical standpoint did not appeal any more to the Lokottara-vādins. In the eulogy on the Buddha (D.II, 222 and Mhvst. III, 199) the Mahāvastu mentions that there are eight points concerning which the Buddha was worthy of praise. It gives, however, only seven, differing in order and meaning from the eight given in the Dīgha. Verbal differences throughout the whole story are found in almost every paragraph.</p>

					<p>In column 136 of Bunyiu Nanjio's catalogue of Chinese Buddhist books we find mentioned a translation of the Mahā-Govinda evidently from some recension different from the Pāli. It would be interesting to know whether there has, in this version, been preserved an intermediate stage between the Dīgha and the Mahāvastu.</p>

					and filled with joy and happiness<br />
					over the things they had heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">13.	'Then certain gods, lord, spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh! sir, if only four supreme Buddhas might arise in the world<br />
					and teach the Doctrine<br />
					even as the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">That would make for the welfare of the many,<br />
					for the happiness of the many,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And certain other gods spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would suffice, sir,<br />
					if there arose three supreme Buddhas might arise in the world<br />
					and teach the Doctrine<br />
					even as the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">That would make for the welfare of the many,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And certain other gods spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would suffice, sir, if two supreme Buddhas might arise in the world<br />

					<p class="f4">That would make for the welfare of the many,<br />
					for the happiness of the many,<br />

					and the weal<br />
					of gods and men."</p>

					<p class="f4">14. 'Then answered Sakka, ruler of the gods<br />
					to the Three-and-Thirty:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nowhere, gentlemen,<br />
					and at no time<br />
					is it possible<br />
					that, in one and the same world-system,<br />
					two Arahant Buddhas supreme should arise together,<br />
					neither before<br />
					nor after the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">This can in no wise be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah! gentlemen<br />
					would that this Blessed One might yet live for long years to come,<br />
					free from disease<br />
					and free from suffering!</p>

					<p class="f4">That would make for the welfare of the many,<br />
					for the happiness of the many,<br />
					for loving compassion to the universe,<br />
					for the good<br />
					and the gain<br />
					and the weal<br />
					of gods and men!"</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, lord, the Three-and-Thirty gods<br />
					having thus deliberated<br />
					and taken counsel together<br />
					concerning the matter for which they were assembled<br />
					and seated in the Hall of Good Counsel,<br />
					with respect to that matter<br />
					the Four Kings were receivers of the spoken word,<br />
					the Four Great Kings were receivers of the admonition given,<br />
					remaining the while in their places,<br />
					not retiring.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg264"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Taking the uttered word and speech,<br />
					the Kings Stood there,<br />
					serene and calm,<br />
					each in his place.</p>

					<p class="f4">15.	'Then, lord, from out of the North<br />
					came forth a splendid light,<br />
					and a radiance shone around,<br />
					surpassing the divine glory of the gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then did Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br />
					say to the dwellers in the heaven of the Three-and-Thirty:</p>

					<p class="f4">"According, gentlemen, to the signs now seen,<br />
					the light that ariseth,<br />
					the radiance that appeareth —<br />
					will Brahmā now be made manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is the herald sign of the manifestation of Brahmā,<br />
					when the light ariseth<br />
					and the glory shineth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even by yonder signs<br />
					great Brahmā draweth nigh.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this is Brahmāā's sign,<br />
					this glorious splendour vast.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, lord, the Three-and-Thirty gods<br />
					sat down again in their own places, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will ascertain<br />
					what shall be the result of this radiance;<br />
					when we have realized it,<br />
					we will go to meet him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Four Kings also sat down in their places,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will ascertain<br />
					what shall be the result of this radiance;<br />
					when we have realized it,<br />
					we will go to meet him."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they heard that,<br />
					the Three-and-Thirty gods were all agreed saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will ascertain<br />
					what shall be the result of this radiance;<br />
					when we have realized it,<br />
					we will go to meet him."</p>

					<p class="f4">16.	When, lord, Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra appears before the Thirty-Three gods,<br />
					he manifest himself as an individual of relatively gross substance<br />
					which he has specially created.</p>

					<p class="f4">For Brahmā's usual appearance<br />
					is not sufficiently materialized<br />
					for the scope of the sight of the Thirty-Three Gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, lord, when Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra is manifested before the Thirty-Three Gods,<br />
					he outshines the other gods<br />
					in his appearance and his glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, lord, as a figure made of gold<br />
					outshines the human frame,<br />
					so, when Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra is manifested before the Thirty-Three Gods,<br />
					does he outshine the other gods<br />
					in his appearance and his glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, lord, Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra is manifested <a id="pg265"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span></a> before the Thirty-Three Gods,<br />
					not one god in that assembly salutes him,<br />
					or rises up,<br />
					or invites him to be seated.</p>

					<p class="f4">They all sit in silence,<br />
					with clasped hands<br />
					and cross-legged,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of whichever god Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra now desires anything,<br />
					he will sit down on that god's divan."</p>

					<p class="f4">And that god by whom he does so seat himself,<br />
					is filled with a sublime satisfaction,<br />
					a sublime happiness,<br />
					even as a Kshatriya king<br />
					newly anointed and crowned<br />
					is filled with a sublime satisfaction,<br />
					a sublime happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Then, lord, Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra perceiving how gratified were those Three-and-Thirty gods,<br />
					uttered his approval in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The Three-and-Thirty, verily, both gods and lord, rejoice,<br />
							Tathāgata they honour and the cosmic law sublime,<br />
							Whereas they see these gods new-risen, beautiful and bright,<br />
							Who erst the holy life had lived, under the Happy One,<br />
							The Mighty Sage's hearers, who had won to higher truths,<br />
							Come hither; and in glory all the other gods outshine.<br />
							This they behold right gladly, both lord and Thirty-Three,<br />
							Tathāgata they honour and the cosmic law sublime.</p>

					<p class="f4">18.	This was the matter of Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra's speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he spoke it with a voice of eightfold quality —<br />
					in a voice that was fluent,<br />
					intelligible,<br />
					sweet,<br />
					audible,<br />
					sustained,<br />
					distinct,<br />
					deep,<br />
					and resonant.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whereas, lord, Brahmā Sanaɱkumāra<br />
					made himself audible to that assembly by his voice,<br />
					the sound thereof did not penetrate beyond the assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">He whose voice has these eight characteristics<br />
					is said to have a Brahmā-voice.</p>

					<p class="f4">19.	'Then, lord, to Brahmā the Eternal Youth the Three-and-Thirty gods spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Tis well, O Brahmā!<br />
					we do rejoice at this that we have noted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover Sakka, ruler of the gods,<br />
					<a id="pg266"><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></a> hath rehearsed to us<br />

					<p class="f4">'Then, lord, Brahmā the Eternal Youth spoke thus to Sakka, ruler of the gods:</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, O Great Brahmā,"<br />
					replied Sakka.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'These eight true praises, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">28. 'And so, lord, Brahmā the Eternal Youth materializing himself and becoming in appearance like the youth Five-crest,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he addressed the Three-and-Thirty gods thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">29.	"Now what think ye, my lord gods Thirty-and-Three?</p>

					<p class="f4">For how long hath the Blessed One been of great wisdom?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time there was a king named Disampati.</p>

					<p class="f4">And king Disampati's minister was a brahmin named Govinda (the Steward).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And king Disampati had a son named Reṇu,<br />
					and Govinda had a son named Jotipāla.</p>

					<p class="f4">And prince Reṇu<br />
					and the young Jotipāla<br />
					and six other young nobles —<br />
					these eight—were great friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the course of years Govinda <a id="pg267"><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span></a> died.</p>

					<p class="f4">And king Disampati mourned for him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! just when we had devolved all our duties on Govinda the brahmin,<br />
					and were surrounded by<br />
					and giving ourselves up to<br />
					the pleasures of sense,<br />
					Govinda has died!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said prince Reṇu to the king:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Mourn not, sire, so excessively for Govinda, the brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Govinda has a son,<br />
					young Jotipāla,<br />
					who is wiser than his father was,<br />
					better able to see what is profitable than his father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let Jotipāla administer all such affairs<br />
					as were entrusted to his father.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you think so, my boy?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do, sire.'</p>

					<p class="f4">30.	Then king Disampati summoned a man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come you, good man,<br />
					go to Master Jotipāla, and say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May good fortune attend the honourable Jotipāla!</p>

					<p class="f4">King Disampati calls for the honourable Jotipāla.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Disampati would like to see the honourable Jotipāla."</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, sire,'<br />
					responded the man,<br />
					and going to Jotipāla he repeated the message.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, sir,'<br />
					responded Jotipāla,<br />
					and went to wait upon the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come into the king's presence,<br />
					he exchanged with the king the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and sat down on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said king Disampati to Jotipāla:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would have the honourable youth Jotipāla administer for us.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him not refuse to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will set him in his father's place<br />
					and appoint him to the Stewardship."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, sire,'<br />
					replied Jotipāla in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">31.	So king Disampati appointed Jotipāla as his Steward,<br />
					and set him in his father's place.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus appointed and installed,<br />
					whatever matters his father had administered,<br />
					those did Jotipāla administer;<br />
					and <a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> whatever his father had not administered,<br />
					those matters did he too not administer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever works his father had accomplished,<br />
					and no others,<br />
					even such works,<br />
					and no others,<br />
					did he too accomplish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of him men said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The brahmin is verily a Steward!</p>

					<p class="f4">A Great Steward is verily this brahmin!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And on this wise Jotipāla came to be called the High Steward.</p>

					<p class="f4">32.	Now it came to pass that the Great Steward went to those six nobles,<br />
					and said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Disampati the king is old<br />
					and wasted with age,<br />
					full of years,<br />
					and arrived at the term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Who indeed can answer for the survival of the living?</p>

					<p class="f4">When the king dies,<br />
					it will behove the king-makers to anoint Reṇu the prince as king.</p>

					<p class="f4">I suggest, gentlemen,<br />
					that you wait on prince Reṇu,<br />
					and say to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are the dear, beloved, and congenial friends of our lord Reṇu.</p>

					<p class="f4">We are happy when our lord is happy;<br />
					unhappy when he is unhappy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disampati, our lord king,<br />
					is old and wasted with age,<br />
					full of years and arrived at the term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Who indeed can answer for the living?</p>

					<p class="f4">When the king dies,<br />
					it will behove the kingmakers<br />
					to anoint our lord Reṇu king.</p>

					<p class="f4">If our lord Reṇu should gain the sovereignty,<br />
					let him divide it with us."'</p>

					<p class="f4">33.	'So be it,'<br />
					responded the six nobles,<br />
					and waiting upon prince Reṇu<br />
					they repeated these words to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, sirs, who besides myself<br />
					ought to prosper in this realm<br />
					if it be not you?</p>

					<p class="f4">If I, sirs, shall gain the sovereignty,<br />
					I will divide it with you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">34. And it came to pass in course of time<br />
					that king Disampati died.</p>

					<p class="f4">And after his death,<br />
					the kingmakers anointed Reṇu his son king.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he, when he was made king,<br />
					lived surrounded by<br />
					and given up to<br />
					the pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the High Steward went to those six nobles and said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Disampati, gentlemen, is dead,<br />
					and my lord Reṇu lives surrounded by<br />
					and given up to<br />
					the pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, gentlemen, who can say?</p>

					<p class="f4">The pleasures of sense are intoxicating,<br />
					I would suggest, gentlemen,<br />
					<a id="pg269"><span class="f2 g"><b>[269]</b></span></a> that you wait on king Reṇu<br />
					and say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"King Disampati, my lord, is dead,<br />
					my lord Reṇu is anointed king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does my lord remember his promise?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, sir,'<br />
					responded the six nobles,<br />
					and going into Reṇu's presence,<br />
					they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'King Disampati, sire, is dead,<br />
					and my lord Reṇu is anointed king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does my lord remember his promise?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do remember my promise, gentlemen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of you gentlemen now<br />
					is able successfully to divide this mighty [land<br />
					so broad on the north and,<br />
					<i>Sakaṭamukka.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> on the south,<br />
					into seven equal portions?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who, sire, is able<br />
					if it be not the Great Steward, the brahmin?'</p>

					<p class="f4">55. Then king Reṇu sent a man to the Great Steward, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, my good fellow,<br />
					go to the Great Steward, the brahmin, and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The king has sent for you, my lord.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Great Steward was told and obeyed,<br />
					and, coming into the king's presence,<br />
					exchanged with him the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and sat down on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the king to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Will you go, my lord Steward,<br />
					and so divide this great [land<br />
					so broad at the north end,<br />
					as narrow at the south as the pole of a bull cart,]<br />
					into seven portions, all equal.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, sire,'<br />
					responded the High Steward,<br />
					and he so divided this great [land<br />
					so broad at the north end,<br />
					as narrow at the south as the pole of a bull cart,]<br />
					into seven portions, all equal.</p>

					<p class="f4">36.	And king Reṇu's country held the central position.</p>

					<p class="f4">As it is said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg270"><span class="f2 g"><b>[270]</b></span></a> Dantapura of the Kālingas, and Potana for the Assakas,<br />

							Mithila of the Videhās, and then Campā among the Aŋgas,<br />
							Lastly Benares in the Kāsi realm: — all these did the Great Steward wisely plan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then were those six nobles well pleased each with his allotted gain,<br />
					and at the success of his plan.</p>

					<p class="f4">For they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What we wished for,<br />
					what we desired,<br />
					what we intended,<br />
					what we aimed at,<br />
					lo! that is what we have gotten.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the seven kings were named:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Sattabhu and Brahmādatta,<br />
							Vessabhu with Bharata,<br />
							Reṇu and two Dhaṭaraṭṭhas:<br />

					<h3 class="ctr">Chapter II</h3>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg271"><span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span></a> 37. Now those six nobles came to the High Steward and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just as the honourable Steward<br />
					was dear, beloved and congenial<br />
					as companion to Reṇu the king,<br />
					so has he been also to us a companion,<br />
					dear, beloved and congenial.</p>

					<p class="f4">We would that the honourable Steward administer our affairs;<br />
					we trust he will not refuse to do so.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, sirs'<br />
					replied the Great Steward.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so he instructed those seven anointed kings in government;<br />
					and he taught the mantras to seven eminent and wealthy Brahmāns<br />
					and to seven hundred young graduates.</p>

					<p class="f4">38. Now later on<br />
					the excellent reputation of the brahmin, the High Steward,<br />
					was noised abroad after this fashion:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With his own eyes<br />
					the High Steward sees Brahmā!</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face<br />
					does the High Steward commune with Brahmā,<br />
					converse and take counsel with Him!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the High Steward thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This flattering rumour is noised abroad about me,<br />
					that I both see Brahmā<br />
					and hold converse with Him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I neither see Him,<br />
					nor commune with Him,<br />
					nor converse<br />
					or take counsel with Him.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have heard aged and venerable brahmins,<br />
					teachers and pupils, say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who remains in meditation the four months of the rains,<br />
					and practises the ecstasy of pity,<br />
					<i>he</i> sees Brahmā,<br />
					communes,<br />
					converses,<br />
					takes counsel with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I now were to cultivate that discipline?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">39.	So the High Steward waited on king Reṇu,<br />
					and telling him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This flattering rumour is noised abroad about me,<br />
					that I both see Brahmā<br />
					and hold converse with Him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I neither see Him,<br />
					nor commune with Him,<br />
					nor converse<br />
					or take counsel with Him.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have heard aged and venerable brahmins,<br />
					teachers and pupils, say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who remains in meditation the four months of the rains,<br />
					and practises the ecstasy of pity,<br />
					<i>he</i> sees Brahmā,<br />

					<p class="f4">'I wish, sir, to meditate<br />
					during the four months of the rains<br />
					and to practise the ecstasy of pity.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one is to come near me<br />
					save some one who will bring me my meals.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do, honourable Steward, whatever seems to you fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">40. And the High Steward went round to each of the six nobles,<br />
					and told them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This flattering rumour is noised abroad about me,<br />
					that I both see Brahmā<br />
					and hold converse with Him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I neither see Him,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Do, honourable Steward, whatever seems to you fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">41.	Then he went to those seven eminent and wealthy Brahmāns,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Wherefore, sirs, according as you have heard the mantras<br />
					and have committed them to memory,<br />
					continue to rehearse them in full,<br />
					and teach them to each other.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sirs, wish to meditate during the four months of the rains,<br />

					<p class="f4">No one is to come near me<br />

					<p class="f4">'Do, honourable Steward, whatever seems to you fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">42. Next the High Steward went to his forty wives<br />
					who were all on an equality,<br />
					and told them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This flattering rumour is noised abroad about me,<br />
					that I both see Brahmā<br />
					and hold converse with Him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I neither see Him,<br />

					<p class="f4">But I have heard aged and venerable brahmins,<br />

					<p class="f4">I, sisters, wish to meditate during the four months of the rains,<br />
					and to practise the ecstasy of pity.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one is to come near me<br />
					save some one who shall bring me my meals.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do, honourable Steward, whatever seems to you fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">43.	Then the High Steward had a new rest-house built eastward of the city,<br />
					and there for the four months of the rains he meditated,<br />
					rapt in the Ecstasy of Pity;<br />
					nor did any one have access to him<br />
					save one who brought him his meals.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the four rainy months were over,<br />
					then verily came disappointment and anguish over him<br />
					as he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here have I heard aged and venerable brahmins,<br />
					teachers and their pupils, say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who remains in meditation the four months of the rains,<br />
					and practises the Ecstasy of Pity,<br />
					he sees Brahmā,<br />
					communes,<br />
					converses,<br />
					and takes counsel with Brahmā."</p>

					<p class="f4">But I see not Brahmā,<br />
					I commune not,<br />
					nor converse,<br />
					nor take counsel with Him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">44.	Then Brahmā, the Eternal Youth,<br />
					when in his mind<br />
					he knew the thoughts of the High Steward's mind,<br />
					vanished from his heaven,<br />
					and, like a strong man shooting his arm out<br />
					or drawing back his out-shot arm,<br />
					appeared before the High Steward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then verily came fear,<br />
					then came trembling<br />
					upon the High Steward,<br />
					then did the hair of his flesh stand up<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					when he saw this thing that had never been seen before.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he,<br />
					full of fear and dread<br />
					with stiffening hair,<br />
					addressed Brahmā the Eternal Youth in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> 'O Vision fair, O glorious and divine!<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">'In heaven supreme I'm known<br />
							As the Eternal Youth. All know me there.<br />
							Know me e'en thou, Govinda.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'To a Brahmā Blest<br />
							Let seat and water for the feet and sweet<br />
							Cooked cakes and drink be brought. We ask what gift<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Hereby we take thy gift,<br />
							And now — whether it be for good and gain<br />
							In this thy present life, or for thy weal<br />
							In that which shall be — Thou hast leave. Come, ask,<br />
							Govinda, whatsoe'er thou fain would'st have?'</p>

					<p class="f4">45.	Then the High Steward thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Leave is given me by Brahmā the Eternal Youth!</p>

					<p class="f4">What now shall I ask of him,<br />
					some good thing for this life,<br />
					or a future good?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am an expert regarding what is profitable for this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even others consult me about that.</p>

					<p class="f4">What now if I were to ask Brahmā the Eternal Youth<br />
					for something of advantage in a life to come?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he addressed the god in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'I ask the Brahmā, the Eternal Youth,<br />
							Him past all doubt I, doubting, ask anent<br />
							The things that others would fain know about.<br />
							Wherein proficient, in what method trained<br />
							Can mortal reach th' immortal world of Brāhm?'<br />
 							<a id="pg274"><span class="f2 g"><b>[274]</b></span></a> 							'He among men, O Brahmān, who eschews<br />

 							Herein proficient, in such matters trained,<br />
 							Mortal can reach th' immortal heaven of Brāhm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">46.	'What the Lord saith touching<br />
					"eschewing all claims of 'me' and 'mine'"<br />
					I understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is to renounce all property<br />
					whether it be small or large,<br />
					and to renounce all family life,<br />
					whether the circle of one's kin be small or large,<br />
					and with hair and beard cut off<br />
					and yellow robes donned,<br />
					to go forth from the home into the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus do I understand this.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What the Lord saith touching<br />
					"thought rising in lonely calm"<br />
					I understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is when one chooses a solitary abode —<br />
					the forest,<br />
					at the foot of a tree,<br />
					a mountain brae,<br />
					a grotto,<br />
					a rock-cavern,<br />
					a cemetery,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus do I understand this.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What the Lord saith touching<br />

					<p class="f4">It is when one continues to pervade<br />

					and so the second quarter,<br />
					and so the third,<br />
					and so the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus the whole wide world,<br />

					around and everywhere<br />
					does one continue to pervade<br />
					with a heart charged with pity,<br />
					far-reaching,<br />
					expanded,<br />
					infinite,<br />
					free from wrath and ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus do I understand this.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Only in what He saith touching<br />
					"loathing the foul"<br />
					do I not understand thee, Lord.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'What mean'st thou by<br />
							"foul odours among men,"<br />
							O	Brahmā? here I understand thee not.<br />
							Tell what these signify, who knowest all.<br />
							When cloaked and clogged by what is man thus foul.<br />
							Hell-doomed, and shut off from the heaven of Brāhm?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Anger and lies, deceit and treachery,<br />

							<a id="pg275"><span class="f2 g"><b>[275]</b></span></a> Greed, doubt, and lifting hands 'gainst fellow men,<br />

					<p class="f4">'As I understand the word of the Lord concerning these<br />

					<p class="f4">I will therefore go forth from the home<br />

					<p class="f4">47.	Then the High Steward waited on king Reṇu<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in1" href="#ifn1">i1</a>]</sup> This question has been fully discussed, and the reasons for the failure given, above, VoL I, pp. 105, 138 ff., and especially 141.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in2" href="#ifn2">i2</a>]</sup> This difference in the mental endowments of the two gods, — the one the mere king of the gods, an Indian Zeus; and the other the Great First Cause, the outcome of the highest speculation — is always carefully observed in the various speeches ascribed, in the early Buddhist texts, to these divinities. See above, p. 175, for another instance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in3" href="#ifn3">i3</a>]</sup> The doctrinal material stands on a different footing. Already in 1877 I ventured to point out the difference (in 'Buddhism,' pp. 86-7), and the point has since increasingly forced itself upon my notice. Professor Windisch (in 'Die Composition des Mahāvastu' Leipzig, 1909, p. 494) supports this view.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in4" href="#ifn4">i4</a>]</sup> Rhys Davids, <i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1898, 424.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in5" href="#ifn5">i5</a>]</sup> There is a supplementary work, the Parivāra, much shorter, and consisting mainly of what we should now call examination papers. This volume, though most interesting from the point of view of the history of Indian education, presupposes the old Vinaya, and is later.<br />
					As is well known the Khandhakas come first in Oldenberg's edition, but the order in the MSS. is as above. See for instance Oldenberg's 'Catalogue of the Pāli MSS. in the India Office Library,' <i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1882, p. 59.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in6" href="#ifn6">i6</a>]</sup> Compare Oldenberg's remarks on the Chinese translations of Vinaya at the end of his introduction to the Pāli Text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> In Milinda, these contrasted distinctions are given to illustrate the exercise of <i>sati</i> ('minding' or 'remembering') by way of careful practice. 'Questions of King Milinda,' i. 58.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Ajjhāsayaɱ ādi-brahmacariyaɱ.</i> Buddhaghosa says these two words are to be taken distributively, and refer to his lofty intentions and to the ethics of the Aryan Path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> This sounds very much as if the Four Great Kings were looked upon as Recorders (in their memory, of course) of what had been said. They kept the minutes of the meeting. If so (the gods being made in the image of men) there must have been such Recorders at the meetings in the Mote Halls of the clans.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The Cy. here supplements: Himself desirous of clearing up this problem, it is as if he went on to say, that there was nothing wonderful in that, so he tells the story.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> It is evident from §§ 30, 31 that Govinda, literally 'Lord of the Herds,' was a title, not a name, and means Treasurer or Steward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Govindiye abhisiñcissāmi.</i> Literally, 'I will anoint him to the Govinda-ship' (the Lordship over the herds).

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Sakaṭamukka.</i> This adjective, applied here to the earth, and at the end of the next section to the seven kingdoms, is at present quite unintelligible; and is left untranslated. The traditional explanations differ. Samarasekara (Colombo, 1905) translates here (p. 1016) <i>dakuṇu pasin gael mukhayak lesaṭa,</i> that is, 'on the south side like a waggon's mouth.' Buddhaghosa has nothing here; but below as applied to the kingdoms he explains 'with their mouths debouching together.' Neither is satisfactory. It has been suggested that it might mean 'facing the Wain,' that is, the constellation of the Great Bear. But this is unfortunately in the North. The front opening of a bullock waggon is (now) elliptical in form.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This list is enough lo show that the verses do not fit with the story. Reṇu's kingdom is said in the text to be in the middle. No one of these seven kingdoms is in the midst of the others. Benares would suit that position less badly, than any other. It was probably intended therefore that Disampati and Reṇu were kings or chieftains in Benares. The king Bharata of the Sovīras of J. III, 470 may be the same as the Bharata who also appears in the table here as king of the Sovīras. The Reṇu of J. IV, 444 is king of the Kurus. None of the numerous Brahmādattas in the Jātakas can be identified with our Brahmādatta. Our Disampati and Reṇu are referred to, apparently as kings of Benares, at Dipavaɱsa III, 40.<br />
					The verses survived, but in a very corrupt state, down to the time of the Mahāvastu (Vol. III, p. 208, ed. Senart).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The expressions here are all elliptical, and it is not certain that the meanings supplied are quite right as the idioms <i>agghe pucchati</i> and <i>agghaɱ no karoti</i> do not occur elsewhere. The sequence of ideas would seem to be: 'Only such and such are fit to be offered as a mark of respect to so holy a deity. But not knowing which is best,	I	ask. Let the Holy One make it right.' Then the deity, who wants nothing, taking the will for the deed, says he accepts; and offers a boon.</p>
