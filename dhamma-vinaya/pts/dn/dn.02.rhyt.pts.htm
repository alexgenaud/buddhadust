					<h4 class="ctr c">Introduction To The Sāmañña-phala Sutta</h4>

					<p>The first Dialogue deals with the most fundamental conceptions that lay at the root of the Buddha's doctrine, his Dharma, his ethical and philosophical view of life - the second puts forth his justification for the foundation of the Order, for the enunciation of the Vinaya, the practical rules of canon law by which life in the Order is regulated. The Rules themselves are not discussed. It is only certain ethical precepts that are referred to in so many words. The question is a larger and wider one than the desirability of any particular injunction. It is as to the advantage, as to the use, of having any Order at all.</p>

					<p>King Ajātasattu of Magadha, after pointing out the advantages derived from their occupations by a long list of ordinary people in the world, asks whether the members of the Order, who have given up the world, derive any corresponding advantage, visible in this life, from theirs. The answer is a list of such advantages, arranged in an ascending scale of importance, each one mentioned being said to be better and sweeter than the one just before described.</p>

					<p>The list of ordinary occupations given in the question is interesting evidence, especially as compared with the later lists of a similar kind referred to in the notes, of social conditions in the Ganges valley at the time when this Dialogue was composed. And the introductory story, in which the king explains how he had put a similar question to the founders of six other orders, and gives the six replies he received, is interesting evidence of the views held by the authors of the Dialogue as to beliefs current at the time.</p>

					<p>The replies are no less interesting from the fact, pointed out by the king, that they are not to the point. Each of the six teachers goes off into a general statement of his theory instead of answering the question put. But as the works, if any, of all these teachers save one — Nigaṇṭha Nāta-putta have been irretrievably lost, the summary here given of their doctrines is of great importance as evidence of the sort of <a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> speculation they favoured. The six paragraphs are short and obscure, and this is just what we should expect. As is the case with the accounts given by early Catholic writers of opinions they held to be heretical, the versions of these six sets of belief are neither adequate nor clear. But a number of other references to these six theories are found, as pointed out in the notes, both in the Buddhist and in the Jain records. And it would be premature to discuss our six paragraphs until the whole of the available evidence is made accessible to scholars. It is noteworthy that in at least two of these answers some of the expressions used seem to be in a Prākrit differing in dialect from the Pāli of the <i>Piṭakas</i>. And these are not the only instances of the preservation in the <i>Piṭakas</i> of ancient dialectical varieties.</p>

					<p>The answer which the Buddha is represented to have given, in his turn, to the question raised by the king, takes (as is so often the case) the form of a counter-question. 'The very man whom, under ordinary circumstances, you would treat as slave or servant — what treatment would you mete out to him after he had joined an Order?' The king confesses that he would treat him as a person worthy of honour and respect. And neither in question nor answer is there any reference specially to the Buddhist Order. It is taken for granted, alike by the Buddha and the king, that any one who had devoted himself to the religious life, whatever the views or opinions he held, or the association he had joined, would, in accordance with the remarkable tolerance of that age and country, be treated with equal respect and courtesy. And the same note runs all through the Dialogue. The Buddha shows the advantages of the 'life of a recluse,' not necessarily of a follower of his own. And most of what he says would apply as much to his strongest opponents as to the members of his own Order.</p>

					<p>The following, in a constantly ascending order of merit, are the advantages, visible in this life, which he claims for such a recluse: —</p>

					<p>1. The honour and respect shown to a member of a religious order.</p>

					<p>2. The training in all those lower kinds of mere morality set out in the very ancient document called 'The Sīlas.' The importance of this document has been discussed above, in the Introduction to the Brahmajāla. The details of it may be summarised here as follows: -</p>

					<p>a. Mercy and kindness to all living things; § 43<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> b. Honesty.</p>

					<p>c. Chastity.</p>

					<p>d. Truthfulness, peacefulness, courtesy, and good sense in speech; §44.</p>

					<p>e. Abstinence from luxury of twelve different kinds, and freedom from trickery and violence; § 45.</p>

					<p>f. Not injuring plants; § 46.</p>

					<p>g. Not laying up treasure, of seven kinds; § 47.</p>

					<p>h. Not frequenting shows, of twenty-six specified kinds; §48.</p>

					<p>i. Not playing games, eighteen being mentioned by name; § 49.</p>

					<p>j. Not using luxurious rugs, etc., of twenty different kinds; § 50.</p>

					<p>k. Not using toilet luxuries, of which twenty-two are specified; § 51.</p>

					<p>l. Not talking vain things, of which twenty-seven instances are given; § 52.</p>

					<p>m. Not using sophistical and rude phrases when talking of higher things; § 53.</p>

					<p>n. Not acting as go-between; § 54.</p>

					<p>o. Not practising trickery and mystery under the guise of religion ; § 55</p>

					<p>p. Not gaining a living by low arts, such as auguries (§ 56);<br />
					advising as to the best sorts of various things (§ 57);<br />
					prophesying as to war and its results (§ 58); astrology (§ 59);<br />
					foretelling famine or plague or the reverse (§ 6o);<br />
					arranging marriages, using spells, or worshipping gods (§ 61);<br />
					various sorts of medical trickery (§ 62).</p>

					<p>3. The confidence of heart, absence of fear, resulting from the consciousness of right doing; § 63.</p>

					<p>4. The habit of keeping guarded the door of his senses; § 64.</p>

					<p>5. The constant self-possession he thus gains; § 65.</p>

					<p>6. The power of being content with little, with simplicity of life; § 66.</p>

					<p>7. The emancipation of heart from the Five Hindrances to self-mastery — covetousness, ill-temper, laziness, worry and flurry, and perplexity; §§ 68-74.</p>

					<p>8. The joy and peace that, as a result of the sense of this emancipation, fills his whole being; § 75.</p>

					<p><a id="pg59"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span></a> 9. The practice of the Four Jhānas; §§ 75-82.<sup><a id="fn2" href="#n2">[2]</a></sup></p>

					<p>10. The Insight arising from knowledge (ñāṇa-dassana); §§ 83, 84.</p>

					<p>11. The power of projecting mental images; §§ 85, 86.</p>

					<p>12. The five modes of mystic Insight (abhiññā); §§ 87-96</p>

					<p>a. The practice of Iddhi.</p>

					<p>b. The Heavenly Ear — hearing heavenly sounds.</p>

					<p>c. Knowledge of others' thoughts.</p>

					<p>d. Memory of his own previous births.</p>

					<p>e. Knowledge of other people's previous births (the Heavenly Eye).</p>

					<p>13. The realisation of the Four Truths, the destruction of the āsavas, and attainment of Arahatship; §§ 97, 98.</p>

					<p>Now it is perfectly true that of these thirteen consecutive propositions, or groups of propositions, it is only the last, No. 13, which is exclusively Buddhist. But the things omitted, the union of the whole of those included into one system, the order in which the ideas are arranged, the way in which they are treated as so many steps of a ladder whose chief value depends on the fact that it leads up to the culminating point of Nirvāṇa in Arahatship — all this is also distinctively Buddhist. And further, the whole statement, the details of it, the order of it, must have soaked very thoroughly into the minds of the early Buddhists. For we find the whole, or nearly the whole, of it repeated (with direct reference by name to our Sutta as the oldest and most complete enumeration of it) not only in all the subsequent dialogues translated in this volume, but also in many others.</p>

					<p>In these repetitions the order is always the same, and the details (so far as they occur) are the same. But one or other of the thirteen groups is often omitted, and the application of those of them that remain is always different — that is to say, they are enumerated in support, or in illustration, of a different proposition.</p>

					<p>A comparison of some of these other applications of the list is full of suggestion as to its real meaning here.</p>

					<p>In the Ambaṭṭha the point is as to caste. The Kshatriya caste is the most honourable, but wisdom and conduct are higher still. What then is the right conduct, what the right <a id="pg60"><span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span></a> wisdom? The conduct (caraṇa) is all the above paragraphs from 2-9 inclusive; the wisdom (vijjā) is the rest, 10-13.<sup><a id="fn3" href="#n3">[3]</a></sup></p>

					<p>In the Soṇadaṇḍa the question is : What is the true Brahman?' After, by his usual Socratic method, leading Soṇadaṇḍa to acknowledge that the only two essential requisites are goodness and intelligence, these last are explained as above (2-9 and 10-13).</p>

					<p>In the Kūṭadanta the question is as to the right sort of sacrifice. After rejecting animal sacrifice we have generosity (of various kinds, each better than the last), faith, training in the precepts, and 2-13, set forth as each of them a better sacrifice than the last.</p>

					<p>In the Gāliya the question is whether the soul is the same as, or is other than, the body. The answer is a counter question. Repeating our sections 2-13 (omitting 11 and 12) the Buddha asks, at the end of each subdivision, whether men who do that would be likely to trouble themselves as to speculations about the soul? And the answer being, of course, 'No,' rejoins that neither does he.</p>

					<p>In the Poṭṭhapāda the question is as to the way in which various recluses attain to mystic trance. The Buddha's answer is that it is by training; and the training should be first in morals (our groups 2 and 3) then in the things mentioned in our groups 4-9, and then in the Four Arūpa Vimokkhas. The Dialogue then takes up other questions, omitting our groups 10-13.</p>

					<p>In the Kevaḍḍha the talk is on miracles, mystic powers. And the Buddha, disparaging all others, calls attention to our groups 2-13.</p>

					<p>In the Lohikka the question is as to who is the right sort of teacher; and the answer is that it is the one whose pupil carries out our groups 2-13.</p>

					<p>In the Tevijja the question is as to the way by which one can attain to union with God (Brahmā-sahavyatā). The answer gives our groups 1-8, and then adds the Four Brahma-vihāras.</p>

					<p>In the shorter of the two Hatthipadopama Suttas <a id="pg61"><span class="f2 g"><b>[61]</b></span></a> (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p27">No. 27</a> in the Majjhima), the question discussed between a Brahman and an ascetic is as to the ascendancy of the Buddha over the other teachers of the time. The Buddha himself giving afterwards the full reason, repeats our group 2 (omitting however clauses f to p inclusive <sup><a id="fn4" href="#n4">[4]</a></sup>), then repeats our groups 6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) then omitting groups 10 and 11, quotes two only, the last two (omitting the first three) <sup><a id="fn5" href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> of the five Abhiññās in group 12, and concludes with group 13 in full.</p>

					<p>In the Mahā Taṇhā-saṇkhaya Sutta (No. 38 in the Majjhima), we have the same sequence — our group 2 (omitting f to p), then 6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The rest is omitted.</p>

					<p>In the next Sutta, the longer of the Assapuras, after a summary in different words of most of the contents of our group 2, we have our group 45 then two paragraphs not in our Sutta, then our groups 5, 7, 8, 9, and the last two only out of group 12, and then (as a climax) our group 13 - all enumerated to show what is the true Brahman, the true samaṇa.</p>

					<p>Then again in the Sakuludāyi, No. 79 of the Majjhima, it is declared to be not for the sake of realising happiness that recluses take up the celibate life in the Order under the Buddha, but for the sake of those matters set forth in our groups 2-9 inclusive <sup><a id="fn6" href="#n6">[6]</a></sup>, of the two last of the Abhiññās, and above all for the sake of the attainment of Arahatship.</p>

					<p>Besides the differences pointed out above between the Suttas preserved in the Dīgha, and in the Majjhima, respectively — differences due, I think, solely to the difference in the subjects under discussion — there are also a few verbal differences, amounting to scarcely more than 'various readings,' due, perhaps, to the divergent traditions of the Dīgha bhāṇakā and the Majjhima-bhāṇakā (the students and repeaters of the two collections in which the Dialogues are handed down to us).</p>

					<p>However this may be, it is clear that the sum and the sequence of the paragraphs in our Sutta is regarded as of <a id="pg62"><span class="f2 g"><b>[62]</b></span></a> great importance, not as a statement of Buddhist ethics, or of Buddhist philosophy, or of the Buddhist religion, but as a statement of the advantages that may be looked for as the result of life in an Order. And further that the statement has to be slightly modified and shortened when the question is the narrower one of life in the particular community which we call the Buddhist Order.</p>

					<p>The difference is interesting — in the scheme for the Buddhist Order the ñāṇa-dassana, the power of projecting a mental image (apparently of oneself, which seems like the earliest germ of the modern Yoga ideas about, the astral body), the powers of Iddhi, the power of hearing heavenly sounds (something like hearing the music of the spheres), and the power of knowing the thoughts of others, are all omitted.</p>

					<p>In the abstract given above, I have called these last three, together with the power of calling to mind one's own, and other peoples', previous births, the Five Abhiññās, or Intuitions. And this is in accord with the passages on which Childers's article <i>sub voce</i> is based. But these powers are not so called either in our text, or in any other Dialogue yet published. The use of the word abhiññā in this technical sense would seem therefore (to judge from the published texts) to be a sign of the later date of the book in which it occurs.<sup><a id="fn7" href="#n7">[7]</a></sup> In the oldest portions of the <i>Piṭakas</i> the word is always used in the general sense of insight, and if any special limitation is hinted at, it is simply the insight of Arahatship that is emphasised (as in Dhammapada 423, which is a quotation from Itivuttaka, No. 99, and is quoted also at Aṇguttara I, 165 )<sup><a id="fn8" href="#n8">[8]</a></sup></p>

					<p>The Eightfold Path is not mentioned in our Sutta. This is not merely because it is not possible always to mention <a id="pg63"><span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span></a> everything. The Path does not come within the special advantages of life in the Order. To enter upon the Path to Arahatship, to walk along it, is not peculiar to members of the Order. A bhikshu might reach the goal either along that path, open also to laymen<sup><a id="fn9" href="#n9">[9]</a></sup>, or by the process set out in our Sutta. They are two quite distinct methods of training, of which our Sutta deals only with one.</p>

					<p>It is essential, in order to understand Buddhist ethics. to bear in mind that there are (and must be in such a system) several different lines along which both speculation and edifying teaching run. These are:</p>

					<p>1. The course of conduct laid down for the ordinary Buddhist layman, contained in the Gahapati — vaggas found in the various nikāyas<sup><a id="fn10" href="#n10">[10]</a></sup></p>

					<p>2. The rules as to the outward conduct of the members of the Order, laid down in the Pāṭimokkha and in the Khandhakas<sup><a id="fn11" href="#n11">[11]</a></sup></p>

					<p>3. The system of self-training in higher things prescribed for members of the Order. Of this our present Sutta is a striking example.</p>

					<p>4. The method of self-training laid down for those who have entered upon the Path to Arahatship. (The Four Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the āsavas.)</p>

					<p>In the first of these Buddhism goes very little beyond the current ethics of the day. In the second a very great deal has been simply incorporated from the rules found expedient by previous recluses, both Brahman and non-Brahman, though there are numerous differences, both of the positive regulations included, and also of things deliberately omitted. Even the third, as we have seen, cannot be considered, except in a very limited sense, as exclusively Buddhist. It is in the fourth that the essential doctrines of Buddhism are to be found. All four have, no doubt, become welded together into a more or less consistent whole. But to understand the whole, the relation of its various parts has to be kept constantly in view.</p>

					<p>This will explain an apparent contradiction. The last Sutta quoted, the Sakuludāyi, states that the aim of the religious or celibate life as led in the Buddha's Order, is the attainment, in order, of the various things set out in our Sutta (groups 2-9, 12 and 13).</p>

					<p><a id="pg64"><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></a> Now in other passages other things are stated to be the aim.</p>

					<p>Thus in the Saṃyutta (IV, 51) the Buddha himself is represented as explaining that the celibate life (the brahmacariyā)<sup><a id="fn12" href="#n12">[12]</a></sup> is led by his followers for the sake of the complete understanding of pain(dukkha-pariññā). Further on in the same book (VI, 253 = V, 6, 27) this is three times repeated, with the suggestive addition that there is one way to this, to wit, the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

					<p>Again, in the Aṇguttara (IV, 7) the higher life is said to be for the sake of getting rid of, of cutting, through, seven Bonds which prevent one from attaining Arahatship. The argument on pp. 88, 99 (though the word brahma-carinyā does not occur) comes to much the same thing. And further on in the same book (IV, 272) the object is stated to be for the sake of getting rid of five particular sorts of envy.</p>

					<p>Nāgasena is therefore quite right when he says that the object of renouncing the world to live in the Order is for the sake of righteousness and peace<sup><a id="fn13" href="#n13">[13]</a></sup>; and in another place that it is to the end that sorrow may pass away<sup><a id="fn14" href="#n14">[14]</a></sup>. All these explanations belong to the Path, not to the rules of the Order. They are not really inconsistent with the other aim that our Sutta sets out. And they are only additional proof, if such were needed, that it is no more possible to sum up in a single phrase (as some writers have tried to do) the aim of Buddhism, or the object of life in the Order, than it would be to sum up in a similar way the aim of Christianity, or the object for which men enter a Christian Order. The aims are necessarily as various as the character and circumstances of the various individuals who take them up. And Nāgasena does not hesitate to add — and to add in speaking to a king — that some had joined the Order in terror at the tyranny of kings, some in fear of robbers, some because they were harassed by debt, and some perhaps merely to gain a livelihood.</p>

					<p>This also would apply to other Orders both in India and elsewhere, and is quite consistent with our Sutta, which only purports to set forth the advantages the early Buddhists held to be the likely results of joining, from whatever motive, such an Order as their own.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Details a-d (though the fact is not referred to here) are the opposites of 'the three bad acts of the body, and the four bad acts of speech, <i>kāya-</i> and <i>vacī- duccaritāni,</i> so often referred to in the Suttas, and in the Abhidhamma. The three others (of the mind), making up the ten given in my manual, p. 142, are omitted here because they belong to the higher morality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Buddhaghosa (p. 219) says that though the Four Arūpa Vimokkhas are not explicitly mentioned they are to be understood (thus making up the Eight Samāpattis). This may be so: but it looks like a later writer reading his own opinion into the older text. They are put into the text at Poṭṭhapāda, pp. 183, 184, and it is difficult to see why they should not have been also inserted here, if they were really implied.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Possibly Nos. 11 and 12 are meant, both here and in all the other Suttas, to be omitted. The wording is ambiguous. Buddhaghosa, who talks here (see p. 268) of Nos. 10-13 as the Eightfold <i>paññā,</i> apparently means to include them (he could not otherwise get eight). But the argument of the Mahāli seems to exclude them. The texts always jump from the last words of 10 to the last words of 13. Now as in the Mahāli No. 12 is excluded, it is clear that at least there only Nos. 10 and 13 are meant. And there is no difference between the phraseology in the Mahāli and that used in the other Suttas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> From which we may infer that, as respects those matters, he saw no difference between himself and the other teachers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> So that the power of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm"><i>Iddhi,</i></a> of hearing heavenly sounds and of knowing other people's thoughts, are apparently supposed to be in common ground between the buddhists and the other sects, they are included in our sutta because they are supposed to be part of the advantage of life in an Order — in any Order, that is, not only the Buddhist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> The oldest case of the technical use of the word, so far as I know, is in the introductory story of the Mahā Vibhaṇga on the fourth Pārājika (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm">Vin.</a> III, 87).

I have not thought it necessary to point out the numerous passages, occurring indeed in nearly every sentence, in which the present translation differs from theirs. It should be mentioned here, however, that Burnouf has missed the whole point of the dialogue by misunderstanding the constantly repeated phrase <i>sandiṭṭhikaṃ sāmañña-phalaṃ.</i> from which this title is taken. He renders it throughout as meaning 'foreseen and general fruit' which is grammatically impossible as regards <i>sandiṭṭhikaṃ,</i> and rests on a false derivation as regards <i>sāmañña.</i> This last word means, of course, '<i>samaṇa</i>ship, being a <i>samaṇa,</i> living as a <i>samaṇa,</i> a recluse, a religieux.'</p>

But see the note at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya Texts',</i></a> II, 174 ; which shows that the more likely meaning is 'the bringer-up of children' (child-doctor). Several cures, however, wrought by him are recorded; and the patients are always adults.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n18" href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup> This is interesting, as it shows that the year, for the compilers of our Sutta, began in Sāvana (middle of July to middle of August), that is, with the rainy season. There were three Uposatha days in each month, on the 7th, 14th, and 15th day of the month.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n22" href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> Burnouf has made a sad mess of this important and constantly repeated clause. He has 'Is it then possible, Sir, that one should declare to them (that is, to the craftsmen just mentioned) in this world, such a result (of their actions) as foreseen and as the general fruit of their conduct?' But the king asks the Buddha to tell him (the king himself) whether the members of the Order derive from their life any benefit corresponding to that which the craftsmen derive from theirs.</p>

They are frequently used in the same order in the Jaina-Sūtras, and Professor Jacobi renders them accordingly 'Every sentient being, every insect, every living thing, whether animal or vegetable.'

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n29" href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup> Buddhaghosa gives the details 'babyhood, playtime, trial time, erect time, learning time, ascetic time, prophet time, and prostrate time' with (very necessary) comments on each. One may compare Shakespeare's 'Seven Ages of Man.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n30" href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup> <i>ājīva.</i> The Siamese edition reads <i>ājīvaka.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n32" href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> This answer recurs <i>S.</i> III, 307, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg515"><i>M.</i> I, 515</a> (compare Dh.S. 1215, 1362, 1364), as the view of a typical sophist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n33" href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> <i>Samma-g-gato.</i> Buddhaghosa gives here no explanation of this word, but the Jātaka Commentary on <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_391"><i>Jāt.</i> III, 305</a> says it means the man who has attained the highest fruit; that is, Arahatship. <i>Gato</i> is used here in the same sense as it has in <i>Tathāgato,</i> in <i>gatatto</i> (in the Nigaṇṭha paragraph below), and in <i>vijjā-gato</i> (<i>S.N.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v730">730,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v733">733,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v743">743</a>), that is, who has not only attempted to go to, but has actually reached, the aim (common alike to the orthodox Vedāntist Brahmans and to each of the various schools of independent, dissenting, thinkers and recluses) of the conquest over ignorance, of the grasp of truth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n34" href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/indriyani.htm"><i>Indriyāni,</i></a> the five senses, and the mind as a sixth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n35" href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup><i>Ahutiyo.</i> See Buddhavaṃsa XXVII, 10; Kathā Vatthu 550. The phrase is omitted in the parallel passage in the Jaina 'Sūtrakritānga' pointed out by Jacobi, 'Jaina-Sūtras,' II, xxiv.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n36" href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup> The series of riddles in this difficult passage is probably intended to be an ironical imitation of the Nigaṇṭha's way of talking. Gogerly has caught the general sense fairly enough, but his version is very free, and wrong as to two of the words, and it gives no idea of the oracular form in which the original is couched. Burnouf's rendering is quite wide of the mark.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first of the 'Four Restraints' is the well-known rule of the Jains not to drink cold water, on the ground that there are 'souls' in it. See the discussion in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm"><i>Milinnda</I></a> (11, 91 of my translation).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Professor Jacobi ('Jaina-Sūtras,' II, xxiii) thinks the 'Four Restraints' are intended to represent the four vows kept by the followers of Parsva. But this surely cannot be so, for these vows were quite different.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n37" href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup> The text repeats the whole paragraph put above (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#pg27">p. 27</a> of the text) into the mouth of the Eel-wriggler.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n38" href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> Of these six teachers Pūraṇa denies the evil Karma in a bad act and vice versa; Ajita, in preaching annihilation at death, shuts out the possibility of any effect to be worked by Karma; and Makkhali rejects both Karma and its effect. The theory of Pakudha seems to exclude responsibility; the Nigaṇṭha simply begs the question, by asserting that a Nigaṇṭha has attained the end; and Saṇjaya gives no answer at all.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The only one of these six theories of life on which independent evidence is at present accessible is that of the Nigaṇṭha (the Jain theory). But no attempt has yet been made to summarise it, or set it out in a manner intelligible to Western readers. It is very much to be hoped that this want may soon be supplied by one or other of the excellent scholars familiar, with the texts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n39" href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup> Buddhaghosa applies these last two adjectives to the truth, not to the life. But it seems more in accord with the next paragraph to refer them to the life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n40" href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup> <i>Gahapati,</i> which Buddhaghosa takes here in the sense of peasant <i>ryot</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n41" href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> <i>Pāṭimokkha-saṇvara-saṇvuto.</i> Buddhaghosa, I think, takes this to mean 'restrained according to the rules of the Pāṭimokkha.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n42" href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup> On the following important and constantly repeated paragraph compare M. I, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.027.pali.bd.htm#pg180">180,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.038.pali.bd.htm#pg268">268;</a> K.V. 424-6, 463-4; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm">Mil.</a> 367; Asl. 400, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n43" href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup> <i>Na nimittaggāhī hoti nānuvyaāganaggāhī.</i> The phrase <i>nimittaṃ gaṇhāti</i> means either to seize upon anything as the object of one's thought to the exclusion of everything else (see, for instance, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm">Vin.</a> I, 183, and Buddhaghosa's note on it given in the (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya Texts,'</i></a> II, 9), or to seize upon the outward sign of anything so keenly as to recognise what it is the mark of (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm">Vin.</a> III, 17). And when the object is a person of the other sex this phrase is the idiom used for our 'falling in love with.' Buddhaghosa gives, as an instance of the <i>nimitta,</i> the general conclusion that the object seen, heard, etc., is a man or woman; of the <i>anuvyaājana,</i> the perception of the detail that he or she is smiling, talking, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n44" href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> <i>Avyāseka,</i> literally 'with no besprinkling' (of evil, says Buddhaghosa).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n45" href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup> A small volume might be written on the various expansions of this text in the <i>Piṭakas</i>. Several whole Dialogues are devoted to it, and various Suttas in others of the oldest texts. Buddhaghosa has many pages upon it here, and deals with it also at length in the <i>Visuddhi Magga</i> and elsewhere. What is above added in brackets [removed to note <a href="#edn1">edn1</a>] explains the principal points of what is implied, according to the <i>Piṭakas,</i> in this famous passage, — the Buddhist analogue to St. Paul's: <i>'Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God'</i> (I Cor. x. 31).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">By the real fact underlying any action is meant that, in the Buddhist theory, behind the action (going, seeing, etc.) there is no ego, no actor (goer, seer, etc.), that can be called a 'soul' <i>(Abbhantare attā nāma āloketā vā viloketā vā n' atthi),</i> but that there is a psychological explanation sufficient, of itself, without the soul-theory.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n46" href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup> <i>'Consider the fowls of the air,'</i> etc. (Matt. vi. 26).<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man can call me servant, and I wander —<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said the Exalted One —<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At will, o'er all the earth, on what I find<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel no need of wages, or of gain,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let the rain pour down now, if it likes, tonight.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#I.2">(Dhaniya Sutta 8.)</a> and see the context in my 'American Lectures,' p. 168.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n47" href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> <i>Abhijjhaṃ loke pahāya.</i> Gogerly renders 'banishes desire from him,' leaving out <i>loke</i> altogether, and rendering <i>abhijjhā</i> in defiance both of the derivation and of the traditional explanation of the word. Even Burnouf (who frequently uses 'desire' for words in the Pāli meaning 'lusts' or 'excitement') has here 'cupidity'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n48" href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> So Buddhaghosa here (p.211). But the Dhamma Sangaṇi II 56, II 57 explains it as torpor of mind and body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n49" href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup> <i>āloka-saññī,</i> literally 'whose ideas are light.' Neumann (Reden des Gotamo,' 1, 434, etc.) translates 'loving the light,' which may be the right connotation. Burnouf has 'being aware of his visual sensation' <i>(de son regard),</i> which is certainly wrong.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n50" href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup> <i>Iṇaṃ ādāya.</i> Neumann has 'oppressed by debt,' but Buddhaghosa (p. 212) says 'taking goods on interest'; and this is confirmed by Jāt. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_482">IV, 256,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_536">V, 436.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n51" href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup> From the beginning of § 68 the text, though here split up into paragraphs for the convenience of the reader, is really one long sentence or paragraph of much eloquence and force in the Pāli; and the peroration, leading on to the <i>Jhānas,</i> is a favourite passage recurring <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.012.pali.bd.htm#pg71"><i>M.</i> I, 71;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm">Vin.</a> I, 294; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm">Mil.</a> 84. The five similes are to be taken, in order, as referring to the <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/nivarana.htm">Five Hindrances <i>(Nīvaraṇā)</i></a> given in § 68. The Dhamma Sangaṇi 1152 gives six hindrances, and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg360"><i>M.</i> 1, 360-3</a> gives eight.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n52" href="#fn52">[52]</a></sup> <i>Viveka,</i> 'separation' — physically of the body, 'seclusion'; intellectually, of the objects of thought, 'discrimination'; ethically, of the heart, 'being separate from the world.' We have no word in English suggesting these three. all of which are implied. The stress is upon separation from the world, taking 'world' in the sense of all the hindrances to spiritual progress, and especially of the five chief hindrances <i>(Nīvaraṇā)</i> just above set out. Buddhaghosa has nothing here, but compare Asl. 166.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n53" href="#fn53">[53]</a></sup> <i>Ekodibhāva.</i> Compare Asl. 169, Senart in Mahāvastu I, 554, and the notes in <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1884_i.pdf"><i>J.P.T.S., 1884</i>,</a> P. 32 foll.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n54" href="#fn54">[54]</a></sup> <i>Upekhako,</i> literally 'looking on,' that is, looking on rival mental states with equal mind. Imperturbable, impartial, tolerant, unsusceptible, stoical, composed, are all possible renderings, and all unsatisfactory. The ten kinds of <i>Upekkhā,</i> 'equanimity,' translated into English from Sinhalese by Spence Hardy (Manual, p. 505), can now be corrected from the Pāli at Asl. 172.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n55" href="#fn55">[55]</a></sup> This is a favourite description of the body. (See <i>M.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.074.pali.bd.htm#pg500">I, 500;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg17">II, 17;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.103.pali.bd.htm"><i>S.</i> IV, 83;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_12"><i>Jāt.</i> I, 146,</a> etc.) The words for erasion, abrasion, are cunningly chosen <i>(ucchādana, parimaddana).</i> They are also familiar technical terms of the Indian shampooer, and are so used above (P. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#p16">7, § 16</a> of the text). The double meaning must have been clearly present to the Indian hearer, and the words are, therefore, really untranslatable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n56" href="#fn56">[56]</a></sup> <i>Viññāṇa.</i> 'The five senses, sensations arising from objects, and all emotions and intellectual processes,' says Buddhaghosa (P. 221).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n57" href="#fn57">[57]</a></sup> In spite of this and similar passages the adherents of the soul theory (having nothing else to fasten on) were apt to fasten on to the Buddhist <i>Viññāṇa</i> as a possible point of reconciliation with their own theory. Even an admirer of the Buddha (one Sāti, a member of the Order) went so far as to tell the Buddha himself that he must, as he admitted transmigration, have meant that the <i>Viññāṇa</i> did not really depend upon, was not really bound, up with, the body, but that it formed the link in transmigration. In perhaps the most earnest and emphatic of all the <i>Dialogues</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.038.pali.bd.htm">(<i>M.</i> I, 256 foll.),</a> the Buddha meets and refutes at length this erroneous representation of his view. But it still survives. I know two living writers on Buddhism who (in blissful ignorance of the Dialogue in question) still fasten upon Buddha the opinion he so expressly refused to accept.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n58" href="#fn58">[58]</a></sup> Buddhaghosa explains that, if the Bhikshu have his ears unpierced, so will the image, and so on.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n59" href="#fn59">[59]</a></sup> This old smile occurs already in the Satapatha-Brāhmaṇa IV, 3, 3, 16</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n60" href="#fn60">[60]</a></sup> The point is the similarity. Buddhaghosa explains that the <i>Karaṇḍa</i> is not a basket (as Burnouf renders it), but the skin which the snake sloughs off; and that the scabbard is like the sword, whatever the sword's shape. He adds that of course a man could not take a snake out of its slough with his hand. He is supposed in the simile to do so in imagination.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n61" href="#fn61">[61]</a></sup> <i>Iddhi,</i> literally 'well-being, prosperity.'

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n62" href="#fn62">[62]</a></sup> The point of the comparison, says Buddhaghosa (223), is that if he is in trouble and has lost his way he might be in doubt. But if calm and secure he can tell the difference.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n64" href="#fn64">[64]</a></sup> This is based on the Indian theory of the periodic destruction and renovation of the universe, each of which takes countless years to accomplish.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n66" href="#fn66">[66]</a></sup> The three villages correspond to the three stages of being, the three <i>Bhūmis,</i> - the world of lust, the world of form, and the formless worlds (the <i>Kāma, Rūpa,</i> and <i>Arūpa</i> Lokas).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n67" href="#fn67">[67]</a></sup> <i>Dibba-cakkhu.</i> See the note below on <a href="#p102">§ 102</a> at the end of this Sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n68" href="#fn68">[68]</a></sup> This paragraph forms the subject of the discussion in the <i>Kathā Vatthu</i> III, 9 (p. 250). The mere knowledge of the general fact of the action of <i>Karma</i> is there distinguished from the <i>Dibba-cakkhu,</i> the Heavenly Eye; and the instance of Sāriputta is quoted, who had that knowledge, but not the Heavenly Eye. As he was an Arahat it follows that the possession of the Heavenly Eye was not a necessary consequence of Arahatship. Buddhaghosa adds (p. 224) that the sphere of vision of the Heavenly Eye did not extend to the Formless Worlds. On the <i>Dhamma-cakkhu,</i> 'the Eye for the Truth.,' see below, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.03.pali.bd.htm#pg110">p. 110, § 21</a> of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n69" href="#fn69">[69]</a></sup> <i>Vītisañkarante</i> is Buddhaghosa's reading. The Siamese has <i>Vithiṃ.</i> Compare <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.039.pali.bd.htm#pg279"><i>M.</i> I, 279.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n70" href="#fn70">[70]</a></sup> <i>āsavas,</i> Deadly Floods, another untranslatable term. Neumann has Illusion (Wahn); Burnouf has defilement <i>(souillures).</i> They are sometimes the three here mentioned (<i>M.</i> I, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.004.pali.bd.htm#pg23">23,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.025.pali.bd.htm#pg155">155;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.059.pali.bd.htm#pg167"><i>A.</i> I, 167;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.38.008.pali.bd.htm"><i>S.</i> IV, 256,</a> etc.); but speculation, theorising <i>(Diṭṭhi)</i> is added as a fourth in the M.P.S. and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the word has not been yet found in its concrete, primary, sense; unless indeed Buddhaghosa's statement (at Asl. 48) that well-seasoned spirituous liquors were called āsavā be taken literally. It is therefore impossible to be sure what is the simile that underlies the use of the word in its secondary, ethical sense. Perhaps after all it is the idea of overwhelming intoxication, and not of flood or taint or ooze, that we ought to consider.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Subhūti in quoting the above passage from Buddhaghosa (in the Abhidhāna Padīpikā Sūci, P. 43) reads <i>pārivās</i> throughout for <i>pārivās</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n71" href="#fn71">[71]</a></sup> <i>Kamāsavā,</i> with special reference to the taint of hankering after a future life in the sensuous plane <i>(Kāma Loka);</i> that is, in the world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n72" href="#fn72">[72]</a></sup> <i>Bhavāsavā,</i> with special reference to the taint of hankering after a future life in the plane of form and the formless plane (the <i>Rūpa</i> and <i>Arūpa Lokas</i>); that is, in heaven.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n73" href="#fn73">[73]</a></sup> <i>Avijjāsavā,</i> with special reference to ignorance of the Four Great Truths, just above summarised.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n74" href="#fn74">[74]</a></sup> The simile recurs <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.043.pali.bd.htm#pg297"><i>M.</i> I, 279;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/01_ones/an01.001-097.pali.bd.htm#pg9"><i>A.</i> I, 9.</a> Compare for the words <i>sippi-sambuka</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_526"><i>Jāt.</i> V, 197;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/06_sixes/an06.060.pali.bd.htm#pg395"><i>A.</i> III, 395;</a> Trenckner, <i>'Pali Miscellany,'</i> p. 6o.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n75" href="#fn75">[75]</a></sup> Because, as Buddhaghosa points out, this is really Arahatship, Nirvāṇa; and it was to this, to Arahatship, that all the rest led up.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup><a id="n77" href="#fn77">[77]</a></sup> The <i>Dhamma-cakkhu</i> (Eye for the Truth) is a technical term for conversion, for entering on the Path that ends in Arahatship. It is higher than the Heavenly Eye (<i>dibba-cakkhu,</i> above, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.02.pali.bd.htm#pg82">p.82</a> of the text, § 95) which sees other people's previous births, and below the Eye of Wisdom <i>(paññā-cakkhu)</i> which is the wisdom of the Arahat <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p61">(<i>Itivuttaka,</i> p. 52, § 6i).</a></p>
