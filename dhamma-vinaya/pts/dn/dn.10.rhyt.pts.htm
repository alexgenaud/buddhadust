					<h4>Introduction to the Subha Sutta.</h4>

					<p>As this Sutta is almost word for word the same as the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2"><i>Sāmañña-phala,</i></a> the question arises why it was considered advisable to include it in our collection as a separate Sutta. The chief difference is that the states of mind enumerated in the <i>Sāmañña-phala</i> as fruits of the life of a recluse are here divided under the three heads of <i>Sīla, Samādhi,</i> and <i>Paññā</i> (Conduct, Concentration, and Intelligence).</p>

					<p><i>Samādhi</i> has not yet been found in any Indian book older than the <i>Piṭakas.</i> And, as in them, it is used exclusively of a mental state, never in a concrete sense, its meaning is not easy to fix exactly. It is not the same as <i>Jhāna,</i> which is a pre-Buddhistic term applied to four special forms of meditation, culminating in self-induced ecstasy. <i>Samādhi</i> on the other hand is a constant habit, or faculty, of mind. The oldest Sanskrit text in which it occurs is the <i>Maitri Upanishad;</i> and it probably has there the same meaning as it has in the <i>Piṭakas.</i></p>

					<p>In our present Sutta — and the principal reason for its existence as a separate Sutta is that it points out just this — it is pointed out that Samādhi includes, it is true, the <i>Jhānas,</i> but also other, and very different things. These are the habit of guarding the doors of one's senses; constant mindfulness and self-possession; and the faculty of being content with little. From the negative point of view it is said to include emancipation from ill-temper, inertness of mind and body, worry, and perplexity; from the positive point of view it is said to include a constant state of joy and peace.</p>

					<p>Wilson's Sanskrit Dictionary (1819) gives the meaning 'devout meditation'; and the rendering 'meditation' has been used for it in subsequent works in English by Western scholars. It is quite clear that this would be a very inadequate and misleading rendering in our Sutta. But exigencies of space preclude the discussion here, either of the meaning, or of the very interesting and suggestive history of the word in India.</p>

					<p><a id="pg266"><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></a> How far was the word (literally 'allocation') invented or adopted by the Buddhists, or by their immediate spiritual forerunners, to express 'self-concentration' with implied co-ordination, harmonisation, of the mental faculties — an idea they wanted, in the statement of their most essential and ethical doctrines, to be used in preference to the more limited, more physical, notion of <i>Jhāna?</i> (It is <i>Samādhi,</i> and not <i>Jhāna</i> that we find in the Four Truths, in the Noble Path, and in the thirty-seven constituent parts of Arahatship.) How far, through the constant association of the two ideas, did the larger, as ethical feeling died away, become swallowed up by the smaller? At what date, in what circles, and under what reservations, did the word <i>Samādhi</i> come to mean nothing more than meditation? The history of the two ideas, <i>Samādhi</i> and <i>Jhāna,</i> has constant analogies with the history of the two similarly related ideas of <i>Tāpasa</i> and <i>Bhikshu,</i> and, like it, is of the first importance in following the evolution of philosophical and religious thought in India.</p>

					<p>I have made some detailed contributions to the discussion of such questions in my <i>'Yogāvacara Manual'</i> (<i>Pāli Text Society,</i> 1896, pp. xiv-xxviii); and must confine myself, here, to referring to those pages.</p>

					<h1>Conduct, Concentration, and Intellect</h1>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.10.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I <span class="f2"><b>HEARD</b></span>. The venerable Ānanda was once staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi</a><br />
					in the Jeta Wood,<br />
					in Anātha Piṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					shortly after the Exalted One had died away.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the young Brahman Subha,<br />
					the son of the man of Tudi,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was dwelling at Sāvatthi<br />
					on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now Subha, the young Brahman,<br />
					addressed a certain young man,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come now, young man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go to the Samaṇa Ānanda,<br />
					and ask in my name<br />
					as to whether his sickness and indisposition has abated,<br />
					as to his health and vigour<br />
					and condition of ease;<br />
					and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Twere well if the venerable Ānanda<br />
					would be so kind as to pay a visit<br />
					to Subha, the young Brahman,<br />
					the son of the man of Tudi.'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Very well, Sir,"<br />
					said that young man in reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went to the place<br />
					where the venerable Ānanda was staying,<br />
					and exchanged with him<br />
					the greetings and compliments<br />
					of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and took his seat apart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, so seated,<br />
					he delivered to the venerable Ānanda<br />
					the message with which he had been charged.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><span class="f3"><b>[205]</b></span></span> 4. On hearing that message,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not just now, young man, convenient,<br />
					for I have just taken medicine.</p>

					<p class="f4">But perhaps I may be able to go on the morrow,<br />
					if so be that conditions and opportunity seem fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that young man arose from his seat,<br />
					and went to Subha,<br />
					and told him all,<br />
					and added:</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, Sir, the matter has been so far accomplished<br />
					that perhaps the venerable Ānanda<br />
					may be able to come on the morrow,<br />
					if so be that conditions and opportunity seem fit."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> 5. And the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					when the night had passed away,<br />
					dressed himself early in the morning,<br />
					and went, in his robes and carrying his bowl,<br />
					with a Bhikkhu from the Cetiya country as his attendant,<br />
					to Subha's house,<br />
					and took his seat on the mat spread out for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Subha, the young Brahman,<br />
					the son of the man of Tudi,<br />
					came there where he sat,<br />
					and exchanged with the venerable Ānanda<br />
					the greetings and compliments<br />
					of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, so seated,<br />
					he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You, Sir, have waited long<br />
					on the venerable Gotama,<br />
					constantly near him,<br />
					continually in his company.</p>

					<p class="f4">You, Sir, will know<br />
					what were the things<br />
					the venerable Gotama was wont to praise;<br />
					to which he used to incite the folk,<br />
					in which he established them,<br />
					and made them firm.</p>

					<p class="f4">What were they, Ānanda?"</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "Three are the bodies of doctrine, young Brahman,<br />
					which the Exalted One was wont to praise;<br />
					to which he used to incite the folk,<br />
					in which he established them,<br />
					and made them firm.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The so noble body of doctrine<br />
					regarding right conduct,<br />
					the so noble body of doctrine<br />
					regarding self-concentration,<br />
					the so noble body of doctrine<br />
					regarding intelligence."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, Ānanda,<br />
					is this so noble body of doctrine<br />
					regarding right conduct<br />
					<i>(Sīla)</i><br />
					in praise of which<br />
					the venerable Gotama was wont to speak;<br />
					to which he used to incite the folk,<br />
					in which he established them,<br />
					and made them firm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, young Brahman,<br />
					there appears in the world<br />
					one who has won the truth, an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy,<br />
					who knows all worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One,<br />
					a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face this universe,<br />
					— including the worlds above of the gods,<br />
					the Brahmas, and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples, —<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />
					doth he proclaim,<br />
					both in the spirit and in the letter,<br />
					the higher life doth he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or one of his children,<br />
					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the Tathāgata (the one who has found the truth);<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has thus become a recluse<br />
					he lives self-restrained by that restraint that should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight,<br />
					and he sees danger<br />
					in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure are his means of livelihood,<br />
					good is his conduct,<br />
					guarded the doors of his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he is altogether happy.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, young Brahman, is his conduct good?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this, young Brahman, that the Bhikshu,<br />
					putting away the killing of living things,<br />
					holds aloof from the destruction of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The cudgel and the sword he has laid aside,<br />
					and ashamed of roughness,<br />
					and full of mercy,<br />
					he dwells compassionate and kind<br />
					to all creatures that have life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the taking<br />
					of what has not been given,<br />
					he lives aloof from grasping<br />
					what is not his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes only what is given,<br />
					and expecting that gifts will come,<br />
					he passes his life in honesty<br />
					and purity of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away unchastity,<br />
					he is chaste.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof,<br />
					far off from the vulgar practice,<br />
					from the sexual act.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away lying words,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from falsehood.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks truth,<br />
					from the truth he never swerves;<br />
					faithful and trustworthy,<br />
					he breaks not his word to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away slander,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from calumny.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he hears here<br />
					he repeats not elsewhere<br />
					to raise a quarrel<br />
					against the people here;<br />
					what he hears elsewhere<br />
					he repeats not here<br />
					to raise a quarrel<br />
					against the people there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he live as a binder together<br />
					of those who are divided,<br />
					an encourager of those who are friends,<br />
					a peacemaker,<br />
					a lover of peace,<br />
					impassioned for peace,<br />
					a speaker of words that make for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away rudeness of speech,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from harsh language.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever word is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the car,<br />
					lovely,<br />
					reaching to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasing to the people,<br />
					beloved of the people -<br />
					such are words he speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away frivolous talk,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from vain conversation.</p>

					<p class="f4">In season he speaks,<br />
					in accordance with the facts,<br />
					words full of meaning,<br />
					on religion,<br />
					on the discipline of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks, and at the right time,<br />
					words worthy to be laid up in one's heart,<br />
					fitly illustrated,<br />
					clearly divided,<br />
					to the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof<br />
					from causing injury to seeds or plants.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					not eating at night,<br />
					refraining from food after hours<br />
					(after midday).</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from being a spectator<br />
					at shows at fairs,<br />
					with nautch dances,<br />
					singing, and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from wearing,<br />
					adorning,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then just, young Brahman,<br />

					<p class="f4">And gladness springs up within him<br />

					<p class="f4">Then estranged from lusts,<br />

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so pervade,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, young Brahman, as a skilful bathman<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, young Brahman,<br />
					the Bhikshu suppressing all reasoning and investigation<br />
					enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna,<br />
					a state of joy and ease,<br />
					born of the serenity of concentration,<br />
					when no reasoning or investigation goes on,<br />

					<p class="f4">'And his very body does he so pervade,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Just, young Brahman,<br />
					as if there were a deep pool,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then further, young Brahman, the Bhikshu,<br />
					holding aloof from joy,<br />

					he experiences in his body<br />
					that ease which the Arahats talk of when they say:<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, young Brahman,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then further, young Brahman, the Bhikshu,<br />

					any dejection,<br />
					he had previously felt,<br />
					enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna,<br />
					a state of pure self-possession and equanimity,<br />
					without pain and without ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sits there<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, young Brahman,<br />

					is that so noble body of doctrine regarding intellect,<br />
					of which that Exalted One was wont to speak in praise,<br />
					to which he used to incite the folk,<br />
					in which he established them,<br />
					and made them firm."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wonderful is this, Ānanda, and mysterious —<br />
					both that this so noble group of doctrine regarding intellect is well-rounded,<br />
					not incomplete;<br />
					and that I perceive no other,<br />
					like unto it,<br />
					among the other Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas<br />
					outside of this communion.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there is not, in this matter,<br />
					anything further to be accomplished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent, Ānanda,<br />
					are the words of thy mouth,<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which has been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which has been hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that those who have eyes<br />
					could see external forms -<br />
					just even so has the truth been made known to me,<br />
					in many a figure,<br />
					by the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, even I, betake myself<br />
					to that venerable Gotama as my guide,<br />
					to the truth,<br />
					and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the venerable Ānanda receive me<br />
					as an adherent,<br />
					as one who, from this day forth,<br />
					as long as life endures,<br />
					has taken them as his guide."</p>
