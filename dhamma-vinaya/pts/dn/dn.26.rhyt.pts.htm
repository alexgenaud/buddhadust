					<p>A<span class="f2">SOKA</span> states in his Edicts that it was the horrors of actual warfare, as brought to his notice during his conquest of Kalīnga, that led him to the propagation, in those Edicts, of the Dhamma - the Norm - as the only true conquest. So the Buddha is represented in this Suttanta as setting out his own idea of conquest (not without ironical reference to the current ideas), and then as inculcating the observance of the Dhamma - the Norm - as the most important force for the material and moral progress of mankind.</p>

Teufelsdröckh's Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a skeptical English Reviewer (referred to as Editor) who also provides fragmentary biographical material on the philosopher. The work is, in part, a parody of Hegel, and of German Idealism more generally. However, Teufelsdröckh is also a literary device with which Carlyle can express difficult truths.<br />

					<p>The whole is a fairy tale. The personages who play their part in it never existed. The events described in it never occurred. And more than that: a modern writer, telling a story to emphasize a moral, would always, like the creator of the immortal Dr. Teufelsdröckh, endeavour to give probability, vraisemblance, to the characters and events of his tale. Here the very opposite would seem to be the case. Recourse is had rather to the shock of improbability. This is in accord with the procedure in other cases (for instance, in the story of Sharp-tooth the Priest; or in that of the Riddles of the God<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>). The point of the moral - and in this fairy tale the moral is the thing - is the Reign of Law. Never before in the history of the world had this principle been proclaimed in so thorough-going and uncompromising a way. But of course it is not set out in such arguments as we find in modern treatises on ethics or philosophy. The authors are not writing a monograph on history or ethics. They are preaching a gospel, and their method is to state their view, and leave the hearer to accept it or not, just as he pleases.</p>

					<p>The view was, so to speak, in the air at that time. The whole history of religion, in India as elsewhere, had been the history of a struggle between the opposing ideas, or groups of ideas, that may be summed up by the words Animism and Normalism.</p>

					<p><a id="pg54"><span class="f2 g"><b>[54]</b></span></a> Animism has now become a well-known term. It is based on the very ancient hypothesis of a soul — a subtle, material homunculus, or manikin, supposed to dwell in the heart of a man. This afforded what seemed a simple and self-evident explanation of many mysterious things. When in his dream a man saw another, whom, when the dreamer woke, he knew to have been dead, he at once concluded, on the evidence of the dream, that the person he saw in his dream was still alive. It is true he had seen the body dead. But it was self-evident that a something, he knew not what, but very like the body, was still alive. He did not reason much about it, or stay to weigh the difficulties involved. But he was much too frightened of it to forget it. Once formed, the hypothesis was widely used. When a man awoke in the morning, after hunting all night in his dreams, and learnt from his companions that his body had been there all the time, it was, of course, his soul that had been away. In a similar way, death and trance and disease could be ascribed to the absence of the soul. Souls were believed to wander from body to body. Animals had souls, even things had souls, if they were uncanny, or when they seemed to have life and motion and sound. The awe-inspiring phenomena of nature were instinctively regarded as the result of spirit action; and rivers, plants, and stars, the earth, the air, and heaven, became full of souls of gods, each of them in fashion as a man, and with the passions of a man.</p>

					<p>But wide-reaching as this hypothesis was, it could not cover everything. From the earliest times of which we have any record we find, in India as elsewhere, quite a number of religious beliefs and ceremonies which were not explained, and could not be explained by the hypothesis of a soul. In other words, they are not animistic. The first impression we get is that of the bewildering variety of such beliefs. But they can be arranged, with more or less exactitude, into overlapping groups — and behind all the groups can be discerned a single underlying principle. That principle is the belief in a certain rule, order, law. We have no word for such a belief in English; and this, since the theory is as important, in the ancient Indian religions, as Animism, is a pity. I have suggested, in my lectures on Comparative Religion in Manchester, to call it Normalism.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx80 marl6">
							<p>In the term 'Normalism' hear his 'Norm' = 'Dhamma'</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p>Of course the men who held the beliefs, and practised the ceremonies so named, had no clear conception of the theory of Normalism, just as they had no clear conception of the theory of Animism. But they unmistakably held the view that things happened, effects were brought about, without <a id="pg55"><span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span></a> the agency of a soul or god, and quite as a matter of course; and they regarded that as the rule in such and such a case. Now we do not ourselves believe in the rule, or in any one of the rules, thus laid down (any more than we believe in the hypothesis of a homunculus within the heart). But the word Animism has been found most useful in clearing up our appreciation of ancient views. Its usefulness is limited, it is true. It covers rather less than half of the main beliefs recorded in the most ancient literatures of the world. The other half would be covered by the corresponding hypothesis of Normalism.</p>

					<p>This is not the place to raise the question of the importance of Normalism in the general history of religions. Perhaps one of the reasons why, in Europe, so much more attention has been paid to Animism, maybe the general trend of belief in Europe being itself predominantly Animistic. But it is at least certain that in the far East, and more especially in China and India, Normalism is the more important of the two.</p>

							<p>Tao or Dao is a Chinese concept signifying 'way', 'path', 'route', or sometimes more loosely, 'doctrine' or 'principle', or as a verb, speak. Within the context of traditional Chinese philosophy and religion, Tao is a metaphysical concept originating with Laozi that gave rise to a religion and philosophy referred to in English with the single term Taoism.<br />
							<span class="f1">— article and image courtesy of Wikipedia</span></p>
						</div>

					<p>In China it is the basis of the theory of the Tao (the Way), which finds its earliest expression in the famous tractate of <a id="tao" href="../../../dhammatalk/lao-tzu_tao-te-ching/lao-tzu_tao-te-ching.htm">Lao Tsu,</a> but was undoubtedly earlier than that, and is taken for granted also by Confucius.</p>

						</div>

					<p>The Tao is quite Normalistic; and though much debased in later times in the official circles of Taoism, the early form of it has never ceased to influence the various intellectual centres of Chinese belief. The theory of Yang and Yin, also so widely, indeed universally, held in China, and also going back to very early times, is equally Normalistic. No one of these three conceptions was ever personified. All three rested on the idea of law, or rule, independent of any soul.</p>

					<p>In India, our earliest records, the thousand and more Vedic hymns, seem at first sight to be altogether Animistic. They consist almost exclusively in appeals to various gods. The European books on Indian religions are concerned in treating of the Vedic period, with descriptions of these gods, based on the epithets applied to them, or the acts attributed to them, and so on. But these poems make no pretension to being a complete statement of the beliefs held by the tribes whose priests made or used the poems. Other poems, not included in our present collection, were doubtless extant in the community at the time when the collection was made. Other beliefs, not mentioned in the poems, were widely influential among the people. What we have is not complete even as a summary of the theosophy or the ritual <a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> or the mythology of the priests; and it refers only incidentally to other beliefs, unconnected with gods, of great importance as a factor in religion and daily life.</p>

					<p>This conclusion might be justified as rendered necessary by a critical consideration of the simple, known facts as to the composition of the anthology we call the <i>Rig Veda.</i> It is confirmed by the discovery in later Vedic books, especially in the manuals of domestic rites, of customs and beliefs, that must evidently go back to the <i>Rig Veda</i> period (though not referred to in that collection); and even of one or two such cases that certainly go back to an earlier period still. We have space here for only one or two sample instances, and even they can only be treated in the merest outline.</p>

					<p>Take the case of Rita. The meaning of the word would seem to have passed through some such evolution as motion, rhythmic motion, order, cosmic order, moral order, the right. In those slowly moving ages a long period must be postulated for the growth and consolidation of such ideas. The word is found, incidentally mentioned, at the end of its career, in the Avesta and the Veda. It must have been in full use before the Persian Aryans had separated from the Indian Aryans. The idea may therefore with reasonable probability be traced back to the third millennium before Christ. The use of the word died out in India before the time of the rise of Buddhism. Of the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads it occurs only in one — the <i>Taittirīya.</i> In the peroration to that work Rita is placed above, before the gods. The word occurs, it is true, in three or four isolated passages of post-Buddhistic works, but these are archaisms. It has not been traced in either the Buddhist or the Jain canonical literature.</p>

					<p>The process of the gradual decline in the use of an abstract word is precisely analogous to the process of the gradual decay and death of a god.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> The word covers not one idea only, but a number of connotations. The implications involved in it are constantly, though imperceptibly, changing. Sooner or later one or other phase of it overmasters the others, and some new word or words, emphasizing some one or other of the various connotations of the older word, come gradually into use as more adequate or more clear. When that process is complete, the older word is dead. But it lives again in the newer word, or words, that have taken its place, and would never have been born or thought of unless the older word had previously lived. It was so with Rita — a broader and deeper conception than the Greek Moira; and <a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> more akin to the Chinese Tao. Like these, Rita was never personified, and it lives again in the clearer and more definite (though still very imperfect) phrases of the Suttanta before us now.</p>

					<p>The case of Rita is by no means unique. I have elsewhere discussed at some length another case, that of Tapas or self- mortification, austerity.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> It was held in India from Vedic times onwards that tapas (originally burning glow, but afterwards used of fasting and other forms of self-mortification) worked out its effects by itself, without the intervention of any deity. This is only the more remarkable since it is almost certain that in India, as elsewhere, the ecstatic state of mind which rendered such austerity possible was originally often regarded as due to the inspiration of a spirit. But it is, so far as I know, never mentioned that the supranormal effects of the austerity were due to the spirit from whom the inspiration came. The effects were due to the austerity itself. Very often indeed there was no question of any deity's help in the determination to carry out the self-torture — just as in the case of the <i>pujāris</i> at the <i>ghats</i> in modern India.</p>

					<p>Even the very sacrifice itself — made to gods, supposed to give sustenance and strength to gods, accompanied by hymns and invocations addressed to gods — was not entirely free from such Normalistic ideas. The hymns themselves already contain phrases which suggest that their authors began to see a certain mystic power over the gods in a properly conducted sacrifice. And we know that afterwards, in the Brāhmanas, this conception was carried to great lengths. So also we have evidence of a mystic power, independent of the gods, in the words, the verses, that accompany the sacrifice. And it is no contradiction of this that we find thus mystic power itself deified and becoming, indeed, in the course of centuries of speculation, the highest of the gods. And it is significative, in this connection, that the string of Behaspati's bow is precisely Rita.</p>

					<p>It would be tedious (and it would also, after the above instances, be unnecessary, I trust) to quote the very numerous other instances in Vedic works of a slighter character and less importance, showing the existence of a theory of life the very opposite of Animism. They are naturally only quite incidental in the <i>Rig Veda</i> itself, and more and more frequent as the books get later, being most numerous in the Sūtra <a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> period. Many of these can be classed under one or other of the various meanings given by anthropologists to the ambiguous and confusing word Magic<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> — the magic of names, or numbers, or propinquity, or likeness, or association, or sympathy, and so on. Many will also be found in the long list of practices from which it is said in the <i>Sīlas</i> (one of the very earliest of our Buddhist documents, earlier than the <i>Piṭakas</i>) that the Samana Gotama refrains.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>The above suffices to show something of the position of Normalism in pre-Buddhistic India. Our present Suttanta shows the stage it had reached in the period of the early Buddhists. It is a stage of great interest — differing, as it does, from the line of development followed by Normalism in other countries.</p>

							<p class="f2 in2">To him, thus behaving,<br />

							the Celestial Wheel revealed itself,<br />

							<p class="f2 in2">And seeing this<br />

							<p class="f2 in2">Then, brethren,<br />

							<p class="f2 in2">The king, the sovran war-lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">8.6. Now, brethren, after many years,<br />
					after many hundred years,<br />

					<p class="f4">'If thou shouldst see, sirrah,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Even so, sire,'<br />

					<p class="f4">Now after many years,<br />

					<p class="f4">On seeing that<br />

					<p class="f4">'Know, sire, for a truth<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the King, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Behold, dear boy,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now it has been told me:</p>

					<p class="f4">I have had my fill of human pleasures;<br />

					<p class="f4">Come, dear boy,<br />

					<p class="f4">But I,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, brethren, the King,<br />
					having in due form<br />
					established his eldest son on the throne,<br />
					shaved hair and beard,<br />
					donned yellow robes<br />
					and went forth from home<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">But on the seventh day<br />
					after the royal hermit had gone forth,<br />
					the Celestial Wheel disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Then a certain man went to the king,<br />

					and told him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Know, O king, for a truth,<br />
					that the Celestial Wheel has disappeared!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king,<br />
					the anointed Kshatriya,<br />

					and afflicted with grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he did not go to the hermit-king<br />

					<p class="f4">By his own ideas, forsooth,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren,<br />

					prosper not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there are in thy kingdom<br />
					ministers and courtiers,<br />

					guards and custodians,<br />
					and they who live by sacred verses —<br />
					both all of us and others —<br />
					who keep the knowledge<br />

					<p class="f4">Lo! O king,<br />
					do thou ask us concerning it;<br />
					to thee thus asking<br />
					will we declare it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Then, brethren, the king,<br />
					the anointed warrior,<br />
					having made the ministers<br />
					and all the rest sit down together,<br />

					of a sovran war-lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they declared it unto him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had heard them,<br />
					he did provide the due watch and ward and protection,<br />

					<p class="f4">And because this was not done,<br />

					<p class="f4">When poverty was thus become rife,<br />
					a certain man took<br />

					<p class="f4">Him they caught,<br />

					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This man, O king, has taken<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the king spake thus to the man:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, sirrah,<br />

					<p class="f4">'It is true, O king.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt66" href="../../pali/dn/dn.26.pali.bd.htm#pg66"><span class="f2">[66]</span></a> Then the king bestowed wealth on that man,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Even so, O king',<br />
					replied the man.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Now another man, brethren,<br />

					what was not given him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him they caught and brought before the king,<br />

					<p class="f4">12. Now men heard, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">And hearing they thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">Among humans of the latter span of life, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">Among humans of the latter span of life, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then to some of those beings it will occur:</p>

					<p class="f4">And at the end of those seven days,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Hail, O mortal,<br />

					<p class="f4">O happy sight to find thee still alive!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now, only because we had gotten into evil ways,<br />

					<p class="f4">Let us now abstain from taking life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is a good thing<br />

					<p class="f4">And they will abstain from slaughter,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt74" href="../../pali/dn/dn.26.pali.bd.htm#pg74"><span class="f2">[74]</span></a> And to them thus increasing<br />

					<p class="f4">22. Then this, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now we,<br />

					<p class="f4">Let us now do still more good.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they will practise these virtues,<br />

					they abstain abstain from covetousness,<br />

					they become filial<br />

					<p class="f4">And because of the good they do<br />
					they will increase in length of life,<br />

					so that the sons of them<br />

					<p class="f4">Among such humans,<br />
					this India<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span> will be mighty and prosperous,<br />

					<p class="f4">Among such humans<br />
					the Benares of our day<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Among such humans in this India<br />

					<p class="f4">24. Among such humans, brethren,<br />
					at Ketumatī the royal city,<br />

					a Wheel-turning king,<br />
					righteous and ruling in righteousness,<br />
					lord of the four quarters,<br />
					conqueror,<br />
					protector of his people,<br />
					possessor of the seven precious things.</p>

					<p class="f4">His will be these seven precious things,<br />

					<p class="f4">More than a thousand also<br />

					<p class="f4">He will live in supremacy<br />

					<p class="f4">25. At that period, brethren,<br />
					<a id="pt76" href="../../pali/dn/dn.26.pali.bd.htm#pg76"><span class="f2">[76]</span></a> there will arise <a id="pg74"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span></a> in the world<br />
					an Exalted One named Metteyya,<br />

					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					an Exalted One,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					even as I am now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself,<br />
					will thoroughly know and see,<br />
					as it were face to face,<br />
					this universe,<br />
					with its worlds of the spirits,<br />
					its Brahmās and its Māras,<br />
					and its world of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					of princes and peoples,<br />
					even as I now, by myself,<br />
					thoroughly know and see them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth [the Norm]<br />
					lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />

					the higher life will he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness<br />
					and in all its purity,<br />
					even as I do now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He will be accompanied by a congregation<br />

					<p class="f4">26. Then, brethren, King Sankha will raise up again<br />
					the fairy palace<br />
					which the King Great Panāda<br />
					had had built.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And therein will he dwell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But afterwards<br />
					he will give it away,<br />
					hand it over as a gift<br />
					to recluses and brahmins,<br />
					to the destitute,<br />
					wayfarers and beggars.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he himself,<br />
					cutting off hair and beard,<br />
					will don the yellow robes,<br />
					and leave his home<br />
					for the life that is homeless<br />
					under Metteyya the Exalted One,<br />
					the Arahant fully awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he, having thus left the world,<br />
					will remain alone and separate,<br />
					earnest, zealous and master of himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">And ere long he will attain<br />
					to that supreme goal<br />
					for the sake of which<br />

					into the homeless state;<br />
					yea, that supreme goal will he,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> But how, brethren,<br />

					as an island unto himself,<br />
					as a refuge unto himself,<br />
					taking no other as his refuge?</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he live<br />
					with the Norm as his island,<br />
					with the Norm as his refuge,<br />
					taking no other refuge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brethren,<br />
					a brother as to the body,<br />
					as to the feelings,<br />
					as to thought,<br />
					as to ideas, continues so to look upon these<br />
					that he remains ardent,<br />
					self-possessed,<br />
					and mindful,<br />
					that he may overcome both the hankering<br />
					and the dejection<br />
					common in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, brethren,<br />
					does a brother live as an island unto himself,<br />
					as a refuge unto himself,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, brethren,<br />
					does a brother live with the Norm as his island,<br />

					<p class="f4">28. Keep to your own pastures, brethren,<br />
					walk in the haunts where your fathers roamed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If ye so walk,<br />

					<p class="f4">And what is the meaning<br />

					to wit:<br />
					action, effort, and concentration<br />

					<p class="f4">From practising and developing<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning<br />

					to a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the meaning<br />
					of comeliness<br />
					to a brother?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, that a brother live<br />
					in the practice of right conduct,<br />
					restrained according to the Rules of the Order,<br />
					perfect in behaviour and habitude;<br />
					he sees danger<br />
					in the least of the things he should avoid<br />
					and, taking the precepts<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> on himself,<br />
					he trains himself therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is comeliness for a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the meaning<br />
					of happiness for a brother?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, that a brother<br />
					estranged from lusts,<br />
					aloof from evil dispositions,<br />
					enters into and remains in the First Jhāna<br />
					— a state of zest and ease born of detachment,<br />
					application and persistence of attention<br />
					going on the while.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then suppressing all application and persist- <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> ence of attention,<br />
					he enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna,<br />
					a state of zest and ease,<br />
					born of the serenity of concentration,<br />
					wherein the mind is lifted up alone,<br />
					and the heart grows calm within.</p>

					<p class="f4">And entering into the Third Jhāna<br />
					he abides calmly contemplative<br />
					while, mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his body that ease<br />
					whereof Aryans declare<br />
					'He that is calmly contemplative and aware,<br />
					he dwelleth at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And by putting aside ease<br />
					and by putting aside malaise,<br />
					by the passing away of the happiness<br />
					and of the melancholy<br />
					he used to feel,<br />
					he enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna,<br />
					rapture of utter purity<br />
					of mindfulness and equanimity,<br />
					wherein neither ease is felt<br />
					nor any ill.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is happiness for a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the meaning of wealth for a brother?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein that a brother abides<br />
					letting his mind fraught with love<br />
					pervade one quarter of the world,<br />
					and so too the second quarter,<br />
					and so the third,<br />
					and so the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus the whole wide world,<br />
					above, below, around, and everywhere,<br />
					and altogether does he continue to pervade<br />

					abounding, sublime, and beyond measure,<br />
					free from hatred and ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he lets his mind<br />
					fraught with pity<br />
					pervade one quarter of the world,<br />
					and so too the second quarter,<br />
					and so the third,<br />
					and so the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus the whole wide world,<br />

					free from hatred and ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he lets his mind fraught with sympathy<br />
					pervade one quarter of the world,<br />
					and so too the second quarter,<br />

					<p class="f4">And thus the whole wide world,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he lets his mind<br />

					<p class="f4">This is wealth for a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the meaning of power for a brother?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, that a brother,<br />
					by destruction of the deadly taints,<br />
					enters into and abides in<br />
					that untainted emancipation of mind<br />
					and of insight,<br />
					which he by himself<br />
					has both known and realized.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is power for a brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">I consider no power, brethren,<br />
					so hard to subdue<br />
					as the power of Māra.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this merit<br />
					<i>[the merit of these four groups of ethical concepts, beginning at Right Conduct, and culminating in Arahantship]</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span><br />
					expands, brethren,<br />
					by the taking up into oneself<br />
					of that which is good."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart the brethren rejoiced at the words of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> It is impossible to render the pregnant phrase into intelligible English without a paraphrase. There is a play upon the words <i>vatta,</i> and <i>Ariya.</i> <i>Vatta</i> means turning, but also duty (the way one ought to turn). Franke has <i>Widme dich der hohen Cakkavatti-Pflicht.</i> On the threefold meaning of <i>Ar(i)yan</i> — racial, ethical, and aesthetic — see Rhys Davids, <i>Early Buddhism,</i> 49, 50. On the new meaning here put into the curious word Wheel-turner, see <a href="#pg53">Introduction.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> 'The Norm' is 'Dhamma'. We must coin a word for this. Both French and Germans have a better word in <i>droit</i> and <i>Recht,</i> each of which means both law and right. See Mrs. Rhys Davids above, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm#pg325">II, 325,</a> and <i>Buddhism</i> (1912), 227. The whole passage in the Pali is a striking outburst on the superiority of right over might, on the ideal of empire as held by the early Buddhists. Its eloquence has suffered much in our translation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> In this parody on the ordinary methods of conquest all the horrors and crimes of war are absent. The conqueror simply follows the bright and beneficent Wheel, and the conquered, with joy and trust, ask only for instruction.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> It should be noticed that this king is apparently doing his best — what he thinks is best — and yet that his action leads to long-continued and disastrous results. It is as if a man, doing his best, goes under a tree for protection during a storm, and is struck by lightning attracted by the tree. The cosmic law, the Dhamma, the Norm, acts on in the realm of morals as it does in the realm of physics. The law is inexpugnable, <i>res inexorabilis</i>. If the law is not observed, the consequences are inevitable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Lit. wives of <i>garu's (guru's)</i>. The <i>Comy.</i> interprets this to mean wives of little father or great father — <i>i.e.</i> wives of father's brothers, younger and older.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>Migo,</i> deer, is capable of meaning all game, or wild animals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> <i>Satth'antara-kappa. Sattha</i> is sword; <i>antara-kappa</i> is a period included in another period. Here the first period, the one included, is seven days. See Ledi Sadaw in the <i>Buddhist Review,</i> January, 1916.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> <i>Sabhāgāyissanti.</i> Both text and commentary are corrupt. Perhaps one should read <i>sabhāgā bhavissanti</i> (one of three consecutive and very similar <i>aksharas</i> having fallen out). In the next clause read <i>satta.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> <i>Kukkuṭa-sampātikā,</i> lit. cock's-flightish. R. Morris discusses this phrase in vain, <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1885_ii.pdf"><i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1885, p. 38.</a> At <i>Divyāvadana,</i> p. 316, the editors (in the Index) give it up and suggest reading <i>kakura.</i> Franke here translates 'resembling flocks of birds.' Compare also <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya</i></a> IV, 131. Buddhaghosa says here that another reading, <i>kukkuṭa-sampādikā</i> is also possible in the sense of within a cock's walk, which amounts to much the same thing as the translation adopted above. [Ed.: See <a href="../../../dhammatalk/lao-tzu_tao-te-ching/lao-tzu_tao-te-ching.htm#note"><i>Tao Te Ching</i></a> for another possible explanation of this term.]</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p><i>Tertium quid.</i> An unknown but suspected to exist element in combination with known elements. The essential, known element in <i>'Avīci'</i> is 'uninteruptedness.' It's use for a description of Hell is in connection with the idea of unremitting pain.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Avīci.</i> The <i>tertium quid</i> of this comparison is obscure. The Waveless Deep was, in later books, one of the purgatories. We, in this twentieth century, may well think a country so densely populated a purgatory. But the authors of our document are evidently speaking in praise, not disparagement of the density of the population. Can the Waveless Deep, in this connexion, have been originally used in that sense? Buddhaghosa naturally explains it so, but that is not conclusive. The word does not occur in the four Nikāyas except in this passage (which recurs at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.056.pali.bd.htm"><i>Aṅguttara</i> I, 159</a>). It does not occur in the list of the purgatories given in the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg121"><i>Sutta Nipāta</i> (pp. 121-7)</a> and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.06.001-015.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.6.13"><i>Samyutta</i> I, 154.</a> It is found in a poem in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p89"><i>Itivuttaka</i> (No. 89),</a> which recurs in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya</i></a> (II, 203), and in the <i>Dhamma-Sangani,</i> § 1,281. But the history of <i>Avīci</i> and of the purgatory idea in India has yet to be written. In <i>Vis. Magga</i> <i>avīci</i> = disintegration (p 449).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> <i>Ayaɱ Bārānasī.</i> As the discourse was said to have been delivered in Magadha, the allusion must have been rather to the city as contemporary than to any contiguity in space. But perhaps the story may have had its origin among the Kāsis.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> This is added from Buddhaghosa. He does not think that the merit referred to is the conquest of Māra. That follows from the destruction of the mental intoxications. See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#pg92">above, I, 92,</a> and § I of this Suttanta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Rhys Davids abbreviates the third and Fourth Jhāna, and working back the closest near description is found in <a href="dn.22.rhyt.pts.htm">DN 22,</a> where the translation of the first and second Jhānas are somewhat different. Here is his translation from that sutta:</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">Herein, O bhikkhus, a brother, aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First Jhāna, wherein there is cogitation and deliberation, which is born of solitude and is full of joy and ease.</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">Suppressing cogitation and deliberation he enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna, which is self-evoked, born of concentration, full of joy and ease, in that, set free from cogitation and deliberation the mind grows calm and sure, dwelling on high.</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">And further, disenchanted with joy, he abides calmly contemplative while, mindful and self-possessed, he feel in his body that ease whereof Aryans declare 'He that is calmly contemplative and aware, he dwelleth at ease.' So does he enter into and abide in the Third Jhāna.</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">And further, by putting aside ease and by putting aside malaise, by the passing away of the happiness and of the melancholy he used to feel, he enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna, rapture of utter purity of mindfulness and equanimity, wherein neither ease is felt nor any ill.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Working forward, there is still another version in DN 29:</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">...aloof from sensuous appetites, aloof from evil ideas, enters into and abides in the First Jhāna, wherein there is initiative and sustained thought which is born of solitude and is full of zest and ease.</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">Secondly, when suppressing initiative and sustained thought, he enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna, which is self-evoked, born of concentration, full of zest and ease, in that, set fre from initial and sustained thought, the mind grows calm and sure, dwelling on high.</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">Thirdly, when a brother, no longer fired with zest, abides calmly contemplative, while mindful and self-possessed he feels in his body that ease whereof Ariyans declare: He that is calm contemplative and aware, he dwelleth at ease, so does he enter into and abide in the Third Jhāna.</p>

							<p class="f3 in4">Fourthly, by putting aside ease and by putting aside malaise, by the passing away of the joy and the sorrow he used to feel, he enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna, rapture of  utter purity of mindfulness and equanimity, wherein neither ease is felt nor any ill.</p>
