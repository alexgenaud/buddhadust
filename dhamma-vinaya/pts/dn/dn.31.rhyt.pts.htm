					<h4 class="ctr">Introduction<Br />
					to the<Br />
					Sigālovāda Suttanta</h4>

					<p>This Suttanta has been translated into English by <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/misc/dn/dn.31.grim.misc.htm">by Gogerly</a> in Grimblot, <i>Sept Suttas Palis</i> (Paris, 1876), by Gogerly, <i>J.R.A.S.,</i> Ceylon Branch, 1847, and by R.C. Childers in the Contemporary Review, London, 1876.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> The latter entitled it <i>The Whole Duty of the Buddhist Layman.</i></p>

					<p>Childers doubtless sought to draw the eye of the general reader by a title borrowed from a well-known English classic. At this time of day we should look, under a claim so comprehensive, for some statement of political duties, for allusions to the senate and the forum, to affairs national and international. It is not enough to reply that these questions of wider ethics had not arisen. The Saddhamma was promulgated, it is true, in the kingdoms of autocrats like Pasenadi of Kosala, and Bimbisāra and Ajātasattu of Magadha. But it was taught at the same time in the villages of the free clansmen of the Sākiyan, Koliyan, Licchavi and other republics. And among these the whole duty of the layman might well have included some corporate ideals of citizenship. There is certainly in one or two of the foregoing dialogues enough to show that Gotama could have uttered a discourse on such a theme. Either he judged that his listeners were not ready for it, or that the occasion did not call for it. Or it maybe that his chroniclers, cut off from political interests, failed to preserve or edit such sayings. But possibly 'layman' is susceptible, at least in our day, of a wider implication than <i>gihī,</i> house-man. And hence 'whole duty' were better modified as 'whole domestic and social duty.'</p>

					<p>Anyway, the Buddha's doctrine of love and goodwill between man and man is here set forth in a domestic and social ethics with more comprehensive detail than elsewhere. In a Canon compiled by members of a religious order and largely concerned with the mental experiences and ideals of recluses, and with their outlook on the world, it is of great interest to find in it a Sutta entirely devoted to the outlook <a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> and relations of the layman on and to his surroundings. And the discourse was felt to possess this interest in the long past by Buddhaghosa, or by the tradition he handed on, or by both. In this Sutta, he writes, 'nothing in the duties of housemen is left unmentioned. This Suttanta is called the Vinaya of the Houseman. Hence in one who practises what he has been taught in it, growth is to be looked for, and not decay.' And truly we may say even now of this Vinaya, or code of discipline, so fundamental are the human interests involved, so sane and wide is the wisdom that envisages them, that the utterances are as fresh and practically as binding to-day and here as they were then at Rājagaha. 'Happy would have been the village or the clan on the banks of the Ganges, where the people were full of the kindly spirit of fellow-feeling, the noble spirit of justice which breathes through these naive and simple sayings.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Not less happy would be the village, or the family on the banks of the Thames to-day, of which this could be said.</p>

					<p>The object of the young Sigāla's open-air matins will seem unfamiliar to the readers who are more accustomed to the names of Vedic deities surviving in the allusions scattered throughout these dialogues — "to Brahmā and Prajāpati, Indra and Soma, Varuṇa and Isāna.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> He was probably no brahmin, or we might have found him tending Agni's perpetual fire, or bathing his conscience clean in some stream of symbolical efficacy. The Commentary does not help us. The historical sense had not developed when the great commentators wrote, and they are incurious as to beliefs and rites that were possibly no longer alive at least in their own environment. It is a noteworthy instance of this that Buddhaghosa is silent regarding the deities just named, when he is commenting on the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p13">Tevijja-Suttanta,</a> as well as on the string of tremendous attributes ascribed to Great Brahmā in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p11">Kevaddha Suttanta</a> that comes before it. We may picture him as we would a mediaeval Christian exegetist. In his milieu, Indian or Singhalese, a certain cosmology had long been traditional and orthodox. Outside it there were now other cults, pantheistic, polytheistic, atheistic. He doubtless held that discussion on the gods of these or older alien cults was as superfluous as discussion on Baal or Jupiter might have seemed to his Christian colleague. The only deva of whom, in the Kevaddha-Suttanta he has anything to say is Sakka (concerning whom the text is silent). And Sakka was just the quasi-human governor in the nearest, lowest heaven after earth.</p>

					<p><a id="pg170"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></a> For Buddhaghosa the heavens were filled, not with gods in our sense of the word, but, at least as to those mentioned in that Sutta, with devas who are one in kind with ourselves, and who will in due time become once more men and women on earth, such as they have already been times without number, unless they, in their upward way, have attained to the Never-returner's stage of advancement.</p>

					<p>But we, more curious than the Commentators, may find evidence in Brahmanic literature that the quarters or regions of the external world <i>(disā),</i> or mighty spirits inhabiting them were invoked for protection generally, and especially in battle, for luck and against snakes, etc. In the Atharva-veda (III, 26,	27) are two of such <i>rakshamantras</i> (guarding runes) or <i>parittas,</i> as they are called by Buddhists (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p32">the following Suttanta</a>). Here we have the same six regions — viz., the four cardinal points, the fixed and the upward regions.</p>

					      <p class="in2">Ye gods that are in the Eastern quarter,<br />
							missiles by name,<br />
							of you there the arrows are fire!<br />
							Do ye be gracious to us,<br />
							do ye bless us!<br />
							To you be there homage!<br />
							To you there Hail! etc.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>No. 27 identifies a god with each region, not the Four Kings of Buddhist cosmology<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> but Agni, Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Visnu, Brihaspati. To their jaws the invoker consigns his enemies. In the Satapatha Brāhmana<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> five, and also seven <i>disā's</i> as well as four are mentioned in rites. In the Grihya Sutras<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> the four quarters are to be worshipped in connection with certain rites. And so much self-anointing or contact with water is enjoined that the lay celebrant may well have had both hair and garments wet as Sigāla had.</p>

					<p>Hence it may well be that there was nothing eccentric or even unusual in these orisons of the filially-minded 'householder's son,' as he is called. It is true that the Commentary speaks of his being asked, What are you doing? But the Master asks only, Why are you worshipping so the several quarters? If he was interrupted and shown a better channel for the sending forth of his votive gestures, this was because the hour had come when the Exalted One saw him. Saw him not then only, is the Comment, but at dawn already had the Teacher, surveying the world with the Buddha-vision, seen him so engaged and had decided that 'this day will I <a id="pg171"><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></a> discourse to Sigāla on the layman's Vinaya. That discourse will be of benefit to many folk. There must I go.' And so he passed by him going to Rājagaha for alms. And when Sigāla saw him standing near, 'the Exalted One, like a great lotus expanding at the touch of the rays of the sun, opened his mouth and spoke.'</p>

					<p>The conversion from the invoking of animistically conceived nature-forces to that loving service to fellow-beings which is the truest worship of Deity, was the more easily effected because Sigāla's own convictions were not involved. The Commentary expands his own words by relating that his parents were pious upāsakas (lay followers), but could not persuade their son to accompany them to hear the good Doctrine. Nay, he would say, 'I'll have naught to do with Samaṇas. Doing homage to them would make my back ache, my knees stiff. I should have to sit on the ground and soil and wear out my clothes. And when at the conversations with them, after so sitting, one gets to know them, one has to invite them and make them presents, and so one only loses by it.' Finally the father on his deathbed bethought him of a pious ruse. If he, an upasaka's son, were daily to practise disā-worship, the Master or his disciples would be sure to see him and teach him better things. And since deathbed wishes are to be remembered, the son remembered and obeyed.</p>

						</div>

					<p>The standpoint taken in this charming code of domestic and other relations, and the reciprocal duty resulting therefrom, calls here for just one remark. It will be noticed that in summing up the latter, the parable of the six-quarter-worship is maintained throughout. As good and loving gods take compassion upon <i>(anukampanti)</i> their sincere devotees, who wait upon them with offerings material and spiritual, so in all the six relations adduced the seniors are represented functioning as little gods, the juniors or subordinates as devotees. The one exception may be in the case of friends equal in age and other respects. The word expressing the duty towards the six seniors: <i>paccupaṭṭhātabbā</i> (the passive gerund) is rare,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> but its meaning is clearly that of attendance in tending. Etymologically it is to be re-as-sisted. <i>Anukampanti</i> is the type-word for the protecting tenderness of the stronger for the weaker, and means vibrating along-after. It thus in emotional force is even stronger than our compassion or sympathy. And because the pulsing emotion is other-regarding, a feeling-together what- <a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> ever the loved one feels, it is justifiable to render it often by love, thus taking the smaller concept up into the greater. Gotama frequently claims to feel this godlike emotion:</p>

					      <p class="fp3 in2"><i>Hitanukampī Sambuddho yad-aññaṇ anusāsati</i></p>

							<p class="in2">Love and compassion doth th'Enlightened feel<br />
							Towards another when he teacheth him.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>In the attitude of parent to child love is at bottom a tender compassion, a vibrant care to protect. So wife-love is largely motherly. Parent, wife, friend, master, teacher and religieux all rank, in Gotama's social Vinaya, and for that matter in that of India generally, as little gods, so great is the responsibility attaching to these six positions, so fine is the opportunity for exercising compassion, tender care, protection. In the six reciprocal aspects there is an element of childhood. The child under loving compassionate protection feels safe and confident as does the believing worshipper. And ideally, such childlike security and confidence is the attitude of student to teacher, husband to wife, friend to friend, servant to master.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels Feeding ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at this time young Sigāla,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a householder's son,<br />
					rising betimes,<br />
					went forth from Rājagaha,<br />
					and with wet hair and wet garments<br />
					and clasped hands uplifted,<br />
					paid worship to the several quarters of earth and sky: —<br />
					to the east, south, west, and north,<br />
					to the nadir and the zenith.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And the Exalted One<br />
					early that morning dressed himself,<br />
					took bowl and robe<br />
					and entered Rājagaha seeking alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now he saw young Sigāla worshipping<br />
					and spoke to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, young householder, do you,<br />
					rising betimes and leaving Rājagaha,<br />
					with wet hair and raiment,<br />
					worship the several quarters of earth and sky?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, my father, when he was a-dying,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Dear son, you should worship the quarters of earth and sky.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I, sir, honouring my father's word,<br />

					revering,<br />
					holding it sacred,<br />
					rise betimes<br />
					and, leaving Rājagaha,<br />
					worship on this wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But in the religion of an Ariyan, young householder,<br />
					the six quarters should not be worshipped thus."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How then, sir, in the religion of an Ariyan,<br />
					should the six quarters be worshipped?</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be an excellent thing, sir,<br />
					if the Exalted One would so teach me the doctrine<br />
					according to which, in the religion of an Ariyan,<br />
					the six quarters should be worshipped."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg174"><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span></a> "Hear then, young householder,<br />
					give ear to my words and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, sir", responded young Sigāla.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Inasmuch, young householder,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple has put away<br />
					the four vices in conduct,<br />
					inasmuch as he does no evil actions<br />
					from the four motives,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					inasmuch as he does not pursue<br />
					the six channels for dissipating wealth,<br />
					he thus, avoiding these fourteen evil things,<br />
					is a coverer<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> of the six quarters;<br />
					he has practised so as to conquer both worlds;<br />
					he tastes success<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> both in this world and in the next.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the dissolution of the body, after death,<br />
					he is reborn to a happy destiny in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four vices of conduct<br />
					that he has put away?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> The destruction of life,<br />
					<b>[2]</b> the taking what is not given,<br />
					<b>[3]</b> licentiousness,<br />
					<b>[4]</b> and lying speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four vices of conduct<br />
					that he has put away."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And when the Blessed One had thus spoken,<br />
					the Master spake yet again:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Slaughter of Life, theft, lying, adultery:<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil deeds are done from motives of<br />

					<b>[2]</b> enmity,<br />
					<b>[3]</b> stupidity<br />
					<b>[4]</b> and fear.</p>

					is not led away by these motives,<br />
					he through them does no evil deed."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And when the Blessed One had thus spoken, the Master spake yet again:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Whoso from partiality or hate<br />
							Or fear or dullness doth transgress the Norm,<br />
							All minishèd good name and fame become<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "And which are the six channels<br />

					<p class="f4"><b>[1]</b> The being addicted to intoxicating liquors,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<b>[6]</b> he is not sought after by those who would give or take <a id="pg176"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span></a> in marriage,<br />
					for they would say that a man who is a gambler<br />
					cannot afford to keep a wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">12.	Six, young householder, are the perils<br />
					from associating with evil companions:<br />
					<b>[1]</b> any gambler,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> If he sees you fallen down anywhere in the village after drinking spirits, he sits down by you till you wake, lest your cloak should be stolen. <i>Comy.</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> If you go to him burdened with a commission involving outlay, he presses you to accept double what you will require to spend. <i>Comy.</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> The literal sense of <i>anu-kamp-ako</i> is one who vibrates because of. See <a href="#pg171">p. 171 f.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> On a hill in the night. <i>Comy.</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Thus Buddhaghosa prettily amplifies, taking the idea perhaps from <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/kd/dhp/dhp.04.than.ati.htm#v49">Dhammapada, ver. 49.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> <i>Mittāni.</i> Cf. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.10.001-012.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.10.12"><i>S.</i> I, 214.</a> The <i>Comy.,</i> explains by <i>mitte,</i> friends.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Which portion is to serve for doing good? asks B. The first; with it he can both give gifts to religienx and the destitute, and can pay wages to weavers, bathmen, etc. [for personal services as distinct from trade dealings].</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The symbolism is deliberately chosen: as the day in the East, so life begins with parents' care; teachers' fees and the South are the same word: <i>dakkhiṇa;</i> domestic cares follow when the youth becomes man, as the West holds the later day-light; North is 'beyond,' so by help of friends, etc., he gets beyond troubles.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Kula-vaṇsa</i> implies both. B. explains it as not dissipating property, restoring, if need be, the family honour and integrity, and maintaining gifts to religienx.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> <i>Anukampanti,</i> and so below. See <a href="#n27">p. 179, n. 1.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> To conveyancing, or as an accountant, etc., according to the family tradition. <i>Comy.</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> Both on suitable occasions and at death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> Childers has obedience. This is quite wrong. Considering the enormous importance attached in the autocratic states and religious Orders of Europe to obedience, it is most worthy of notice that obedience does not occur in Buddhist ethics. It is not mentioned in any one of the 227 rules of the Buddhist Order. It does not occur in any one of the clauses of this summary of the ethics of the Buddhist layman, and it does not enter into any one of the divisions of the Eightfold Path nor of the thirty-seven constituent qualities of Arahantship. Hence no member of the Buddhist order takes any vow of obedience; and the vows of a Buddhist layman ignore it. Has this been one of the reasons for the success of Buddhism? It looked beyond obedience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> B. thus interprets <i>paṭibhānavā</i> in this connexion, <i>viz.,</i> on the occasion of worshipping the quarters.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.,</i> the four bases of popularity, says B. These are liberality, affability, beneficence, impartiality (cf. Childers <i>s.v.,</i> <i>saṇgaha,</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.30.rhyt.pts.htm#pg145">above, p. 145</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> So B.: given these qualities the world goes round. <i>Cf.</i> the French adage: <i>C'est l'amour, qui fait le monde a la ronde.</i></p>
