					<p class="f4">An English translation of this Suttanta by the Rev. Suriyagoda Sumangala was published at Calcutta in 1904 by the Mahābodhi Society.</p>

					<p class="f4">It and the following Suttanta, in concluding the <i>Dīgha Nikāya,</i> form for that work a novel departure. Novel, not because they are compiled as catechisms - we have already met with an exposition so compiled in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Suttanta, Vol. II, pp. 337 - 45,</a> where there is a lengthy discourse, possibly an interpolation, by question and answer, on the so-called Four Aryan Truths, another in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">Mahā Nidāna Suttanta (Vol. II, pp. 51 - 68),</a> not to mention yet other dialogues which are in part catechetical. The novelty lies in this, that the materials are arranged on the plan observed at much greater length throughout the Fourth, or <i>Aṇguttara Nikāya.</i> This plan is not that of the first and second <i>Nikāyas,</i> which are professedly grouped according to length, nor that of the third <i>Nikāya,</i> where the grouping is more intelligently done, namely, according to subject. It is a grouping where the points or chief items brought forward are grouped numerically and in arithmetical progression. Recourse to it must have been on mnemonic grounds, grounds that would be of great importance in an unwritten mass of doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not equally obvious why the compilation of doctrinal items in this form should have been attributed to Sariputta. In the Commentarial tradition of the procedure at the First Council, as told by Buddhaghosa,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in the Commentary on the <i>Dīgha Nikāya,</i> it is related that, whereas Ānanda was required to testify to the circumstances under which every Sutta in the <i>Nikāyas</i> was uttered, the other three <i>Nikāyas</i> were handed over to the disciples of (the late) Sariputta, Mahā Kassapa (the president) and Anuruddha respectively. Thus it was the <i>Majjhima</i> that fell to the school of Sariputta, and not the <i>Aṇguttara,</i> as we should have expected, had Sariputta, in his teaching, always preferred the numerical method. Nor is his teaching more amply represented in the Suttas of the <i>Aṇguttara</i> than in those of <a id="pg199"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span></a> the second and third <i>Nikāyas.</i> Sariputta's gift of teaching was not one able to express itself in one channel only. His manifold powers as a teacher are eloquently testified to by more than one distinguished apostle, witness the eulogies of Ānanda, Vangīsa, Mahā Kassapa, Mahā Moggallāna his fellow 'chief-disciple,' and by the Master himself.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> He is in one of these testimonials praised for his ability to summarize as well as to expand:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>He teaches first in outline brief<br />
							And then expands in full detail.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It was of prime importance in this unwritten gospel so to summarize that expansion was possible with the maximum of accuracy and the minimum of muddle and difficulty. And he on whom the duty would fall, should he survive his chief - which he did not - of faithfully maintaining and propagating the inherited doctrine, was naturally deeply concerned to get a correct catalogue of such summaries, while the leader was at hand to sanction them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some such reasoning may have led the compilers of these two last Suttantas to ascribe them to Sariputta. All that we now know is that each of them forms a sort of thematic Index to the doctrines scattered through the Four <i>Nikāyas,</i> that they follow the <i>Aṇguttara</i> method of arrangement, but that they contain here and there matter which suggests that they took their present shape at a later date than the bulk of the rest of the <i>Dīgha.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In the two features they have in common, of catechism as a monologue by the catechumen, and of the absence of narrative (<i>nidāna</i> or <i>vatthu</i>), this further interest attaches to these last Suttantas, that they become practically <i>Abhidhamma</i> rather than <i>Sutta Piṭaka</i>. In the oldest division of the body of doctrine called in the <i>Piṭakas</i> the nine <i>Angas</i> or parts, one is <i>Veyyākaranam,</i> translatable as answering, or expounding. Under this <i>Anga</i> all the sort of catechetical dialogue was included that was called from the early days of the Order's history <i>Abhidhamma-Katha,</i> translatable as 'advanced discourse on doctrine.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Most of this <i>Anga</i> was at a later date systematized and expanded as the third or <i>Abhidhamma Piṭaka.</i> But some of it remained in the <i>Nikāyas.</i> In the <i>Khuddaka</i> or Fifth <i>Nikāya</i> there is a whole book of it: - the <i>Patisambhidā-magga,</i> or Analytic Course.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a> Another pair of books, the <i>Niddesas,</i> though we class them as Commentaries, are practically <i>Abhidhamma.</i> And embedded in two of the other <i>Nikāyas</i> we have on the one hand <i>Abhidhamma</i>-talk in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p43">the two <i>Vedalla-Suttas</i></a> of the <i>Majjhima</i> (I, 299 f., though Buddhist tradition classes them under a <i>Vedalla-anga</i>), and on the other, these two lengthy <i>Abhidhamma</i>-lists in the <i>Dīgha</i> here presented.</p>

					<p class="f4">The important Kashmirian Buddhist school of the Sabbatthivādins (Sanskrit: Sarvāstivādins), or 'Everything-exists-doctrinaires,' were so satisfied that the former of these two - the <i>Saṇgīti Suttantaṃ</i> - was proper 'Advanced talk,' that they placed it, or their own version of it among the seven works which, according to Tibetan and Chinese translations, constituted their <i>Abhidhamma</i> books. It is variously classed as No. 2, 3 or 7, and in the Chinese recensions is still ascribed to Sariputta. The Tibetan recensions father it on Mahā-Koṭṭhita, the Apostle who in the Majjhima is the speaker in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p43">major Vedalla-Sutta.</a> The episode that may possibly have stimulated Sariputta or the compilers of the two Suttantas to lose no time in drawing up summarized doctrines - the death of the Jain leader and the subsequent disputes among that body - is repeated in the Sabbatthivādin recension. We are indebted for what we know of this recension to Professor J. Takakusu's admirable essay on <i>'The Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma Books'</i> in the <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1904-5_v.pdf"><i>Journal of the Pali Text Society,</i> 1904-5.</a> Space-limits prevented him from giving a full list of the summaries, but all he does give occur also in our Saṇgīti Suttantaṃ. Some day a full comparison will be possible.</p>
