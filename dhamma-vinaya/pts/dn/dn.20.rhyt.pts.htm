					<p class="f4">The Blessed One was once dwelling among the Sakiyas,<br />
					at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood,<br />
					together with a great band of the brethren,<br />
					about five hundred of them,<br />
					all being Arahants.</p>

					<p class="f4">And gods from the ten thousand world-systems<br />
					oft-times assembled there<br />
					that they might visit the Exalted One<br />
					and the band of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now to four gods of the hosts of the Pure Abodes<br />
					this thought occurred:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That Blessed One is now dwelling among the Sakiyas, at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood,<br />
					together with a great band of the brethren,<br />
					about five hundred of them,<br />
					all being Arahants.</p>

					<p class="f4">And gods from the ten thousand world-systems<br />
					oft-times are assembling there<br />
					to see the Exalted One and his band of brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if we, too,<br />
					were to go into his presence,<br />
					and before him<br />
					were to recite each of us a poem?'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then those gods,<br />
					as easily as a strong man might stretch out his arm,<br />
					or draw back his out-stretched arm,<br />
					vanished from the Pure Abodes,<br />
					and appeared before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they saluted him<br />
					and stood on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so standing<br />
					one of the gods recited to the Blessed One<br />
					this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Great is the gathering in the glade!<br />
							The hosts of heaven together met!<br />
							We too are come unto this congress blest,<br />
							and fain would see<br />
							The Company Invincible.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another god recited to the Exalted One this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg285"><span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span></a> The brethren there, wrought up to concentration rapt,<br />
							make straight their hearts.<br />
							Wisely, as driver keeping grip on rein,<br />
							their faculties they guard.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another god recited to the Exalted One this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'All bars and bolts are hewn in twain for them,<br />
							The threshould is dug up.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							In purity, their way they go,<br />
							Stainless, with vision clear,<br />
							like well-tamed elephants.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the other god recited to the Exalted One this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Who in the Buddha refuge take,<br />
							they shall not go to woeful doom.<br />
							When they put off this human frame they shall fill up the hosts in heaven.'</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Then said the Exalted One to the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oft-times, brethren,<br />
					do gods from the ten world-systems<br />
					foregather to see the Tathāgata<br />
					and the company of the Brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever, brethren,<br />
					in the past<br />
					were Arahant Buddhas supreme,<br />
					upon them waited a like number of the heavenly hosts,<br />
					and a like number shall wait upon whosoever shall,<br />
					in the future,<br />
					be Arahant Buddhas supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will detail to you, brethren,<br />
					the names of the hosts of gods,<br />
					I will publish abroad, brethren,<br />
					their names,<br />
					I will teach you, brethren,<br />
					their names.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken hereunto<br />
					and pay heed,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord,'<br />
					responded the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">5. 'In measured speech I will give utterance: —<br />
							Where'er their realm, there will ye find the gods,<br />
							But they who in the bowels of the hills<br />
							Sit with heart throughly purged and well composed, <a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a><br />
							Like to so many lions crouching still,<br />
							Are vanquishers over the creeping dread,<br />
							White-minded, pure, serene and undefiled.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Seeing within Kapilavatthu's grove<br />
							Five hundred such and more, disciples all,<br />
							To them who loved his word the Master spoke:<br />
							"Celestial hosts draw nigh!<br />
							Look to it, brethren, that ye them discern!"<br />
							And they, hearing the Buddha's word, forthwith<br />
							Strove ardently to see.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">6.	And lo! in them<br />
							Arose vision of those not born of men.<br />
							Some saw one hundred gods, ten hundred, some,<br />
							And some saw seventy thousand, others saw<br />
							Infinite multitudes thronging around.<br />
							And all their sight and seeing He Who Sees<br />
							Intuitively marked and understood.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Then to his followers who loved his Word<br />
							The Master turned and spoke: — "Celestial hosts<br />
							Draw near! Them do ye, brethren, recognize<br />
							As I, in rhythmic speech, each in their turn<br />
							Proclaim them unto you in order due:—"</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">7.	Seven thousand Yakkhas of our country's soil<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">Thus have I sixteen thousand Yakkhas told,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">Kumbhira, too, of Rājagaha town,<br />
							Having his dwelling on Vepulla's mount,<br />
							More than a hundred thousand in his train,<br />
							This Yakkha likewise to the wood is come.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">9.	King Dhataraṭṭha rules the Eastern clime,<br />
							Lord of Gandhabbas, mighty monarch he,<br />
							With splendid following. Sons has he too,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">Virūḷha, ruler of the Southern clime,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg288"><span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span></a> Virūpakkha rules o'er the Western clime,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">So stood those four great kings within the wood<br />
							Of Kapilavatthu, on the four climes<br />
							Shedding effulgent radiance round about:<br />
							Over the East King Dhataraṭṭha shone,<br />
							To right, Virūḷhaka, westward<br />
							Virūpakkha, Kuvera o'er the North.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">10. With them are come their vassals versed in craft,<br />

							To see the brethren met together there.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">11. Now too Nāgas are come from Nabhasa,<br />

							<a id="pg289"><span class="f2 g"><b>[289]</b></span></a> Kambalas, Assataras, Pāyagas<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">They who twice-born,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> winged and keen<br />
							Of sight, the heavenly Harpies who,<br />

							Gaudy and Well-winged are their names —<br />

							The cobra kings felt quite secure.<br />
							A refuge from the dreadful birds<br />
							Buddha had made. With gentle words<br />
							Entreating one another they,<br />
							The Harpies and their prey alike<br />
							To the Buddha as their Sanctuary come.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">12. They whom the Lightning-Hand did smite,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">13. The gods of Fire and Water, Earth and Air<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">20. Then Tissa, the Eternal Youth, and with<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">22. And He-Who-Sees by insight knew all this<br />

							"And they, hearing the Buddha's word, forthwith<br />

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> 'The bars and bolts and hindering threshould stone of lust, ill-will and stupidity,' explains Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The connexion of the various clauses of this stanza is obscure; and the interpretations of the native scholars differ. We have followed the version of lhe Colombo Sannaya of 1891. Samarasekhara's translation (Col. 1905) takes the <i>assitā</i> in line 1 to refer to the Arahants. Buddhaghosa's commentary may be understood either way. All agree in referring <i>ñatvā</i> in line 5 to the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Yassassino,</i> glossed here by Buddhaghosa as <i>parivārasam-pannā,</i> and later, in this Suttanta, by <i>yasena samannāgatā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> All birds are twice-born, first from the mother's womb (when she lays the egg), and then from the egg itself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> These are all born of Sujā, Vāsava's mother, and had been driven out of heaven by 'Him-with-the-thunderbolt-in-his-hand.' The latter had been identified, at the time when this poem was composed, with Sakka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> That is, their uncle Rāhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The Castor and Pollux of Indian mythology.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This seems to come in here most strangely: but it is an epithet of Sakka expressly designed to distinguish him from Indra, the Vedic god, whose epithet was 'Destroyer of Towns,' see p. 297.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> On these described in the Brahmajala Suttanta, see Dialogues I,
					32, 33.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Nimmānarati, Paranimmita[vasavatti].</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> In this word-play, Nāgo means also N'āgu, not having sin, says the Cy.: — <i>āgiɱ akaraṇato.</i> So the gods, too, make bad puns! — untranslatable ones, alas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Upapanno.</i> Note the Buddhist care to bring even 'Great Brahmā' under the universal Law, '<i>rem inexorabilem.</i>'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The inter-dependence of the clauses, and also of the names, in this stanza, is ambiguous. It may hereafter become clear that the author (or authoress) thought of Tissa and the Eternal Youth as two distinct persons, or of the Eternal Youth and the Great Brahmā of the Buddha's time as one. The grammar is against the first of these suppositions. But we have seen (above, p. 272, 3) that the Mahā-Brahmā of Govinda's time was Sanɱ-kumāra, the Eternal Youth (so also D. I, 200 compared with D. II, 209, 225); and Tissa according to tradition (Smp. p. 296, 7) was the name of a Mahā-Brahmā. Buddhaghosa explains 'the Potent One' <i>(iddhi mā)</i> as the Buddha; it is much more likely to have been intended for Brahmā, who claims (above, p. 247) to have acquired the potency of <i>iddhi.</i><br />
					This legend of the Ever-virgin Knight, Sanaɱ-kumāra, is the Indian counterpart of the European legend of Sir Galahad. The oldest mention of it is in the Chāndogya Upanished (Ch. VII), where the ideal of the saintly knight teaches a typical brahmin about the highest truth (compare Deussen's note on p. 171 of 'Sechzig Upanishads'). In the Nikāyas the Eternal Youth is frequently quoted as the author of a famous verse which says that, though the knight takes precedence among all those that trust in lineage, he that is perfect in wisdom takes precedence over all (see above, I, 121, and M. I, 358; S. I, 153; A. V, 326. At S. II, 284 the verse is ascribed to the Buddha). A similar sentiment is ascribed to him in the Great Bhārata. In mediaeval literature he is said to have been one of five or seven mind-born sons of Brahmā, like the Sons of the Potent One in our verse. (For the five see the references in Wilson's 'Vishṇu Purāṇa,' I, 38; for the seven those in Garbe's 'SĀɱkhya-philosophie,' p. 35). Buddhaghosa has a similar tale (quoted J.R.A.S., 1894, p. 344). A later and debased Jain version of the legend tells us at length of the love adventures and wives of the chaste knight, with a few words at the end on his conversion to the saintly life (Jacobi, 'Ausgewählte Erzählungen in Mahāra<i>sht</i>rī pp. 20-28, translated by de Blonay in 'Rev. de l'H. des Rel.,' 1895, pp. 29-41).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Kaṇho, for Māra. Cf. Kālī, the Black Woman.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Māra is called Mahā-seno, his army being of course senā. The Pāli, making no distinction between <i>syena</i> (hawk) and <i>sena,</i> it is not impossible that a pun is here intended.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> We have followed the traditional interpretation in ascribing these last four lines to Māra. They may quite as well, or better, be a statement by the author himself.</p>
