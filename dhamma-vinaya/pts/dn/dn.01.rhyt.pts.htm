					<h4>Introduction to the Brahma-<i>G</i>âla Sutta</h4>.

					<p>The phase of beliefs which this Suttanta is intended to meet, into which its argument fits, has been set out in some detail in the opening chapter of my 'American Lectures.' As there pointed out<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, the discussion which thus opens this series of dialogues forms also the first question in the Kathā Vatthu, and the first question in the Milinda. We cannot be far wrong if, in our endeavours to understand the real meaning of the original Buddhism, we attach as much weight to this question as did the author or authors of these ancient and authoritative Buddhist books.</p>

					<p>The Suttanta sets out in sixty-two divisions<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> various speculations or theories in which the theorisers, going out always from various forms of the ancient view of a 'soul' - a sort of subtle manikin inside the body but separate from it, and continuing, after it leaves the body, as a separate entity - attempt to reconstruct the past, or to arrange the future. All such speculation is condemned. And necessarily so, since the Buddhist philosophy is put together without this ancient idea of 'soul.'</p>

					<p>The Buddhist scheme endeavours, in other words, to include all the truth which previous thinkers had grafted on to the old savage theories of a semi-material, subtle, permanent entity inside the body, while rejecting those theories themselves; it endeavours to retain all the philosophic truth which previous thinkers had grafted on to the theosophies - the corollaries of the soul theories - while rejecting those theosophies themselves. The reasons given for this position are threefold: firstly, that such speculators about ultimate things, <a id="pgxxvi"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xxvi]</b></span></a> either in the past or the future, have insufficient evidence, see only one side of the shield;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> secondly, that such speculations do not lead to emancipation, to Arahatship;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and thirdly, that such theories are really derived from the hopes, the feelings, and the sensations arising from evanescent phenomena<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> - they belong, in other words, to the realm of hastily formed, empirical opinion <i>(diṭṭhi),</i> not to that of the higher wisdom <i>(paññā).</i> So that Buddhism, in the first place, holds a position somewhat similar to the modern Agnostic position. Secondly, while acknowledging the importance of feeling and of intellect, it lays special stress upon the regulation, the cultivation, of the will<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>. And thirdly, it distinguishes between a lower and a higher wisdom,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p>Several scholars, and especially — with more knowledge and detail — Dr. Karl Neumann, have maintained that the position of Buddhism in the history of Indian philosophy is analogous to that of Schopenhauer in European philosophy. On the other hand, it is maintained by Professor Deussen that Schopenhauer's position is analogous to that of the Upanishads. The reconciliation will probably be found to be that what Buddhism took over, with more or less of modification, from the Upanishads, is about the same as that part of the Upanishad doctrine which is found, in European phraseology, in Schopenhauer; and what Buddhism rejected altogether is not to be found in Schopenhauer. He himself, who however knew both systems only from second-hand and inaccurate authorities, says, 'If I am to take the results of my own Philosophy as the standard of truth, I should be obliged to concede to Buddhism the pre-eminence over other (systems of philosophy).'</p>

					<p>However this question may be decided - and its discussion, at the necessary length, by a competent student of philosophy, is a very pressing want - it is certain from the details given in our Suttanta that there were then current in Northern India many other philosophic and theosophic speculations besides those the priests found it expedient to adopt, and have preserved for us in the Upanishads. And who can doubt but that some, if not all of them, may also have had their influence on the new doctrine? There was always much philosophising in India outside the narrow and inexact <a id="pgxxvii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xxvii]</b></span></a> limits of the so-called six Darsanas; and we have to thank Buddhist scholars for preserving, in their Pāli and Sanskrit works, the evidences of such philosophy as the priests wished to exclude from notice<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> See the paper on <i>'The Will in Buddhism,'</i> <i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1898.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> See below, <a href="#pg42">p. 42, etc.,</a> of this Suttanta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Professor Cowell has been good enough to inform me that, in his opinion, the attempted restriction of all philosophy to the six Darsanas, and the very use of the term, is late mediaeval. The six are of course not mutually exclusive; and this, and the omissions in the classification of philosophy under these six heads, render it rather like a classification of animals into men, horses, birds, ghosts, beetles, and sparrows.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The whole of this Sutta was translated into English by the Rev. Daniel Gogerly, Wesleyan missionary in Ceylon, in the journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1846 (reprinted by P. Grimblot in his <i>'Sept Suttas Palis,'</i> Paris, 1876).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Nālandā, afterwards the seat of the famous Buddhist university, was about seven miles north of Rājagaha, the capital of Magadha, the modern Raj-gir (Sum. p. 35).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Suppiya was a follower of the celebrated teacher Sañjaya, whose views are set out and controverted in the next Sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Ambalaṭṭhikā,</i> 'the mango sapling.' It was, says Buddhaghosa (pp. 41, 42), a well-watered and shady park so called from a mango sapling by the gateway. It was surrounded with a rampart, and had in it a rest-house adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There was another garden so named at Anurādhapura in Ceylon, to the east of the Brazen Palace (Sum. 1, 13 1). This was so named, no doubt, after the other which was famous as the scene of the 'Exhortation to Rāhula starting with falsehood,' mentioned in Asoka's Bhabra Edict (see my 'Buddhism,' pp. 224, 225).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> These titles occur, in the MSS., at the end of the sections of the tract that now follows. It forms a part of each of the Suttas in the first division, the first third, of this collection of Suttas. The division is called therefore the Sīla Vagga or Section containing the Sīlas. The tract itself must almost certainly have existed as a separate work before the time when the discourses, in each of which it recurs, were first put together.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Certain paragraphs from this tract occur also elsewhere. So in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.029.pali.bd.htm#pg197">Majjhima I, 179</a> we have the whole of the short paragraphs; in Majjhima, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p76">Nos. 76</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p77">77,</a> and in Mahāvagga V, 8, 3, we have § 17; in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg3">Majjhima II, 3</a> we have most of § 18; and so on. The whole of this tract has been translated into English by Gogerly (in Grimblot, see page 1, note), into French by Burnouf (also in Grimblot, pp. 212 foll.), and into German by Dr. Neumann (in his Buddhistische Anthologie, pp. 67 foll.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> This refrain is repeated at the end of each clause. When the Sīlas recur below, in each Sutta, the only difference is in the refrain. See, for instance, the translation of <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.03.pali.bd.htm#pg100">p. 100</a> in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Neumann has 'waiting for a gift' which is a possible rendering: but pātikankhati has not yet been found elsewhere in the sense of 'waiting for.' The usual meaning of the word expresses just such a trifling matter as we have been led, from the context, to expect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>Gāma-dhammā,</i> 'from the village habit, the practice of country folk the "pagan"' way.' One might render the phrase by 'pagan' if that word had not acquired, in English, a slightly different connotation. It is the opposite of porī, urbane (applied to speech, below, §9). Neumann misses the point here, but has 'höflich' below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Porī.</i> See note above on § 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Sampha-ppalāpa. Sampha</i> occurs alone in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp9">Hemavata Sutta,</a> and at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_545">Jāt. VI, 295;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_11_ekadasakanipata.htm#p22">A. 11, 23.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Samārambhā</i> cannot mean 'planting' as Dr. Neumann renders it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>Kaɱsa-kūṭa.</i> The context suggests that <i>kaɱsa</i> (bronze) may here refer to coins, just as we say in English 'a copper,' and the word is actually so used in the 11th and 12th Bhikkhunī Nissaggiya Rules — the oldest reference in Indian books to coins. The most ancient coins, which were of private (not state) coinage, were either of bronze or gold. Buddhaghosa (p.79) explains the expression here used as meaning the passing off of bronze vessels as gold. Gogerly translates 'weights,' Childers sub voce has 'counterfeit metal,' and Neumann has 'Māss.' Buddhaghosa is obliged to take kaɱsa in the meaning of 'gold pot,' which seems very forced ; and there is no authority for kaɱsa meaning either weight or mass. On the whole the coin explanation seems to me to be the simplest.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa gives examples of each of these five classes of the vegetable. kingdom without explaining the terms. But it is only the fourth which is doubtful. It may mean 'graftings,' if the art of grafting was then known in the Ganges valley.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>Āmisa.</i> Buddhaghosa (p. 83) gives a long list of curry-stuffs included under this term. If he is right then Gogerly's 'raw grain' is too limited a translation, and Neumann's ' all sorts of articles to use' too extensive. In its secondary meaning the word means something. nice, a relish, a dainty.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Visūka-dassanaɱ.</i> This word has only been found elsewhere in the phrase <i>diṭṭhi-visūkaɱ,</i> 'the puppet shows of heresy' (Majjhima I, pp. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.002.pali.bd.htm#pg8">8,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg486">486;</a> and Serissaka Vimāna LXXXIV, 26). The Sinhalese renders it <i>wiparīta-darsaṇa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Dancing. cannot mean here a dancing in which the persons referred to took part. It must be ballet or nautch dancing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Literally 'shows.' This word, only found here, has always been rendered 'theatrical representations.' Clough first translated it so in his Sinhalese Dictionary, p. 665, and he was followed by Gogerly, Burnouf, myself (in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 192), and Dr. Neumann (p. 69), - and Weber (Indian Literature, pp. 199, 319) seems to approve this. But it is most unlikely that the theatre was already known in the fifth century B. C. And Buddhaghosa (p. 84) explains it, quite simply, as naṭa-samajjā. Now samajjo is a very interesting old word (at least in its Pāli form). The Sanskrit, according to the Petersburg Dictionary, has only been found in modern dictionaries. The Pāli occurs in other old texts such as Vinaya 11, 107 ; IV, 267 (both times in the very same context as it does here); ibid. II, 150; 1V, 85; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p31">Sigālovāda Sutta,</a> p.300;[Ed.?] and it is undoubtedly the same word as <i>samāja</i> in the first of the fourteen Edicts of Asoka. In the Sigālovāda there are said to be six dangers at such a <i>samajjo;</i> to wit, dancing, singing, music, recitations, conjuring tricks, and acrobatic shows. And in the Vinaya passages we learn that at a samajjo not only amusements but also food was provided; that high officials were invited, and had special seats; and that it took place at the top of a bill. This last detail of 'high places' (that is sacred places) points to a religious motive as underlying the whole procedure. The root <i>ag</i> (Gr. αγω, ago, whence our 'act') belongs to the stock of common Aryan roots, and means carrying on. What was the meaning of this 'carrying on together'? Who were the people who took part? Were they confined to one village? or have we here a survival from old exogamic communistic dancings together? Later the word means simply fair,' as at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_438">Jātaka III, 541</a>:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'Many the bout I have played with quarterstaves at the fair,' with which <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_96">Jātaka I, 394</a> may be compared. And it is no doubt this side of the festival which is here in the mind of the author; but 'fair' is nevertheless a very inadequate rendering. The Sinhalese has rapid movement in dance-figures' <i>(ranga-maṇḍalu).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> These ballad recitations in prose and verse combined were the source from which epic poetry was afterwards gradually developed. Buddhaghosa has no explanation of the word, but gives as examples the Bhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa. The negative <i>anakkhānaɱ</i> occurs <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg503">Majjhima I, 503.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains this as 'playing on cymbals'; and adds that it is also called pāṇitā'aɱ. The word is only found here and at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_537">Jātaka V, 506,</a> and means literally 'hand-sounds.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says 'deep music, but some say raising dead bodies to life by spells.' His own explanation is, I think, meant to be etymological; and to show that he derives the word from <i>vi</i> + <i>tāḷa.</i> This would bring the word into connection with the Sanskrit <i>vaitāḷika,</i> 'royal bard.' The other explanation connects the word with <i>Vetāla,</i> 'a demon,' supposed to play pranks (as in the stories of the <i>Vetāla-pañca-viɱsati</i>) by reanimating corpses. Dr. Neumann adopts it. But it does not agree so well with the context; and it seems scarcely justifiable to see, in this ancient list, a reference to beliefs which can only be traced in literature more than a thousand years later. Gogerly's rendering funeral ceremonies,' which I previously followed, seems to me now quite out of the question.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> It is clear from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_537">Jātaka V, 506</a> that this word means a sort of music. And at Vinaya IV, 285 <i>kumbhathūnikā</i> are mentioned in connection with dancers, acrobats, and hired mourners. Buddhaghosa is here obscure and probably corrupt, and the derivation is quite uncertain. Gogerly's guess seems better than Burnouf's or Neumann's. The Sinhalese has 'striking a drum big enough to hold sixteen gallons.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa seems to understand by this term (literally 'of Sobha city') the adornments or scenery used for a ballet-dance. (<i>Paṭibhāṇa-cittam</i> at Vinaya 11, 151; IV, 61, 298, 358; Sum. 1, 42 is the nude in art.) Weber has pointed out (Indische Studien, II, 38; III, 153) that Sobha is a city of the, fairies much given to music and love-making. It is quite likely that the name of a frequently used scene for a ballet because a proverbial phrase for all such scenery. But the Sinhalese has 'pouring water over the heads of dancers, or nude paintings.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa takes these three words separately, and so do all the MSS. of the text, and the Sinhalese version. But 1 now think that the passage at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_495">Jātaka IV, 390</a> is really decisive, and that we have here one of the rare cases where we can correct our MSS. against the authority of the old commentator. But I follow him in the general meaning he assigns to the strange expression 'Kaṇḍāla-bamboo washings.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_438">Jātaka III, 541.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>Nibbuddhaɱ.</i> The verbal form <i>nibbujjhati</i> occurs in the list at Vinaya III, 180 (repeated at 11, 10); and our word at Milinda 232.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> All these recur in the introductory story to the 50th Pācittiya (Vinaya IV, 107). On the last compare Buddhaghosa on Mahāvagga V, I, 2 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> All these terms recur at Vinaya III, 180 (repeated at II, 10).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup>  Chess played originally on a board of eight times ten squares was afterwards played on one of eight times eight squares. Our text cannot be taken as evidence of real chess in the fifth century B. C., but it certainly refers to games from which it and draughts must have been developed. The Sinhalese Sanna says that each of these games was played with dice and pieces such as kings and so on. The word for pieces is <i>poru</i> (from <i>purisa</i>) - just our 'men'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> <i>Ākāsaɱ.</i> How very like blindfold chess !</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> <i>Parihāra-pathaɱ.</i> A kind of primitive 'hop-scotch.' The Sinhalese says the steps must be made hopping.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> <i>Santikā.</i> Spellicans, pure and simple.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> <i>Khalikā.</i> Unfortunately the method of playing is not stated. Compare Eggeling's note as in his Satapatha-Brāhmaṇa 11I, 106, 7. In the gambling-scene on the Bharhut 'Tope (Cunningham, PI. XLV, No. 9) there is a board marked out on the stone of six times five squares (not six by six), and six little cubes with marks on the sides visible lie on the stone outside the board.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Jhaṭikaɱ Something like 'tip-cat.' <i>Siɱ-kelīmaya</i> in Sinhalese.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> <i>Akkhaɱ.</i> The usual meaning is 'a die.' But the Sinhalese translator agrees with Buddhaghosa. Neither gives any details.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> <i>Pangacīram.</i> The Sinhalese for this toy is <i>pat-kulal</i>. Morris in <i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1889, p. 205, compares the <i>Marathīpungi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> <i>Akkharikā.</i> it is important evidence for the date at which writing was known in India that such a game should be known in the fifth century B. C.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> <i>Āsandī.</i> Buddhaghosa merely says 'a seat beyond the allowed measure,' but that must refer to height, as the only rule as to measure in seats is the 87th Pācittiya in which the height of beds or chairs is limited to eight 'great' inches (probably about eighteen inches). The Sinhalese Sanna adds 'a long chair for supporting the whole body.' At <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_33">Jāt. I, 208</a> a man lies down on an āsandī so as to be able to-look up and watch the stars.

The <i>āsandī</i> is selected as the right sort of seat for the king in both the Vājapeya and Inauguration ceremonies because of its height (Eggeling, Sat.-Brāh. III, 35, 105). It is there said to be made of common sorts of wood, and perforated; which probably means that the frame was of wood and the seat was of interlaced cane or wickerwork. The diminutive <i>āsandiko,</i> with short legs and made square (for sitting, not lying on), is allowed in the Buddhist Order by Vinaya 11, 149. And even the <i>āsandī</i> is allowed, if the tall legs be cut down, by Vinaya II, 169, 170 (where the reading <i>chinditvā</i> seems preferable, and is read in the quotation at Sum. 1, 88). The renderings 'large cushion' at 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 27 and 'stuffed couch' at 111, 209 must be accordingly corrected. Gogerly translates 'large couch,' Burnouf 'une chaise longue,' and Neumann 'bequeme Lehnstuhl.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> <i>Pallanko.</i> It is noteworthy that, in spite of the use of a divan with animals carved on its supports being here objected to, it is precisely the sort of seat on which the Buddha himself, or Buddhist personages of distinction, are often, in later sculptures, represented as sitting (Grunwedel, 'Buddhistische kunst,' pp. III, 124, 137; Mitra, 'Budh Gayā,' Plates XI, XX, etc. etc.). At Mahāvaɱsa 25 <i>sīhāsana</i> and <i>pallanko</i> are used of the same seat (Asoka's throne), and <i>sīhāsana</i> is used of Duṭṭha Gamini's throne, ibid. 157. But the Lion throne of Nissanka Malla, found at Pollonnaruwa, is not a <i>pallanko,</i> but an actual stone lion, larger than life size ('Indian Antiquary,' vol. 1, p. 135. Compare the similar seat in Grunwedel, p. 95).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">By Vinaya 11, 170 the possession of a <i>pallanka</i> was allowed to the Order if the animal figures were broken off (the translation in 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 209, must be altered accordingly, reading vāle for vale, as at Vinaya IV, 312). By Vinaya II, 163 it is laid down that members of the Order were not to use a complete <i>pallanko</i> even in laymen's houses, so that Nigrodha's action in the passage just quoted (Mahāvaɱsa 25) was really a breach of the regulations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> The words from <i>gonako</i> down to <i>kaṭṭhissaɱ</i> inclusive, and also <i>kuttakaɱ,</i> are found only in this list, and Buddhaghosa seems to be uncertain as to the exact meaning of some of them. All except No. 7 might be used in laymen's houses ('Vinaya Texts,' III, 197), and all might be possessed by the Order i used only as floor coverings (ibid. 111, 209); except again No. 7, the cotton wool of which might be utilised for pillows. As there is a doubt about the spelling it may be noticed that the Sanna reads goṇakaɱ and udda-lomiɱ: and the MS. in the R. A. S. (which repeats each sentence) has -<i>gonakaɱ</i> and <i>udda-lomiɱ</i> both times.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> <i>Sambāhanaɱ.</i> Perhaps rubbing the limbs with flat pieces of wood. See Buddhaghosa here and at 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 60.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> This is not quite accurate. Out of the twenty items here objected to, three (shampooing, bathing, and the use of sunshades) were allowed in the Order, and practised by Gotama himself. Bathrooms, and halls attached to them, are permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 189; shampooing by ibid. III, 68, 297. There are elaborate regulations for the provision of hot steam baths and the etiquette to be observed in them; and instances of the use of the ordinary bath in streams or rivers are frequent. The use of sunshades is permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' 111, 13 2-3, and is referred to ibid. 111, 88, 274.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> <i>Visikhā-kathā.</i> Buddhaghosa (p.90) takes this word (literally street-talk') in the sense of talk about streets, whether ill or well situate, and whether the inhabitants are bold or poor, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> <i>Pubba-peta-kathā.</i> The commentator confines this to boasting talk about deceased relatives or ancestors.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> <i>Nānatta-kathaɱ,</i> literally 'difference-talk.' The expression seems somewhat forced, if taken as meaning 'desultory'; but I see no better explanation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> <i>Lokakkhāyikā.</i> Buddhaghosa refers this specially to such speculations as are put forth according to the Lokātyata system by the Vitaṇḍas (also called Lokāyatikas). These are materialistic theorisers, of whose system very little is, so far, known. See the note at 'Vinaya Texts, vol. iii, p. 151. 1 have collected other references to them in my 'Milinda,' vol. i, p.7; and to these Dīgha I, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#pg11">11</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg114">114,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg120">120,</a> and Attha Sālinī, p.3, may now be added. They are probably referred to below in chap. iii of this Sutta, §§ 10, 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> 'This list of foolish talks recurs in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p76">Suttas 76-78</a> in the Majjhima, and at Vinaya I,188.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> These expressions all recur at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg3">Majjhima II, 3.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> <i>Sahitaɱ me,</i> literally 'the put together is to me,' etc. The idiom is only found here, and may mean either as rendered above, or 'the context is on my side,' or 'the text (of the Scriptures) is on my side,' or merely 'that which is of use is on my side.' This last, given by the Sanna, amounts to the same as the version adopted above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Putting the cart before the horse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> <i>Āropito te vādo.</i> On the use of this idiom compare the Commentary on the Therī Gāthā, p. 101. There is a misprint here in the text, <i>aropito</i> for <i>āropito.</i> 'Issue has been joined against you would be a possible rendering. It is the phrase used, when some one has offered to hold debate (maintain a thesis) against all corners, by an opponent who takes up the challenge.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> <i>Niggahīto si.</i> On this idiom compare the opening paragraphs of the <i>Kathā Vatthu</i> and the Commentary on them (especially pp. 9,10). It is literally 'you are censured.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> 3 <i>Cara vāda-pamokkhāya.</i> So Buddhaghosa. But Gogerly renders, 'Depart, that you may be freed from this disputation and the only parallel passage seems to support this view. It is <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.022.pali.bd.htm#pg133">Majjhima 1, 133,</a> where it is said to be wrong to learn the Scriptures for the sake of the advantage of being freed from discussion or debate where texts are quoted against one. <i>Pamokkha</i> occurs besides at Saɱyutta I, 2, Jātaka V, 30, 31, and Mahāvaɱsa 158, but not in this connection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> So the author of <i>Milinda</i> in making his hero Nāgasena use just such a phrase (Mil. P. 27) is making him commit a breach of propriety.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> <i>Kuhakā.</i> 'Astonish the world with the three sorts of trickery,' says Buddhaghosa. These are also referred to without explanation at <i>Jātaka</i> IV, 297 (where we should, 1 think, read <i>kuhana</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> Lapakā. Compare <i>Itivuttaka,</i> No. 99 = <i>Aŋguttara</i> I, 165, 168; and also <i>Milinda</i> 228, Jātaka III, 349.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> <i>Nemittakā,</i> 'interpreters of signs and omens.' See the note on <i>nimittaɱ</i> in the next paragraph. Compare <i>Milinda</i> 299; <i>Jāt.</i> IV, 124.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> <i>Nippesikā,</i> 'scarers away' (? of ghosts, or bad omens). But the Commentary and Sanna give no help, and the word has only been found in this list.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> All the five words in this list recur at <i>A.</i> III, iii but the context there is as undecisive as it is here, and the Commentary (fol. di of the 'Turnour MS. at the India Office), though slightly different, gives no better help.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> <i>Aŋgaɱ,</i> literally 'limbs.' Buddhaghosa distinguishes this from <i>lakkhaṇaɱ</i> (No. 5 in this list), and from <i>anga-vijjā</i> (No. 16). It is not found, in this sense, anywhere in the texts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> <i>Nimittaɱ,</i> literally 'marks,' or signs.' Buddhaghosa tells a story in illustration. King Paṇḍu, they say (Pāṇḍi in the Sanna), took three pearls in his closed hand, and asked a diviner what he had in it. The latter looked this way and that for a sign; and seeing a fly which had been caught by a house-lizard (the Sanna says 'by a dog,' perhaps the meaning is simply 'in sugar') getting free (<i>muttā</i>), said at once 'pearls' (also <i>muttā</i> in Pāli). 'How many?" says the king. The diviner, hearing a dog bark thrice, answered 'three.' Compare <i>Mil.</i> 178, and the note to the last section on nemittikā, and the story at <i>Mahāvaɱsa</i> 82.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> <i>Uppādo,</i> 'the portents of the great ones, thunderbolts falling, and so on,' says Buddhaghosa. The Great Ones here mean, I think, the spirits or gods presiding over the sun, moon, and planets (see the note on § 26). The word corresponds to the Sanskrit <i>Utpāta,</i> though the <i>d</i> is vouched for by overwhelming authority. But this is only another instance of a change not infrequent (as Ed. Müller has shown, Pāli Grammar, p. 37); and the one or two cases where Burmese scribes have (wrongly) corrected to <i>uppāta</i> is another instance to be added to those referred to in the Introduction to Sum. 1 of their habit of putting an easier reading where the more difficult one is really right. Childers should therefore have kept this word separate from the other <i>uppādo.</i> Comp. <i>Jāt.</i> 1, 374.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> <i>Supinaɱ.</i> On the theory of dreams compare <i>Mil.,</i> pp. 297-301. At <i>Jāt.</i> I, 374 the word is masculine. Perhaps charms to avert bad dreams (Ath.-veda VI, 46; XVI, 5 and 6) are included in this low art.' <i>Jāt.</i> No. 77 mocks at the dream interpreters.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> <i>Lakkhaṇaɱ.</i> The commentator on this word as used in the very same connection at <i>Jāt.</i> I, 374 adds that it means also the knowledge of good and bad marks on such persons and things as are mentioned here in our next paragraph. Buddhaghosa confines its meaning to that given above. This contradiction is another confirmation of the opinion expressed by me in 1880 in 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. lxiii foll., that Childers was wrong in ascribing the <i>Jātaka</i> Commentary to Buddhaghosa. The word occurs in Buddhaghosa's sense at <i>D.</i> I, 114, 120= <i>A.</i> 1, 163, etc.; <i>Jāt.</i> I, 56.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> <i>Musikācchinnaɱ.</i> The allied superstition of thinking it unlucky to wear clothes gnawed by mice is laughed out of court in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_87"><i>Maɱgala Jātaka</i>, No. 87.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> <i>Aggi-homaɱ.</i> Telling people that a sacrifice, if offered in a fire of such and such a wood, will have such and such a result.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> <i>Dabbi-homaɱ.</i> Telling people that an oblation of such and such grains, butter, or so on, poured into the fire from such and such a sort of spoon, will have such and such a result.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> See Hillebrandt, 'Neu und Vollmondsopfer,' pp. 31, 171, and Ritual-literatur' in Bühler's 'Grundriss,' pp. 71, 72, 114, 176. The nine homas here objected to may also be compared with the seven at Ath.-veda VIII, 9, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> No instance of this can be traced in the books of the Brahmans.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> Compare the passage in Hillebrandt, in Bühler's Grundriss,' p. 176, on the use of blood for sorcery. In one passage, Rig-vidh. III, 18, 3, it is one's own blood that is to be used. But the specific interpretation given here by Buddhaghosa cannot be paralleled from the Brahmanical books.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> Anga-vijja. Buddhaghosa thus separates this from the <i>aŋgaɱ</i> of No. 1. In both the passages <i>Jāt.</i> 11, 200, 250 the knowledge is simply that of judging from a man's appearance that he is rough or bad, and it is the good man in the story (in the second case the Bodisat himself) who is the <i>anga-vijjā-pāṭhako.</i> So at <i>Jāt.</i> V, 458 it is by anga-vijjā that the Bodisat prophesies that a man will be cruel.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> <i>Vatthu-vijjā.</i> Childers (<i>Dict.,</i> p. 559) has 'pool' instead of 'house,' having misread <i>sara</i> for <i>ghara</i> (<i>s</i> and <i>gh</i> are nearly alike in Sinhalese). The craft is further explained by Buddhaghosa in his comment on the <i>Mahā-parinibbāna</i> Sutta I, 26. Its success depended on the belief that the sites were haunted by spirits. See further below, § 27.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> <i>Khatta-vijjā.</i> The Burmese MSS. correct the rare <i>khatta</i> into the familiar <i>khetta. Khetta-vijjā</i> indeed occurs at <i>Ud.</i> III, 9, and may just possibly there (in connection with writing, arithmetic, tables, etc.) be correct in the meaning- of 'land-surveying, mensuration.' Buddhaghosa, though his explanation is corrupt, evidently understands the phrase in a sense similar to that of <i>khatta-dhamma</i> at <i>Jāt.</i> V, 489, 490; <i>Mil.</i> 164 (see also 178); and his gloss nītisatthaɱ is probably nearer the mark than Saŋkara's (on Chānd. Up. VII, 1, 2), which is dhanur-veda. It is the craft of government, then lying in great part in adhering to custom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Sutta only follows the Upanishad in looking at all these crafts as minor matters, but it goes beyond it in looking upon them as a 'low' way, for a Brahman, of gaining a livelihood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> <i>Siva-vijjā.</i> It is clear that <i>siva</i> is used euphemistically, and we may here have an early reference to what afterwards developed into the cult of the god Siva. Buddhaghosa gives an alternative explanation as knowledge of the cries of jackals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> <i>Bhūta-vijjā.</i> Also in the Chāndogya list (<i>loc. cit.</i>)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> <i>Bhūri-vijjā.</i> It is the same as <i>bhūri-kammaɱ,</i> explained in the same way by Buddhaghosa on § 27 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> <i>Ahi-vijjā.</i> One method is described at <i>Jāt.</i> IV, 457, 8, Perhaps such charms against snake-bite as Ath.-v. V,13 ; VI, 12, 56; VII, 88, are included.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says curing or giving poison, or poison spells (compare Ath.-v. VI, 90, 93, 100).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> These are explained to mean simply curing the bites of these creatures.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> Throughout these paragraphs the plural is used. This cannot be honorific, as the few great kings of that time are always spoken of in the singular. Yet all the previous translators, except Burnouf, translate by the singular - 'the king will march out,' etc. It is evident that we have to understand 'chiefs,' and not the 'king': and that not absolute monarchies, but republican institutions of a more or less aristocratic type, were in the mind of the composer of the paragraph.</p>

Burnouf has ('constellation,' but what can the eclipse of a constellation mean?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> Patha-gamana and uppatha-gamana. Prof. Kielhorn says (in a note he has been kind enough to send me on this section): What the author means by these words 1 do not know. But <i>uppatha-gamana</i> would be literally "aberration, the going away from one's proper path"; and <i>patha-gamana</i> therefore should be "following one's proper course." I am sure the two words could not mean conjunction and opposition; nor, I think, ascension and declension. It is curious that Buddhaghosa has not explained them.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup> Burnouf takes these four words to refer to four occurrences. Gogerly and Neumann take them as only two. Buddhaghosa seems to imply four.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> <i>Muddā.</i> There has been great diversity in the various guesses made at the meaning in this connection of <i>muddā,</i> which usually means 'seal' or 'seal-ring.' Gogerly has 'conveyancing,' and so also Childers; Burnouf takes this word and the next as one compound in the sense of foretelling the future by calculating diagrams'; and Neumann has 'Verwaltungsdienste,' administrative services. Buddhaghosa is very curt. He says only <i>hattha-muddāgaṇanā Hatthamuddā</i> is found elsewhere only at <i>Jāt.</i> III, 528, where <i>hattha-muddaɱ karoti</i> means 'to beckon,' and at <i>Vin.</i> V, 163, where it is said of the polite member of the Order that he makes, no sign with his hand, nor beckons. (On <i>hattha-vikāra</i> compare <i>Mil.</i> 1, 207, 547 = <i>Vin.</i> I,157 = <i>Vin.</i> II, 216.) Both these passages are much later than our text, and the sense of beckoning is here impossible. But muddā is mentioned as a craft at <i>Vin.</i> IV, 7 (where it is called honourable), at <i>M.</i> I, 85, and several times in the <i>Milinda</i> (pp. 3, 59, 78, 178 of the Pāli text), and <i>muddiko</i> as the person who practises that craft at <i>D.</i> I, 51 and <i>Vin.</i> IV, 8. The Sinhalese comment on this (quoted in my translation of the <i>Milinda,</i> 1, 91) shows that the art there was simply arithmetic, using the joints or knuckles of the fingers as an aid to memory. And this is no doubt the meaning in our paragraph.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> <i>Gaṇanā.</i> Buddhaghosa's comment on this is <i>acchiddakā-gaṇanā,</i> in contradistinction to the last. It is evidently calculation not broken up by using, the fingers, mental arithmetic pure and simple. The accountant who uses this method is called <i>gaṇako</i> (<i>D.</i> I, 51 ; <i>Vin.</i> IV, 8). Buddhaghosa's comment on the latter passage is given by Minayeff at <i>Pat.</i> 84, but with a wrong reading, akkhiɱṭaka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> <i>Saɱkhānaɱ,</i> literally 'counting up.' He who has the faculty of doing this can, on looking at a tree, say how many leaves it has, says Buddhaghosa. But the first words of his comment are doubtful. He may perhaps mean calculating masses by means of the rosary. Burnouf skips this word, and Neumann has simply 'counting.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> <i>Kāveyyaɱ.</i> The word recurs, in a bad sense, at <i>A.</i> 1, 72= III, 107, and also at <i>S.</i> I, 110 in the phrase <i>kāveyya-matto,</i> 'drunk with prophecy, inspired.' Buddhaghosa enumerates, in the words of <i>A.</i> II, 230, four kinds of poetry, and explains them in nearly the same words as found in the Manoratha Pūranī on that passage. None of the four refer to sacrificial hymns. Impromptu rhyming, ballad singing, and the composition of poems are meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> <i>Lokāhyataɱ.</i> Usually rendered 'materialism.' But it is quite clear that this meaning is impossible in this connection. See <i>Milinda</i> 174.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> Compare the Sinhalese <i>bīna (binna)</i> marriage in which the bridegroom is brought into the house of the bride's family.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> Compare the Sinhalese dīga marriage in which the bride is sent out to live in the bridegroom's family. We have no words now in English to express this difference between marrying and giving in marriage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a> - <a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a> - <a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a> - <a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a> ]</sup> <i>Saɱvadanaɱ.</i> Childers calls this a magic art, following Burnouf who calls it sorcery. Buddhaghosa explains it as astrology. The fact is all these expressions are technical terms for acts of astrology or sorcery, they none of them occur elsewhere either in Pāli or Sanskrit, and the tradition preserved by Buddhaghosa may be at fault in those cases in which the use of the word had not survived to later times. The general sense may be sufficiently clear, but for absolute certainty of interpretation we must wait till examples are found in Indian books of the actual use of the words, not in mere lists, but in a connection which shows the meaning. Ath-v III, 30 is a charm to secure concord in a family, compare VII, 52 ; and there are several charms in the Athara-veda for success in gambling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> Subhaga-karanaɱ. Many such charms are preserved in the Atharva-veda (for instance, X, 3:; 5; XVI, 4; 9)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> It would be useless to seek in the Atharva-veda, which (with the one exception mentioned in the notes to the next section) gives only the charms which are supposed to bring benefits, for instances of these malevolent practices. But we have here direct evidence that black magic, as was indeed inevitable was as fully trusted in the sixth century B. C. in the valley of the Ganges as white. We need not be surprised that the malevolent charms are not recorded.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> <i>Adāsa-pañho.</i> Buddhaghosa says they made a god appear in the mirror and answer questions put. It is a later conception to discard the god, and make the mirror itself give pictures of the hidden events. The mirror is of metal (Par. Dip. 235).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> <i>Kumāri-pañho.</i> Through a girl of good family and repute.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> <i>Deva-pañho.</i> Also obtained through a girl, but this time a <i>deva-dāsī</i> or temple prostitute. It is instructive to find, even under the patriarchal regime of the sixth century B. C., that men thought they could best have communications from the gods through the medium of a woman.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a>]</sup> <i>Ādiccupaṭṭhānam.</i> Such sun-worship is ridiculed in the <i>Jātaka</i> of the same name, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_173">No. 173.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains the Great One as Mahā Brahma. This seems to me very doubtful. It is at least odd to find Brahma introduced in this connection. We may grant that the Buddhists might have put sun-worship into a list of sorceries, but there was no ceremonial cult of Brahma and little or none of Brahmā. And however much the new gospel might hold the speculations of the dominant theosophy in contempt, that would scarcely explain their being ranked as privates in this regiment. Burnouf avoids this by rendering the phrase generally 'serving the great,' and Neumann has 'practising sorcery.' Neither of these guesses seems happy. <i>Mahat</i> in composition is elsewhere always <i>mahā</i> in Pāli, and we possibly have here a sandhi for <i>mahatī-upaṭṭhānam,</i> in the sense of worship of the Great Mother, the Earth, with covert allusion to <i>Mahī.</i> This would give excellent sense, as the worship of the Mother Earth was closely associated in the popular mind with witchcraft. A god or goddess is certainly meant, and one so associated would be best in place here. It is perhaps worthy of note that in the oldest portion of the Taittirīya Upanishad, Sun, Moon, Earth, and Srī occur together in a set of mystic groups, and Sun, Moon, Brahma, and food are all identified by a word-play with Mahas (Sīkrā-vallī 4-7).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n133" href="#fn133">133</a>]</sup> See <i>Milinda</i> 191, and <i>Jāt.</i> II, 410.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> <i>Bhūri-kammaɱ.</i> Is this a place sacred to Mother Earth? The ceremony referred to is the carrying out of the <i>vijjā</i> or craft mentioned in the list at § 2 I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a> - <a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> <i>Vassa-</i> and <i>vossa-kammaɱ.</i> Morris discusses the etymology of these words, only found in this list, in the <i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1889, p. 208. The idea of the second is not, of course, castration, but making a man's desire to fail by a spell. Several such are preserved in the Atharva (IV, 4 ; VI, 1 0 1 to give virility ; VI, I 3 8 ; VII, 1 I 3 to cause impotence).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a> - <a id="n138" href="#fn138">138</a>]</sup> <i>Vatthu-kammaɱ</i> and <i>-parikiraṇaɱ.</i> These constitute the <i>vatthu-vijjā</i> of § 21.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> See <i>Mil.</i> I, 511 and the rules laid down in <i>'Vinaya Texts,</i> II 53-55.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup> The Buddhist view of Nos. 11-25 must not be mistaken. It is sufficiently clear from the numerous examples in the <i>Vinaya</i> (see especially <i>'Vinaya Texts,'</i> II, pp. 4I-I44), and from the high praise accorded to Jīvaka and other physicians, that the objection was to recluses and Brahmans practising medicine as a means of livelihood. They might do so gratis for themselves or for their coreligionists, and laymen might do so for gain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The use of <i>paṭimokkha</i> in No. 25 is curious. It is when, for instance, a purgative is first given and then a tonic to counteract the other, to set free from its effect. Compare Jāt. V, 25.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup> The corresponding Sanskrit terms occur at Divyāvadāna, p. 492. No doubt the reading there ought to be nipuṇo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n143" href="#fn143">143</a>]</sup> These phrases recur <i>S.</i> III, 45. On <i>anuddiṭṭhi</i> see also Gogerly in the, Ceylon Friend, 1875, p. 133, and Morris in the <i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1886, p. 113; and compare , <i>attānuddiṭṭhi</i> at Mil. 146, 160, 352 S. N. 1119. As in our colloquial expression a 'viewy man,' <i>diṭṭhi</i> almost always, and <i>anudiṭṭhi</i> in all the seven passages where it occurs, have a connotation of contempt-a mere view, an offhand ill-considered opinion, a delusion. The Greek greak δόξα has had a similar history, and dogma or speculation is a better rendering than view or belief.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> <i>Sassata-vādā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n145" href="#fn145">145</a>]</sup> <i>Gotra,</i> literally 'cow-stall.' The history of this word has yet to be written. It probably meant at the time this Sutta was written a family or lineage traced through the father. On the meaning of <i>gotraja</i> (the gentiles of Roman Law) in the later law-books see West and Bühler, 'Hindu Law of Inheritance,' p.17 I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n146" href="#fn146">146</a>]</sup> <i>Vaṇṇa,</i> literally 'colour.' Gogerly renders it 'appearance,' and Neumann 'Beruf.' I have chosen caste (though it is not caste in its strictest sense) because it no doubt refers to the <i>cattāro vaṇṇā</i> mentioned so often in the Suttas. It is true that these-Khattiyas, Brahmans, Vessas, and Suddas-were not castes, but four divisions of the people, each consisting of many subdivisions (by customs as to connubium and commensality) which afterwards hardened into castes. See <i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1897, PP. 180-190.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n147" href="#fn147">147</a>]</sup> <i>Saɱvaṭṭa-vivaṭṭaɱ</i> (rolling up and evolution, from vaṭṭ, to turn). It is the period of the gradual disintegration and conformation of a world. Needless to add that the length of this period cannot be expressed in figures.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Neither the idea nor the word occurs in books known to be before the Buddha. But both are Indian rather than Buddhist. <i>Saɱvarta</i> is found in the Mahā Bhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa; and the later Sāŋkhya notion of <i>pralaya</i> is closely allied.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n152" href="#fn152">152</a>]</sup> Gogerly (PP. 77, 78 in Grimblot) has made a sad mess of this paragraph misunderstanding the grammatical construction of the first clause, and misinterpreting <i>parāmasati</i> in the second, and <i>nissaranaɱ</i> in the third.</p>

The story was a favourite one, and three recessions of it have been preserved (<i>M.</i> I, 326-331; <i>S.</i> I, 142-144, and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_405"><i>Jāt.</i> No. 405</a>). Mr. Crow evidently considered himself the Mahā Brahmā of the period.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The omission in the Dialogue of all reference to the Kesava Birth Story may be a sign of greater age or it may be due simply to the fact that it is not required for the argument there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n156" href="#fn156">156</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa on this has a curious note. The gods, though of great glory, are delicate in body. A man, having gone without food for seven days even, may restore his strength by the use of clear broth and so on. But the gods can't play tricks with themselves; and if they lose their heads and forget their meal-times, they die - pass away from that state. The poor gods! Whether this be really implied in the text or not, it is at least in harmony with the irony of the Buddha's talk.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n157" href="#fn157">157</a>]</sup> <i>Mano-padosikā.</i> Only found here and in the list in the <i>Samaya Sutta.</i> Even there it is almost certainly merely taken from this passage, so that it looks very much as if both these classes or titles of gods were simply invented, in irony, for the sake of the argument. Buddhaghosa identifies this class with the retinue of the four Great Kings - that is the regents of the four quarters.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n158" href="#fn158">158</a>]</sup> <i>Upanijjhāyanti,</i> from <i>jhāyati,</i> to burn. Elsewhere found only at <i>Vin.</i> 1, 193; II, 269; 111, 118, in all which passages it has the connotation of 'covet, lust after.' Buddhaghosa takes it here in the sense of envy, and tells a tale, too long to quote, to show the quarrelsome nature of these gods. In the sense of 'consider' (from <i>jhāyati,</i> to think) the word has only been found at <i>S.N.,</i> p. 143. There may have been confusion between the two homonyms, so that ours got to mean to consider in such a way as to be excited, to burn.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n159" href="#fn159">159</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains that these speculators perceive how the organs of sense break up (and sense impressions pass away); but they fail to see that the same thing holds even more strongly in the case of thoughts, since no sooner has each mental impression given rise to the succeeding one than it passes away. Not perceiving that, and depending on the analogy of birds, who fly away from one tree only to alight on another, they conclude that the mind, when this individuality is broken up, goes (as a unity) elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup> According to Buddhaghosa (Ats. 160) there are four things that are infinite - space, the number of world-systems, the number of living creatures, and the wisdom of a Buddha. Had this doctrine formed part of the original Buddhism we should expect to find these <i>cattāri-anantāni</i> in the chapter on the 'Fours' in the <i>Aŋguttara,</i> but I do not find them there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n163" href="#fn163">163</a>]</sup> Either in self-training or in the attainment of bliss in heaven' says Buddhaghosa (p.115).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n164" href="#fn164">164</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa gives examples of these five equivocations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains that if, in his ignorance, he should, by chance, declare the good to be good, he will be puffed up by the approval of the wise. But if he should blunder, he will be filled with vexation and illwill when his error is pointed out. Either of these states of mind will be the fuel to keep the fire burning, the state technically called Upādāna, 'grasping.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup> Such questions are called elsewhere the common basis of discussions among Brahmans.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup> The word here used is <i>Tathāgata,</i> 'he who has gone, or perhaps come, to the truth.'

The use of <i>sammaggato</i> (<i>D.</i> I, 55, etc.) and of <i>gatatto</i> (<i>D.</i> I, 57, etc.) shows that <i>gata</i> was used elliptically in the sense of 'gone to the furthest point aimed at' among the followers of the other sects that arose at the same time as Buddhism. The exact derivation and history of the word <i>Tathāgata</i> may be doubtful, but its meaning is, on the whole, clear enough.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup> This is the identical answer put below (p. 57 of the text) into the mouth of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta.</p>

It is there associated with words meaning neither self-originated, nor created by others.' It is explained by Buddhaghosa on our passage (<i>Sum.</i> I, 118) as 'springing up without a cause.' The derivation is doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup> <i>Asañña-sattā.</i> They spring into being in this wise. Some one of the Brahman ascetics having practised continual meditation and arrived at the Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>, sees the disadvantage attached to thinking, and says to himself: 'It is by dwelling on it in thought that physical pain and all sorts of mental terrors arise. Have done with this thinking. An existence without it were better.' And dying in this belief he is reborn among the Unconscious Ones, who have form only, and neither sensations nor ideas nor predispositions nor consciousness. So long as the power of the <i>Jhāna</i> lasts, so long do they last. Then an idea occurs to them - the idea of rebirth in this world - and they straightway die.</p>

These summary epithets are meant to be contemptuous, and the word chosen for death adds to the force of the phrase.

It appears from <i>M.</i> I, 164 that this was pretty much the view put forth by Gotama's first teacher Ālāra Kālāma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n179" href="#fn179">179</a>]</sup> Compare the 5th Vimokha. This seems from <i>M.</i> I 165 to have been much the same as the view held by Rāma, whose son and pupil, Uddaka, was Gotama's second teacher.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n181" href="#fn181">181</a>]</sup> Though it is not explicitly so stated, this last of these seven theorisers is no doubt to be considered as believing in all the sorts of soul held by the others, so that he believes in seven. One may compare the five souls each more subtle than the last, made respectively of <i>anna, prāṇa, manas, vijñāṇa,</i> and <i>ānanda</i> (food, breadth, mind, consciousness, and joy), described in the Taittirīya Upanishad II, 1-5. The Buddhist modification of these 'theories omits the souls, and treats instead of various states of mind (produced by stages of meditation), the attainment of which, during this life, leads to rebirth in corresponding worlds, or planes of existence, named after those stages. of meditations. But the oldest Piṭaka texts say very little about it, and the history of Buddhist speculation on the matter has yet to be formulated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Centuries afterwards we find a somewhat analogous conception in the gradually ascending series of seven, each more subtle than the last (<i>Sthūla-sarīra, 'iŋga-sarīra, indriya, manas, ahaŋkara, buddhi, and ātman</i>), set out in the Sāŋkhya texts, and the later Vedanta has a similar series. There is sufficient truth in the idea of the series of seven set out in our text to explain the persistence of the general idea in all the Indian systems, but the details and the application are strikingly different.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The text shows that the four <i>Arūpa Vimokhas</i> of the Buddhist theory were regarded by the early Buddhists as derived from closely allied speculations, older than Buddhism, and expressed in almost identical phraseology.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n182" href="#fn182">182</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa here (<i>Sum.</i> 1, 121) explains Nirvāṇa. as the suppression of pain; pain, <i>dukkha,</i> being bodily, as opposed to <i>domanassa,</i> mental. 'In this visible world' means in whatever world the particular soul happens to be at the time. On <i>parikāreti</i> compare V. II, 290 <i>rājā uyyāne paricāresi,</i> 'the king indulged himself, enjoyed himself, in the garden. 'All its functions' is added from the Commentary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n183" href="#fn183">183</a>]</sup> The text shows that the four <i>Jhānas</i> were regarded by the early Buddhists as older than Buddhism. The very words used are identical; the only modification introduced in Buddhism being the omission of the 'souls.' These four, together with the four <i>Arūpa Vimokhas</i> (see note on § 19), make up the Eight Attainments (<i>Samāpattiyo</i>), often mentioned in the <i>Jātaka</i> commentary as practised by pre Buddhistic recluses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n184" href="#fn184">184</a>]</sup> On <i>paritasita</i> compare <i>M.</i> 1, 36 <i>na asati paritassati,</i> 'is not worried at what is not': <i>paritasita,</i> 'fidgetiness' or 'worry,' at <i>M.</i> 1, 136; <i>S.</i> III, 15-19; and <i>Mil.</i> 253, 400. On <i>vipphandita,</i> M. I, 8, 486; Dh. S. 381 (Asl. 253); Jāt. IV, 495.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n185" href="#fn185">185</a>]</sup> In the text the first three of these four propositions are repeated of each of the eleven classes of theorisers. 'The fourth is put in the form which, to avoid repetition, I have adopted for all the four.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n186" href="#fn186">186</a>]</sup> <i>Tathāgata,</i> that is the speaker himself, the Buddha.</p>
