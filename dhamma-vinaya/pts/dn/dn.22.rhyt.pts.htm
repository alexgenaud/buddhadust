					<h4><a id="Intro">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The doctrine here expounded is perhaps the most important, after that of the Aryan Path, in early Buddhism; and this tract, the oldest authoritative statement of the doctrine, is still in frequent and popular use among those Buddhists who have adhered to the ancient faith.</p>

					<p>The two doctrines are closely connected. The exposition here of mindfulness (Sati) includes that of the Path, and no exposition of the Path is complete without he inclusion of mindfulness. Whosoever neglects the fourfold practice of mindfulness he misses the Path, whosoever practices mindfulness has found the Path (<i>Saɱyutta</i> V, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.47.033.wood.pts.htm">179, 180,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.52.001.wood.pts.htm">294</a>). The right way to the practice of mindfulness is precisely the Aryan Path <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm#p40">(ibid. 183).</a> And that practice is in turn, in one passage, called the Path to the Unconditioned (Asamkhata, that is, Arahantship, Nirvana, the goal of the Aryan Path).<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>What then is this Mindfulness?</p>

					<p>This Suttanta will show. But a few observations may help the student of it. Etymologically Sati is Memory. But as happened at the rise of Buddhism to so many other expressions in common use, a new connotation was then attached to the word, a connotation that gave a new meaning to it, and renders 'memory' a most inadequate and misleading translation. It became the memory, recollection, calling-to-mind, being-aware-of, certain specified facts. Of these the most important was the impermanence (the coming to be as the result of a cause, and the passing away again) of all phenomena, bodily and mental. And it included the repeated application of this awareness, to each experience of life, from the ethical point of view. 'Thus does he cultivate those qualities which ought to be practiced, and not those which ought not. That is how repetition is the mark of Mindfulness,' says Nāgasena<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, in complete accord with our Suttanta.</p>

					<p><a id="pg323"><span class="f2 g"><b>[323]</b></span></a> When Christians are told: 'Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,' [Ed.: 1 Corinthians 10:31] a way is shown by which any act, however lowly, can, by the addition of a remembrance (a <i>Sati</i>), be surrounded by the halo of a high moral enthusiasm; and how, by the continual practice of this remembrance, a permanent improvement in character can be obtained. The Buddhist idea is similar. But the remembrance is of what we should now call natural law, not of a deity. This has been made a corner-stone of the system of ethical self-training. The corresponding cornerstone in the West is conscience; and indeed, so close is the resemblance in their effects that one scholar has chosen 'conscience' as a rendering of <i>Sati;</i> — wrongly, we think, as this introduces a Western idea into Buddhism. The curious notion of an internal monitor, distinct from the soul, yet speaking independently of the will of the man himself, is confined to animistic modes of thought. Buddhaghosa uses it, indeed, as a simile, to explain the connotations of <i>Sati;</i> but he expressly pours scorn on any idea of a separate entity.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>On the other hand though <i>Sati</i> ([Skt.:] <i>Smṛti</i>) does not occur in any ethical sense in pre-Buddhistic literature, it is possible that the Buddhist conception was, in one way, influenced by previous thought. Stress is laid in the <i>Upanishad</i> ideal on Intuition, especially as regards the relation between the soul, supposed to exist inside each human body, and the Great Soul. In the Buddhist protest against this, the doctrine of <i>Sati,</i> dependent not on intuition, but on grasp of actual fact, plays an important part. This opposition may have been intentional. On the other hand, the ethical value of Mindfulness (in its technical sense) would be sufficient, without any such intention, to explain the great stress laid upon it.</p>

					<p>The other word in the compound that gives the title to this Suttanta is <i>Paṭṭhāna</i> — which would mean etymologically 'putting forward, setting forth.' It does not occur in pre-Buddhistic literature. It has not been yet found in the <i>Nikāyas</i> in its concrete, primary, sense; or in any connexion except this. Buddhaghosa here paraphrases it, exegetically only, by <i>gocara,</i> which is the feeding-ground, resort, of an animal [pasture]. The mediaeval use of the word (in its Sanskrit form) was in the sense of starting off, going away, departure. It is the title of the most often quoted book in the <i>Abhidhamma,</i> and there means probably Origins, Starting-points, as it gives under twenty-four categories the <i>paccayas</i> (causes) of phenomena. In one passage of a fifth-century commentator (<i>Jat.</i> I, 78.-5) the <i>Abhidhamma Piṭak</i>a as a whole is said to be <i>samanta-paṭṭhāna,</i> 'having (or giving) the settings-on-foot, the points of departure, of all things.' Childers gives the word as a neuter. It is masculine throughout our Suttanta. But he analyses the compound (<i>sub voce</i> <i>uppaṭṭhānam</i>), not into <i>Sati+paṭṭhāna,</i> but into <i>Sati+upaṭṭhāna.</i> This is a possible contraction, and Buddhaghosa gives it as an alternative explanation which he does not adopt. Had we adopted it, the rendering of the title would have been 'The getting-ready of Mindfulness.' Neumann renders it 'Pillars of Insight,' and Warren 'Intent Contemplations.' Neither of these is much more than a distant cousin of the Pāli.</p>

					<p>It is not easy at first sight to understand the choice of just those four fields of areas (comp. <i>paṭṭhāna = thānā = gocarā</i>), to which, in this Suttanta, 'mindfulness' is to be applied, or in respect to which it is to be set up. We need ourselves to be mindful, lest, in interpreting them, we follow too closely European points of view. In trying to avoid this danger, we do not consider our choice of terms leaves nothing to be desired, or to be explained.</p>

					<p>The ethical desirableness of <i>Sati,</i> as the instrument most efficacious in self-mastery, lay in the steady alertness of inward vision which it connoted, whether past or present experience was contemplated. In discussing it, the Buddhist was concerned, not with the outer world as such, but with the microcosm of his subjective experience, and with the vehicles thereof — sense and mind. These he is here represented as considering under the fourfold aspect of —</p>

					<p class="in1"><a id="pg325"><span class="f2 g"><b>[325]</b></span></a> (1) <i>kaya,</i> physical structure and activities<br />
					(2) <i>vedana,</i> the emotional nature, first as bare feeling, then as having ethical implications<br />
					(3) <i>citta,</i> conscious life, consciousness or intelligence, considered under ethical aspects<br />
					(4) <i>Dhamma,</i> with its subdivisions —</p>

							<p class="in2">a. the Five Hindrances.<br />
							b. The Five Groups.<br />
							c. The Six Spheres of Sense.<br />
							d. The Seven Factors of Enlightenment,<br />
							e. The Four Aryan Truths.</p>

					<p>Now it is always difficult to make any English term coincide with either <i>Dhamma</i> or <i>dhammā.</i> Here, as elsewhere in Buddhist diction, it is chiefly the context that must be the guide to meaning. The Suttanta is a discipline — the supreme discipline — in ethical introspection. And in Buddhist introspective analysis, <i>dhammā</i> (elsewhere translatable now by 'things,' now by 'qualities') are, more especially, 'cognoscible objects.' These are related to <i>mano</i> (consciousness as apprehending), just as each kind of sense-object is related to one kind of sense-organ; thing-seen, for example, to sight. A cognoscible object is any presentation (German, <i>Vorstellung</i>), that has got beyond the stage of mere sensory re-action. It is an idea or perception in the wider sense used by Locke: — <i>'Whatsoever is the immediate object of perception, thought, or understanding.'</i> But neither cognoscible object, nor presentation, is a term which lends itself with sufficient simplicity and impressiveness to ethical homily. We have therefore decided to perpetuate the Lockean 'idea.'</p>

					<p>For the same reason we use 'thought' for <i>citta,</i> in preference to a term of more psychological precision; and we understand by 'thought', thinking, or knowing, or being intelligently conscious, and do not restrict the word to any special mode of cognition.</p>

					<p>Hence we get this distinction of aspects in (3) and (4): under <i>citta,</i> the ever-changing ever-active continuance of consciousness, or re-acting intelligence; under <i>dhammā,</i> those same activities considered objectively, as concrete states, procedure, content of consciousness,' as the psychologists phrase it. Under (3) we watch the agency as a whole, in its chameleon-like phases. Under (4) we take transverse cuttings, so to speak, of our subjective experience.</p>

					<p>It is interesting to note that Buddhaghosa, explaining the inclusion, under No. 4, of the Six Senses and the fivefold <i>Khandha</i> doctrine, says: — 'in contemplation of the body the Exalted One taught only the grasp of matter, in contemplation  <a id="pg326"><span class="f2 g"><b>[326]</b></span></a> of feeling and consciousness, only the grasp of the immaterial. Now in order to teach grasp of matter and the immaterial mixed <i>(rūpārūpamissakapariggaho),</i> he spoke of <i>dhammā.</i> And again: 'grasp of the <i>rūpa-khanda</i> being taught by contemplation of body, and grasp of the <i>khandhas</i> of feeling and <i>viññāṇa</i> (cognition or consciousness) by contemplation of feeling and <i>citta,</i> He now, to teach grasp of the <i>khandhas</i> of perception and <i>saṅkhāra</i> (let us say, volition and other mental factors) went on to speak of <i>dhammā.</i></p>

							<p class="f2">Suffering. 'Suffering' for physical 'dukkha' has a problem: there can be pain without suffering. The Pali here is 'dukikha' above translated 'pain'. If anything physical dukkha would be better for physical pain and 'suffering' for the general category. Better still would be using 'pain' for both as that would reveal the meaning of both. There is physical pain and pains of other sorts: mental and existential.</p>

							There is a place for these, but it is not here, and this is to take the Pali and completely reverse the intent from that of abstaining from a bad thing to aspiring to a good thing. This is contra-method! You must try to understand this distinction! There is no ending kamma or rebirth by 'doing'. These things are good to do, make good kamma; but they do not end kamma.

The particular kind meant is kept tied up with string at both ends, and either end can be opened. The word only occurs in this connexion (here, and at <i>M.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.010.pali.bd.htm#pg57">I. 57;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.119.pali.bd.htm#pg90">III 90</a>).

That would show that when that title was first used the <i>Majjhima</i> recension was already known. It would not follow that the <i>Dīgha</i> is younger than the <i>Majjhima;</i> they may have been edited at the same time from older material.<br />
					The <i>Dīgha</i> addition is interesting as containing a fragment of Old Commentary (as old as the texts) of which other fragments are found in the <i>Nikāyas,</i> and also in the <i>Vinaya.</i><br />
					<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>The Vibhanga</i></a> (99-106) quotes this Dīgha addition verbatim.</p>

One might, therefore, express this central thought of the first Aryan truth in modern Western language by saying that pain is involved in individuality — a most pregnant and far reaching suggestion. The rest of the Truth is merely a statement of facts universally admitted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Sañjāti</i> only found elsewhere as yet <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg227"><i>Dīgha</i> I, 227,</a> where it means the produce arising out of an estate and accruing to the landlord.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>Vibhava.</i> This word usually means power, prosperity, success — the prefix <i>vi</i> being used as an intensitive particle. In this particular connexion the traditional interpretation takes the prefix in a negative sense, and paraphrases the word by 'the absence of becoming <i>(bhava).'</i> This view is apparently supported by some <i>Nikāya</i> passages (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.055.pali.bd.htm#pg57">S. III, 57;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p49">It. no. 49</a>), and by the <i>Dhamma Saṅgaṇī</i> 1314. But it may be derived from them; and it is odd that the word should have been found nowhere else in that sense. It is quite possible that the original sense was the usual one. At <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v282"><i>Dhp.</i> 282</a> it seems to mean decline in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Nekkhamma.</i> Burnouf (<i>'Lotus,'</i> 334) derives this word from <i>nis+karma;</i> Oldenberg (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>'Vinaya Texts,'</i></a> I, 104) from <i>nis+kāma,</i> and Childers (<i>sub voce</i>) from <i>nis+kramya</i>. These three derivations would give the meaning respectively as having no Karma, being devoid of lust, and going forth from home. Daraminpola explains it here as meaning either the second or the third. No doubt Oldenberg is right as to the derivation. But Daramiṭipola is also right if we take his note as exegetical, not philological. The fact is that the derivation had been, from very early times, forgotten or confused; and the connotation of the word was renunciation generally, with special reference to these two kinds. It never had anything to do with Karma.<br />
