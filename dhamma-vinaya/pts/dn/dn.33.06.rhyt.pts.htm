The second and third occasions are those of kindly speech and kind thoughts. In the next place, when a brother who has honestly and righteously obtained gifts, distributes these impartially among his fellow-disciples, and has everything in common with them, even to the contents of his alms-bowl, that is an occasion of fraternity, etc. Next, when the character and moral habits of a brother are <a id="pg232"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span></a> without rupture or flaw, are consistently practised, unblemished, making a man free, commended by the wise, unperverted, and conducing to rapt concentration,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> and he, so virtuous, <a id="pt246" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg246"><span class="f2">[246]</span></a> dwells openly and privately among his fellow-disciples, that is an occasion of fraternity, causing affection and regard, and conducing to concord, absence of strife, harmony, union.

Herein, friends, take a brother who gets angry and cherishes rancour, and in this mood becomes irreverent and insolent toward the Master, the Norm, the Order, and does not accomplish the training. Such an one stirs up contention in the Order, and that contention is fraught with ill and misery for multitudes, with disadvantage, ill and sorrow for devas and men. If you, friends, should discern such a root of contention among yourselves or in other communities, then should ye strive to get just that evil root of contention eliminated. And if ye do not discern any such root, so work that it may not come to overwhelm you in the future. Such is the eliminating, suchis the future averting of that evil root of contention. The other five roots of contention are (2) when a brother conceals other's good deeds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and is hypocritical ... (3) is envious and mean ... (4) is deceitful and crafty ... (5) is full of evil wishes and false opinions ... <a id="pt247" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg247"><span class="f2">[247]</span></a> (6) is infatuated with his own opinion, clutching it tenaciously and is loth to renounce it.</p>

Herein, friends, a brother might say: 'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation by love, <a id="pt248" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg248"><span class="f2">[248]</span></a>I have multiplied it, made it a vehicle, and a base. I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless malevolence persistently possesses my heart.' To him it should be said: 'Not so! Say not so, your reverence! Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend. Things cannot be as you say. Emancipation of the heart through love, brother, this is how you become delivered from malevolence. In the same way a brother might wrongly complain that after cultivating emancipation of the heart through pity, he was still possessed by cruelty, or that after cultivating emancipation of the heart through sympathetic joy, or through equanimity, he was still possessed by disgust, and passion respectively. <a id="pt249" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg249"><span class="f2">[249]</span></a> Next, friends, a brother might say: 'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation from the power of any object to catch the fancy and incite lust,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> I have multiplied that emancipation, made it a vehicle and a base I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless my mind still pursues seductive objects. Or again he may say: 'Lo! the notion "I am" is offensive to me! I pay no heed to the notion "This 'I' exists!" Nevertheless doubts and queries and debating<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> still possess my mind.' To these answer should be made as before. He should be assured that such cannot really be the case; that it is by emancipating the heart through equanimity, or again, through the expulsion of the conceit of the <a id="pg234"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></a> existence of an 'I,' that he becomes delivered from lust <a id="pt250" href="../../pali/dn/dn.33.03.pali.bd.htm#pg250"><span class="f2">[250]</span></a> and from doubts and queries and debatings.</p>
