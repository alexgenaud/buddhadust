					when a brother's kind thoughts towards his fellow-disciples has been attested, as wrought publicly and in private, that is an occasion of fraternity, causing affection and regard, and conducing to concord, absence of strife, harmony, union.<br />

And if ye do not discern any such root, so work that it may not come to overwhelm you in the future. Such is the eliminating, such is the future averting of that evil root of contention.<br />
					(2) When a brother conceals other's good deeds,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and is hypocritical, and in this mood becomes irreverent and insolent toward the Master, the Norm, the Order, and does not accomplish the training.

					(6) When a brother is infatuated with his own opinion, clutching it tenaciously and is loth to renounce it, and in this mood becomes irreverent and insolent toward the Master, the Norm, the Order, and does not accomplish the training. Such an one stirs up contention in the Order, and that contention is fraught with ill and misery for multitudes, with disadvantage, ill and sorrow for devas and men.

Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend. Things cannot be as you say. Emancipation of the heart through love, brother, this is how you become delivered from malevolence.<br />
					In the same way a brother might say: 'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation of the heart through pity, I have multiplied it, made it a vehicle, and a base. I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless cruelty persistently possesses my heart.' To him it should be said: 'Not so! Say not so, your reverence! Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend.

					In the same way a brother might say: 'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation of the heart through sympathetic joy, I have multiplied it, made it a vehicle, and a base. I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless disgust persistently possesses my heart.' To him it should be said: 'Not so! Say not so, your reverence! Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend. Things cannot be as you say. Emancipation of the heart through sympathetic joy, brother, this is how you become delivered from disgust.<br />
					In the same way a brother might say: 'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation of the heart through equanimity, I have multiplied it, made it a vehicle, and a base. I have brought it out, accumulated and set it well going. Nevertheless passion persistently possesses my heart.' To him it should be said: 'Not so! Say not so, your reverence! Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend.

It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One! Surely he would not say this was so! This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend. Things cannot be as you say. Mental emancipation from the power of any object to catch the fancy and incite lust, brother, this is how you become delivered from seductive objects.<br />
					Or again he may say: 'Lo! the notion "I am" is offensive to me! I pay no heed to the notion "This 'I' exists!" Nevertheless doubts and queries and debating<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> still possess my mind.' To these answer should be made as before.
