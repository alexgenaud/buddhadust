					<p>[This Sutta having been incorporated, word for word, as <a href="dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#p15">§§ 15-19,</a> inclusive, in <a href="dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm">the last Sutta,</a> the reader is referred to the translation given there. [Ed. reproduced here.]</p>

					<p>The Mahāli Sutta must have already included, when the Dīgha was put together, this Jāliya episode. For there would otherwise be no reason for the Mahāli Sutta being put into the Sīlakkhanda Vagga, the Sīlas being contained only in that episode.</p>

					<p>Why then should the episode appear also again, in full, as a separate Sutta? Is it merely because of the importance of the question? We have another instance of a similar kind, where the episode of Nigrodha's question, only referred to at § 23 of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p8">Kassapa-Sīhanāda Sutta,</a> is set out afterwards, in full, in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p25">Udumbarīka Sīhanāda Sutta</a> (No. 25 in the Dīgha). But there the whole episode is not given twice in full. Such cross-references are fairly frequent in the <i>Piṭakas,</i> and are of importance for the history of the literature. One of the most striking cases is where the <i>Saṃyutta</i> quotes a Sutta, now contained in the <i>Dīgha,</i> by name. (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p21"><i>Sakkapañha Sutta,</i></a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.004.pali.bd.htm#pg13"><i>S.</i> III, 13;</a> compare <i>Sum.</i> I, 51; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm"><i>Mil.</i></a> 350.)]</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One was once staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī,</a><br />
					in the Ghosita pleasaunce.</p>

					<p class="f4">There two recluses,<br />
					Maṇḍissa the wandering mendicant,<br />
					and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattika<br />
					(the man with the wooden bowl),<br />
					came to The Blessed One,<br />
					and exchanged, with him<br />
					the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and stood reverently apart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so standing they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it then, O venerable Gotama,<br />
					is the soul the same thing as the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or is the soul one thing<br />
					and the body, another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Listen then, Sirs,<br />
					and give heed attentively,<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, Sir,"<br />
					said those two mendicants in assent,<br />
					and The Blessed One spake as follows: —</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, Sirs,<br />
					there appears in the world<br />
					one who has won the truth, an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy,<br />
					who knows all worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One,<br />
					a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face this universe,<br />
					— including the worlds above of the gods,<br />
					the Brahmas, and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples, —<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />
					doth he proclaim,<br />
					both in the spirit and in the letter,<br />
					the higher life doth he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or one of his children,<br />
					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the Tathāgata (the one who has found the truth);<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has thus become a recluse<br />
					he lives self-restrained by that restraint that should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight,<br />
					and he sees danger<br />
					in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure are his means of livelihood,<br />
					good is his conduct,<br />
					guarded the doors of his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he is altogether happy.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Sirs, is his conduct good?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this, Sirs, that the Bhikshu,<br />
					putting away the killing of living things,<br />
					holds aloof from the destruction of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The cudgel and the sword he has laid aside,<br />
					and ashamed of roughness,<br />
					and full of mercy,<br />
					he dwells compassionate and kind<br />
					to all creatures that have life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the taking<br />
					of what has not been given,<br />
					he lives aloof from grasping<br />
					what is not his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes only what is given,<br />
					and expecting that gifts will come,<br />
					he passes his life in honesty<br />
					and purity of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away unchastity,<br />
					he is chaste.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof,<br />
					far off from the vulgar practice,<br />
					from the sexual act.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away lying words,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from falsehood.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks truth,<br />
					from the truth he never swerves;<br />
					faithful and trustworthy,<br />
					he breaks not his word to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away slander,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from calumny.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he hears here<br />
					he repeats not elsewhere<br />
					to raise a quarrel<br />
					against the people here;<br />
					what he hears elsewhere<br />
					he repeats not here<br />
					to raise a quarrel<br />
					against the people there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he live as a binder together<br />
					of those who are divided,<br />
					an encourager of those who are friends,<br />
					a peacemaker,<br />
					a lover of peace,<br />
					impassioned for peace,<br />
					a speaker of words that make for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away rudeness of speech,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from harsh language.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever word is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the car,<br />
					lovely,<br />
					reaching to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasing to the people,<br />
					beloved of the people -<br />
					such are words he speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away frivolous talk,<br />
					he holds himself aloof from vain conversation.</p>

					<p class="f4">In season he speaks,<br />
					in accordance with the facts,<br />
					words full of meaning,<br />
					on religion,<br />
					on the discipline of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks, and at the right time,<br />
					words worthy to be laid up in one's heart,<br />
					fitly illustrated,<br />
					clearly divided,<br />
					to the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof<br />
					from causing injury to seeds or plants.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					not eating at night,<br />
					refraining from food after hours<br />
					(after midday).</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from being a spectator<br />
					at shows at fairs,<br />
					with nautch dances,<br />
					singing, and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from wearing,<br />
					adorning,<br />
					or ornamenting himself<br />
					with garlands, scents, and unguents.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from the use<br />
					of large and lofty beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting silver or gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting uncooked grain.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting raw meat.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting women or girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting bondmen or bondwomen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting sheep or goats.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting fowls or swine.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle. horses, and mares.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from accepting cultivated fields or waste.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from acting as a go-between or messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from buying and selling.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from cheating<br />
					with scales or bronzes or measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from the crooked ways<br />
					of bribery, cheating, and fraud.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from maiming,<br />
					murder,<br />
					putting in bonds,<br />
					highway robbery,<br />

					and violence.</p>

					as if there were a deep pool,<br />
					with water welling up into it<br />
					from a spring beneath,<br />
					and with no inlet from the east or west,<br />
					from the north or south,<br />
					and the god should not<br />
					from time to time<br />
					send down showers of rain upon it.<br />
					Still the current of cool waters<br />
					rising up from that spring<br />
					would pervade,<br />
					fill,<br />
					permeate,<br />
					and suffuse the pool<br />
					with cool waters,<br />
					and there would be no part or portion of the pool<br />
					unsuffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Sirs, when a Bhikshu knows thus and sees thus,<br />
					would that make him ready to take up the subject:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the soul the same thing as the body,<br />
					or is the soul one thing and the body another?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, it would, Sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, Sirs, know thus and see thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And nevertheless I do not say either the one or the other.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Sirs, the Bhikshu,<br />
					holding aloof from joy,<br />
					becomes equable;<br />
					and mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he experiences in his body<br />
					that ease which the Arahats talk of when they say:<br />
					"The man serene and self-possessed<br />
					is well at ease,"<br />
					and so he enters into<br />
					and abides in the Third Jhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And his very body<br />
					does he so pervade,<br />
					drench,<br />
					permeate,<br />
					and suffuse with that ease<br />
					that has no joy with it,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Sirs,<br />
					as when in a lotus tank<br />
					the several lotus flowers,<br />
					red or white or blue,<br />
					born in the water,<br />
					grown up in the water,<br />
					not rising up above the surface of the water,<br />
					drawing up nourishment from the depths of the water,<br />
					are so pervaded,<br />
					drenched,<br />
					permeated,<br />
					and suffused<br />
					from their very tips<br />
					down to their roots<br />
					with the cool moisture thereof,<br />
					that there is no spot in the whole plant,<br />
					whether of the red lotus,<br />
					or of the white,<br />
					or of the blue,<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Sirs, when a Bhikshu knows thus and sees thus, would that make him ready to take up the subject:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the soul the same thing as the body,<br />
					or is the soul one thing and the body another?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, it would, Sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, Sirs, know thus and see thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And nevertheless I do not say either the one or the other.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Sirs, the Bhikshu,<br />
					by the putting away alike of ease and of pain,<br />
					by the passing away alike of any elation,<br />
					any dejection,<br />
					he had previously felt,<br />
					enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna,<br />
					a state of pure self-possession and equanimity,<br />
					without pain and without ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sits there<br />
					so suffusing even his body<br />
					with that sense of purification,<br />
					of translucence of heart,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Sirs,<br />
					as if a man were sitting<br />
					so wrapt from head to foot in a clean white robe,<br />
					that there were no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not in contact with the clean white robe<br />
					— just so, Sirs, does the Bhikshu sit there,<br />
					so suffusing even his body<br />
					with that sense of purification,<br />
					of translucence of heart,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Sirs, when a Bhikshu knows thus and sees thus, would that make him ready to take up the subject:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the soul the same thing as the body,<br />
					or is the soul one thing and the body another?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, it would, Sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, Sirs, know thus and see thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And nevertheless I do not say either the one or the other."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he applies and bends down his mind<br />
					to that insight that comes from knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grasps the fact:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body of mine has form,<br />
					it is built up of the four elements,<br />
					it springs from father and mother,<br />
					it is continually renewed<br />
					by so much boiled rice and juicy foods,<br />
					its very nature is impermanence,<br />
					it is subject to erasion,<br />
					abrasion,<br />
					dissolution,<br />
					and disintegration;<br />
					and therein is this consciousness of mine, too, bound up,<br />
					on that does it depend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Sirs,<br />
					as if there were a veluriya gem,<br />
					bright, of the purest water,<br />
					with eight facets,<br />
					excellently cut,<br />
					clear, translucent,<br />
					without a flaw,<br />
					excellent in every way.<br />
					And through it a string,<br />
					blue, or orange-coloured,<br />
					or red, or white, or yellow<br />
					should be threaded.<br />
					If a man, who had eyes to see,<br />
					were to take it into his hand,<br />
					he would clearly perceive<br />
					how the one is bound up with the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Sirs, when a Bhikshu knows thus and sees thus,<br />
					would that make him ready to take up the subject:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the soul the same thing as the body,<br />
					or is the soul one thing and the body another?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, it would, Sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I, Sirs, know thus and see thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And nevertheless I do not say either the one or the other.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he directs and bends down his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the destruction of the Deadly Floods.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the Path that leads to the cessation of pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as they really are:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These are the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the Path that leads to the cessation of the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, thus knowing, thus seeing,<br />
					the heart is set free<br />
					from the Deadly Taint of Lusts,<br />
					is set free from the Deadly Taint of Becomings,<br />
					is set free from the Deadly Taint of Ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, thus set free,<br />
					there arises the knowledge of his emancipation,<br />
					and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth has been destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher life has been fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">What had to be done has been accomplished.</p>

					<p class="f4">After this present life<br />
					there will be no beyond!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Sirs,<br />
					as if in a mountain fastness<br />
					there were a pool of water,<br />
					clear, translucent, and serene;<br />
					and a man, standing on the bank,<br />
					and with eyes to see,<br />
					should perceive the oysters and the shells,<br />
					the gravel and the pebbles<br />
					and the shoals of fish<br />
					as they move about or lie within it:<br />
					he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This pool is clear, transparent, and serene,<br />
					and there within it<br />
					are the oysters and the shells,<br />
					and the sand and gravel,<br />
					and the shoals of fish are moving about<br />
					or lying still.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Sirs, when a Bhikshu knows thus and sees thus,<br />
					would that make him ready to take up the subject:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the soul the same thing as the body,<br />
					or is the soul one thing and the body another?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Sir, it would not."</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, Sirs, know thus and see thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And nevertheless I do not say either the one or the other."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And pleased at heart,<br />
					the two recluses,<br />
					Maṇḍissa the wandering mendicant,<br />
					and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattika<br />
					exalted the word of the Blessed One.</p>
