					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta</b></h4>

					<p>This Dialogue comes very appropriately immediately after the <a href="dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm">Brahman.</a> That dealt with the general question of pride of birth, or social position. This deals with the special question of what is the essential quality which makes a man a Brahman. The conclusion is, no doubt, substantially the same. But there is a difference, and the difference is instructive.</p>

					<p>In trying to gain over Brahman to his (the Buddha's) view of the essential distinction — rather than birth or social position — between man and man, Gotama includes the whole list as set out above in the thirteen divisions of the <a href="dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm">Sāmaññaphala</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>. In trying to gain over Soṇadaṇḍa to his (the Buddha's) view of what is the essential quality that makes a man a Brahman, he gives the same details, but puts the <i>Jhānas</i> (the states of Ecstasy) not under Conduct, but under <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panna.htm"><i>Paññā</i></a> (intelligence).</p>

					<p>The reason seems to be simply that the verse, on which the exposition in the Brahman turns, mentions only Wisdom and Conduct (containing no word for Intelligence), and that it is not thought accurate to put the states of Ecstasy (which are Indian, not specially Buddhist) under Wisdom. It is true that the Buddhist position is that 'goodness is a function of intelligence, as beauty is of health' (to quote the words of Matthew Bassendine). But under Intelligence they always distinguish two phases — the enquiring, and necessarily therefore doubting, activity, of the mind; and the final stage of emancipation and peace when the laws of the universe are clearly seen, and firmly grasped, and cheerfully acquiesced in.</p>

					<p><a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> It is this latter phase which they call Wisdom <i>(Vijjā</i>)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> - the contrary of the <i>Avijjā,</i> which is ignorance of the action of <i>Karma,</i> of the Four Noble Truths, and of the doctrine of the <i>āsavas</i> or Intoxications. The man who knows these; who, finally and permanently out of the jungle and in the open, quite beyond the stage of 'wasting his wonder on the fabulous soul,' has attained to, and remains in this state of Nirvāṇa in Arahatship, is not only, in Buddhist terminology, called a Brahman, but is, in fact, declared to be the only true Brahman.</p>

					<p>It is amazing that Soṇadaṇḍa, as learned as he is wealthy, does not see that this, the logical outcome of the Buddha's argument, and carefully led upto in the final paragraph of the exposition,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> is really incompatible with the supremacy of the Brahmans in the ordinary sense of that word. He is baffled by the skill with which he is gradually led on, by the usual Socratic method adopted in so many of the Dialogues, to accept one self-evident truth after another. There is indeed nothing, till we come to that last paragraph, which any intelligent Brahman could not, with safety, and with due regard to his own doctrine, fully accept. In other words, the doctrine of Brahman supremacy was intellectually indefensible. It was really quite inconsistent with the ethical standard of the times, which the Brahmans, in common with the rest of the people, fully accepted.</p>

					<p>Our Sutta is by no means the only one in which the same, or a similar, argument leads up to the same, or a similar, conclusion. It will aid us in understanding the real gist of our Sutta to mention one or two of these.</p>

					<p>In the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p58">Tikaṇṇa</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p59">Jāṇussoṇi</a> Suttas of the Aṇguttara<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the question put by the Buddha is: 'What sort of person do you Brahmans acknowledge to be a <i>Ṭevijja</i> Brahman (a Brahman with threefold lore)?'</p>

					<p>The answer of each of the Brahmans is, in the words of our Sutta, § 4: 'A Brahman well born on both sides, of pure descent, through the father and through the mother, back through seven generations, with no slur put upon him, and no reproach, in respect of birth — a repeater (of the sacred words) knowing the mystic verses by heart, one who has mastered the Three Vedas, with the indices, the ritual, the phonology, and the exegesis (as a fourth), and with the <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> legends as a fifth — a man learned in the (etymologies of the) words and in the grammar, versed in <i>Lokāyata</i> (Nature-lore)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> and in the theory of the signs on the body of a great man.'</p>

					<p>Whereupon the Buddha rejoins that in the teaching of the Arahats the 'threefold lore' is different; and on being asked what it is, answers in the words of sections 93, 95, and 97 of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">Sāmañña-phala Sutta,</a> which are quoted as the last three paragraphs of his exposition in our Sutta, that is to say,</p>

					<p class="in1">a. The knowledge of one's own previous births.<br />
					b. The knowledge of other people's previous births.<br />
					c. The knowledge of the Four Truths, and of the Four Intoxications <i>(āsavas),</i> leading on to the emancipation of Arahatship.</p>

					<p>The only difference is that at the end of each section, and after the words setting forth the emancipation, the following sentence is added:</p>

					<p><i>'This first (or second, or third) lore hath he required. Ignorance is dispelled within him, and wisdom has been born. The darkness has been dissipated, the light has appeared. (And all this) inasmuch as he has continued in earnestness, in zeal, in mastery of himself.'</i></p>

					<p><i>And at the end of the whole the following verses are also added:</i></p>

					      <p class="in2">'Him do they honour whose heart, — unswerving in goodness, and wise,<br />
							Given to earnest thought, — rests in his own control,<br />
							Pacified, stedfast. And him resolute, able in method,<br />
							Threefold in knowledge, dispelling the darkness, the conqueror of Death, who<br />
							Lived for the weal of gods and of men delivered from folly,<br />
							Him of the threefold lore, mindful and self-possessed,<br />
							Him do they honour, the Buddha, our Gotama, wearing now,<br />
							Conqueror, too, of Birth, the last of his mortal frames!'</p>

					      <p class="in2">'Tis he who is a Brāhmaṇa indeed<br />
							Who knows the births that he has lived before;<br />
							And sees (with Heavenly Eye) the states of bliss,<br />
							And states of woe, that other men pass through;<br />
							Has reached the end of all rebirths, become<br />
							A sage, perfect in insight, Arahat,<br />
							In these three modes of knowledge threefold wise.<br />
							<a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> Him do I call a Brahman, threefold wise,<br />
							And not the man who mutters o'er again<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystic verse so often muttered through before.'</p>

					<p>How important a place this doctrine occupied in early Buddhism is made evident by the fact that this latter stanza, with variations at the close, is so constantly repeated. We find it in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p99">99th Sutta of the <i>Itivuttaka</i> (p. 100)</a> and in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p91">91st Sutta of the <i>Majjhima</i> (the Brahmāya Sutta).</a> And it is quoted also, not only in this Sutta in the <i>Aṇguttara,</i> and in another Sutta in the <i>Saṃyutta</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.07.001-022.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.7.9">(I, 167),</a> but also in the collection of verses from the <i>Piṭakas</i> called the <i>Dhammapada</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v423">(verse 423);</a> and also in the other collection of such verses (probably belonging to some other school of Buddhists), now preserved in the oldest MS. yet discovered in India, the so-called Kharoshṭhi MS., portions of which have simultaneously found their way, last year, to both St. Petersburg and Paris.</p>

					<p>The whole section of the <i>Dhammapada,</i> which contains this quotation, consists of no less than forty verses, each of which, from one point of view or another, emphasise this point of the identification, by the Buddhists, of the Arahat with the Brahman. Twenty-seven of them are taken from the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp35">Vāseṭṭha Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta</a> in which the question raised is precisely the same as that raised in our Sutta, and in which the reply, though different in details, amounts to much the same as the reply given here.</p>

					<p>Two conclusions force themselves upon us. It is, in the first place, a striking proof of the high social esteem in which the Brahmans, as such, and quite irrespective of character, were held by the masses of the people. We have hitherto only had the views which the Brahmans held about themselves. And very absurd they seem to readers whose own vivid sense of superiority rests on a self-complacency quite as inexpugnable as that of the Brahmans. Here we have evidence from an independent source, — evidence all the stronger because it is found in Suttas in which the exclusive claims of the Brahmans by birth are vigorously contested. When the Buddhists, in selecting a title of honour for those they valued so highly, for the best of men, for the Arahats, selected the name of Brahman, it is clear that that word, in the opinion of the early Buddhists, conveyed to the minds of the people an exalted meaning, a connotation of real veneration and respect. And it is not likely that this would have been the case unless the Brahmans had, at least as <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> a general rule, deserved it — and on other grounds than the mere prerogative of birth.</p>

					<p>In the second place, if the contention of the Buddhists had been universally accepted — if the word Brahman had come to mean, not only a man of a certain descent, but exclusively a man of a certain character and insight then the present caste system of India could never have grown up. But it was obviously impossible that the contention should succeed.</p>

					<p>The method, adopted by all reformers, of pouring new wine into old bottles, putting new meanings into ancient words, can only succeed under conditions, that, in this case, were non-existent. And it is always open to the danger that, with the old and hallowed word, the old superstition associated with it will also survive. It was a method largely adopted by the Buddhists; and in numerous other cases, to which I have elsewhere called attention, adopted with success. The subsequent language of India is full of phrases and words which bear, not the meaning which they previously bore, but the new and higher meaning put into them by Buddhists. But in this case the two ideas were too widely apart, too contradictory. A physical meaning cannot be replaced by an ethical one. The actual facts of life, which they could not alter, could not, indeed, attempt to alter, were a constant influence, against their view, too strong to be overcome. Brahmans by birth, many of them, perhaps most of them, engaged in various worldly trades and occupations, and therefore Brahmans only by birth, were so constant and so important a factor in the daily and hourly life of the people, that the idea of birth could not be dissociated from the word. The Buddhists failed. And they not only failed, their very choice of the word as a title of honour, must (through the wide influence they exercised for so many centuries throughout and beyond the valley of the Ganges) have actually afforded a fresh strength to the veneration which the word inspired. The very means they adopted to lend weight to their doctrine of emancipation became a weapon to be turned against themselves.</p>

					<p>It is unlikely that this really mattered much. The point was only one detail in a broad scheme which was doomed from the outset to failure-that is if failure to attain immediate and lasting acceptance can rightly be called the failure of a theory of life.</p>

					<p>A theory which placed the ideal in Self-conquest, regarded final salvation as obtainable in this world, and in this world <a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> only, and only by self-conquest — a view of life that ignored the 'soul' and brought the very gods themselves under the domain of law — a religious movement which aimed its keenest shafts against all those forms of belief in the supernatural and mysterious, appealing most strongly alike to the hopes and to the fears of the people — a philosophy that confined itself to going back, step by step, from effect to cause, and poured scorn on speculations as to the ultimate origin and end of all things — might gain, by the powerful personality of its founder and the enthusiasm and zeal of his early followers, a certain measure of temporary success. But it fought against too many vested interests at once, it raised up too many enemies, it tried in 'pouring new wine into the old bottles' to retain too much of the ancient phraseology, for lasting victory — at least at that time, and in an advancing country then assimilating to itself surrounding peoples at a lower grade of culture. The end was inevitable. And it was actually brought about, not by persecution, but by the gradual weakening of the theory itself, the gradual creeping back, under new forms and new names, of the more popular beliefs.</p>

					<p>The very event, which seemed, in the eyes of the world, to be the most striking proof of the success of the new movement, the conversion and strenuous support of Asoka, the most powerful ruler India had had — indeed the first real overlord over practically the whole of India — only hastened the decline. The adhesion of large numbers of nominal converts, more especially from the newly incorporated and less advanced provinces, produced weakness, rather than strength, in the movement for reform. The day of compromise had come. Every relaxation of the old thoroughgoing position was widely supported by converts only half converted. And the margin of difference between the Buddhists and their opponents gradually faded almost entirely away. The soul theory, step by step, gained again the upper hand. The caste system was gradually built up into a completely organised system. The social supremacy of the Brahmans by birth became accepted as an incontrovertible fact. And the inflood of popular superstition which overwhelmed the Buddhist movement, overwhelmed also the whole pantheon of the Vedic gods. Buddhism and Brahmanism alike passed practically away, and modern Hinduism arose on the ruins of both.</p>

					<p>The struggle is now being renewed under conditions perhaps, on the whole, more favourable. The tone of worldliness and love of material comfort, the eager restless- <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> ness of modern social, and economic competition, the degradation of learning to a mere means of getting on and making money, are no doubt all unfavourable to any movement for the social and religious elevation of a people. But history shows, notably in the case of the Reformation in Europe, how powerfully the contact of two diverse views of life tends to widen the thoughts of men. Both India and Europe in the twentieth century may be fairly expected to afford fresh examples of the same influence. And in India the powerful aid of the new methods of science and of historical criticism will lend their invaluable aid to the party endeavouring, now once again, to place the ideal, not in birth, but in character and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One once, when going on a tour through the Aṇga country<br />
					with a great multitude of the brethren,<br />
					with about five hundred brethren,<br />
					arrived at Campā.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there at Campā<br />
					he lodged on the bank of the Gaggarā Lake.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Brahman Soṇadaṇḍa<br />
					was dwelling at Campā,<br />
					a place teeming with life,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with much grassland and woodland<br />
					and water and corn,<br />
					on a royal domain<br />
					granted him by Seniya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadhā,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					as a royal fief,<br />
					with power over it<br />
					as if he were the king.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[2]</span> Now the Brahmans and householders of Campā<br />
					heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They say that the Samaṇa Gotama of the Sākya clan,<br />
					who went out from a Sākya family<br />
					to adopt the religious life,<br />
					has now arrived,<br />
					with a great <a id="pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> company of the brethren<br />
					at Campā,<br />
					and is staying there<br />
					on the shore of the Gaggarā Lake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now regarding that venerable Gotama,<br />
					such is the high reputation<br />
					that has been noised abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">— 'That Blessed One is an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness,<br />
					happy,<br />
					with knowledge of the worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One,<br />
					a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself,<br />
					thoroughly knows and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face<br />
					this universe —<br />
					including the worlds above of the gods,<br />
					the Brahmas,<br />
					and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below<br />
					with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples,<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth,<br />
					lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />
					doth he proclaim,<br />
					both in the spirit and in the letter,<br />
					the higher life doth he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness,<br />
					and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And good is it<br />
					to pay visits to Arahats like that.'"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt112" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg112"><span class="f2">[112]</span></a> And the Brahmans and householders of Campā<br />
					began to leave Campā in companies<br />
					and in bands<br />
					from each district,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					so that they could be counted,<br />
					to go to the Gaggarā Lake.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[3]</span> Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman had gone apart<br />
					to the upper terrace of his house<br />
					for his siesta,<br />
					and seeing the people thus go by,<br />
					he said to his doorkeeper:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why are the people of Campā, going forth like this<br />
					towards the Gaggarā Lake?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the doorkeeper told him the news.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, good doorkeeper,<br />
					go to the Brahmans and householders of Campā,<br />
					and say to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman<br />
					desires them to wait.</p>

					<p class="f4">He will himself come to see the Samaṇa Gotama.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Sir,"<br />
					said the doorkeeper,<br />
					and he did so.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt113" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg113"><span class="f2">[113]</span></a> [4] Now at that time<br />
					there were about five hundred Brahmans<br />
					from different kingdoms<br />
					lodging at Campā<br />
					for some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they heard<br />
					that Soṇadaṇḍa was intending to visit <a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> the Samaṇa Gotama,<br />
					they went to Soṇadaṇḍa,<br />
					and asked whether that was so.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is my intention, Sirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">I propose to call on the Samaṇa Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let not the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa do that.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not fitting for him to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it were the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa<br />
					who went to call upon him,<br />
					then the venerable Soṇadaṇḍa's reputation<br />
					would decrease<br />
					and the Samaṇa Gotama's would increase.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first reason<br />
					why you, Sir,<br />
					should not call upon him,<br />
					but he upon you."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[5]</span> And they laid before Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman<br />
					in like manner<br />
					also other considerations,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was well born on both sides,<br />
					of pure descent<br />
					through the mother and through the father<br />
					back through seven generations,<br />
					with no slur put upon him,<br />
					and no reproach in respect of birth -</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was prosperous,<br />
					well to do,<br />
					and rich —</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt114" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg114"><span class="f2">[114]</span></a> That he was a repeater<br />
					(of the sacred words),<br />
					knowing the mystic verses by heart,<br />
					one who had mastered the Three Vedas,<br />
					with the indices,<br />
					the ritual,<br />
					the phonology,<br />
					and the exegesis<br />
					(as a fourth),<br />
					and the legends as a fifth,<br />

					(Nature-lore),<br />
					and in the theory of the signs<br />

					<p class="f4">That he was handsome,<br />

					stately<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> to behold —</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was virtuous,<br />
					increased in virtue,<br />

					<p class="f4">That he had a pleasant voice<br />
					and pleasing delivery,<br />
					and was gifted with polite address,<br />
					distinct,<br />
					not husky,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					suitable for making clear<br />
					the matter in hand —</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was the teacher<br />
					of the teachers of many,<br />
					<a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> instructing three hundred Brahmans<br />
					in the repetition of the mystic verses,<br />
					and that many young Brahmans,<br />
					from various directions<br />
					and various counties,<br />
					all craving for the verses,<br />
					came to learn them by heart under him —</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was aged,<br />
					old, and well stricken in years,<br />
					long-lived and full of days —</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was honoured,<br />
					held of weight,<br />
					esteemed worthy,<br />
					venerated and revered by Seniya Bimbisāra,<br />
					the king of Magadhā —</p>

					<p class="f4">That he was honoured,<br />
					held of weight,<br />
					esteemed worthy,<br />
					venerated and revered<br />
					by Pokkharasādi, the Brahman —</p>

					<p class="f4">That he dwelt at Campā,<br />
					a place teeming with life,<br />
					with much grassland and woodland and corn,<br />
					on a royal fief<br />
					granted him by Seniya Bimbisāra,<br />
					the king of Magadhā,<br />
					as a royal gift,<br />
					with power over it<br />
					as if he were the king —</p>

					<p class="f4">For each of these reasons<br />
					it was not fitting that he, Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman,<br />
					should call upon the Samaṇa Gotama,<br />
					but rather that the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
					should call upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt117" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg117"><span class="f2">[117]</span></a> Truly, Sirs, the Samaṇa Gotama<br />

					<p class="f4">But all Samaṇas and Brahmans<br />

					<p class="f4">And guests we ought to esteem and honour,<br />

					<p class="f4">And as he is now so come,<br />
					he ought to be so treated,<br />

					<p class="f4">For each and all of these considerations<br />
					it is not fitting<br />

					<p class="f4">And so far only<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[7]</span> And when he had thus spoken,<br />
					those Brahmans said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The venerable Soṇadaṇḍa<br />

					<p class="f4">Let us then all go<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg151"><span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></a> So Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman<br />
					went out to the Gaggarā Lake<br />
					with a great company of Brahmans.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[8]</span> Now the following hesitation<br />
					arose in Soṇadaṇḍa's mind<br />
					as he passed through the wood:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were I to ask the Samaṇa Gotama a question,<br />
					if he were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The question ought not to be asked so,<br />
					thus ought the question to be framed';</p>

					<p class="f4">the company might thereupon<br />
					speak of me with disrespect,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Foolish is this Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman,<br />
					and inexpert.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt118" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg118"><span class="f2">[118]</span></a> He is not even able to ask a question rightly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But if they did so<br />
					my reputation would decrease;<br />
					and with my reputation<br />
					my incomings would grow less,<br />
					for what we have to enjoy,<br />
					that depends on our reputation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
					were to put a question to me,<br />
					I might not be able to gain his approval<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by my explanation of the problem.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if they were then to say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The question ought not to be answered so;<br />
					thus ought the problem to be explained;</p>

					<p class="f4">the company might thereupon<br />
					speak of me with disrespect,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Foolish is this Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman,<br />
					and inexpert.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not even able to satisfy the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
					by his explanation of the problem put.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But if they did so,<br />
					my reputation would decrease;<br />
					and with my reputation<br />
					my incomings would grow less,<br />
					for what we have to enjoy,<br />
					that depends upon our reputation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But on the other hand<br />
					if, having come so far,<br />
					I should turn back<br />
					without calling upon the Samaṇa Gotama,<br />
					then might the company speak disrespectfully of me,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Foolish is this Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman,<br />
					and inexpert,<br />
					though obstinate with pride,<br />
					he is so afraid<br />
					that he dare not call on the Samaṇa Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can he turn back<br />
					after having come so far?'</p>

					<p class="f4">But if they did so,<br />
					my reputation would decrease;<br />
					and with my reputation<br />
					my incomings would grow less<br />
					for what we have to enjoy,<br />
					that depends upon our reputation."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[9]</span> So Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman<br />
					went up to where <a id="pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> the Blessed One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come there<br />
					he exchanged with the Blessed One<br />
					the greetings and compliments<br />
					of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as to the Brahmans and householders of Campā,<br />
					some of them bowed to the Blessed One<br />
					and took their seats on one side;<br />
					some of them exchanged with him<br />
					the greetings and compliments<br />
					of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and then took their seats on one side;<br />
					some of them called out their name and family,<br />
					and then took their seats on one side;<br />
					and some of them took their seats on one side in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt119" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg119"><span class="f2">[119]</span></a> [10] Now as Soṇadaṇḍa was seated there<br />
					he was still filled with hesitation,<br />
					thinking as before set out;<br />
					and he added to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh! would that the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
					would but ask me some question<br />
					on my own subject,<br />
					on the threefold Vedic lore.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, I should then be able to gain his approval<br />
					by my exposition of the problem put!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[11]</span> Now the Blessed One became aware in his own mind<br />
					of the hesitation in the mind of Soṇadaṇḍa,<br />
					and he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This Soṇadaṇḍa is afflicted in his heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">I had better question him<br />
					on his own doctrine."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the things, Brahman,<br />
					which the Brahmans say a man ought to have<br />
					in order to be a Brahman,<br />
					so that if he says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a Brahman,'<br />
					he speaks accurately<br />
					and does not become guilty of falsehood?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[12]</span> Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt120" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg120"><span class="f2">[120]</span></a> "What I wished and desired<br />

					some question on my own subject,<br />
					on the threefold Vedic lore —<br />
					that he now does.</p>

					<p class="f4">Oh! that I may be able to satisfy his heart<br />
					with my exposition thereof!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[13]</span> And drawing his body up erect,<br />
					and looking round on the assembly,<br />
					he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Brahmans, Gotama, declare him to be a Brahman<br />
					who can accurately say<br />
					'I am a Brahman'<br />
					without being guilty of falsehood,<br />
					who has five things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are the five?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first place, Sir,<br />

					of pure descent<br />
					back through seven generations,<br />
					with no slur put upon him,<br />
					and no reproach,<br />
					in respect of birth —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is a repeater<br />

					<p class="f4">Then he is handsome,<br />

					fine in presence,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then he is virtuous,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Gotama, that could be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">We could leave out the verses.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[18]</span> Then the Blessed One said to those Brahmans:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If you, oh Brahmans,<br />

					<p class="f4">But if you think him learned,<br />

					able to hold his own,<br />
					then do you keep silence,<br />
					and let him discuss with me."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[19]</span> And when he had thus spoken,<br />
					Soṇadaṇḍa the Brahman said to those Brahmans:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let not the venerable ones say so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Sirs.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt123" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.04.pali.bd.htm#pg123"><span class="f2">[123]</span></a> I do not depreciate<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[20]</span> Now at that time a young Brahman named Angaka,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span><br />

					was seated in that company.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Soṇadaṇḍa said to those <a id="pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> Brahmans:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Sir, we see him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well! Angaka, Sirs, is handsome,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, oh Brahman, there appears in the world<br />
					one who has won the truth, an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy,<br />
					who knows all worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One, a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face this universe,<br />
					— including the worlds above of the gods,<br />
					the Brahmas, and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples, —<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />
					doth he proclaim,<br />
					both in the spirit and in the letter,<br />
					the higher life doth he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or one of his children,<br />
					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the Tathāgata<br />
					(the one who has found the truth);<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has thus become a recluse<br />
					he lives self-restrained<br />
					by that restraint<br />
					that should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight,<br />
					and he sees danger<br />
					in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure are his means of livelihood,<br />

					<p class="f4">Mindful and self-possessed<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, oh Brahman, is his conduct good?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this, oh Brahman, that the Bhikshu,<br />

					<p class="f4">The cudgel and the sword he has laid aside,<br />
					and ashamed of roughness,<br />
					and full of mercy,<br />
					he dwells compassionate and kind<br />
					to all creatures that have life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, oh Brahman, is that uprightness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the taking of what has not been given,<br />

					he passes his life in honesty<br />
					and purity of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, oh Brahman, is that uprightness.</p>

					what he hears elsewhere<br />
					he repeats not here<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus does he live as a binder together<br />

					a peacemaker,<br />
					a lover of peace,<br />
					impassioned for peace,<br />

					pleasant to the car,<br />
					lovely,<br />

					<p class="f4">Putting away frivolous talk,<br />

					on religion,<br />
					on the discipline of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks,<br />
					and at the right time,<br />
					words worthy to be laid up in one's heart,<br />
					fitly illustrated,<br />
					clearly divided,<br />
					to the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikshu holds himself aloof<br />

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					not eating at night,<br />
					refraining from food after hours<br />
					(after midday).</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from being a spectator<br />
					at shows at fairs,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just so, oh Brahman, the Bhikshu,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, oh Brahman,<br />

					<p class="f4">He grasps the fact:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body of mine has form,<br />

					<p class="f4">He enjoys the Wondrous Gift in its various modes<br />
					— being one he becomes many,<br />
					or having become many becomes one again;<br />
					he becomes visible or invisible;<br />
					he goes, feeling no obstruction,<br />
					to the further side of a wall or rampart or hill,<br />
					as if through air;<br />

					as if through water;<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, oh Brahman,<br />

					<p class="f4">And at early dawn<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Akkhuddāvakāso,</i> for which Buddhaghosa (pp. 282, 284) gives three contradictory explanations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> 'Eighty thousand families on the mother's, and eighty thousand on the father's side,' says Buddhaghosa — making a total for the Sākya clan of 800,000, reckoning five to a family.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Kamma-vādī kiriya-vādī</i>. Compare <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>'Vinaya Texts,'</i></a> II, 109,112.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>ādīna-khattiya-kulā.</i> The reading is doubtful, and the Burmese MSS., after their constant habit, have replaced it by an easy reading, <i>abhinna-khattiya-kulā,</i> 'unbroken Kshatriya family.' But all the Sinhalese MSS. agree in reading either <i>ādina</i> or <i>ādīna;</i> and if the reading had once been <i>abhinna,</i> it is difficult to see how the alteration to the more difficult reading should have occurred. Buddhaghosa skips the clause, which (if it was in the text before him) is suggestive. He would scarcely have done so unless the matter were really very simple. 'Autonomous' would make a good sense in the context; but I have taken the word, in the sense of 'primordial, aboriginal,' as being a derivative from <i>ādi,</i> in the same way as <i>adhīna</i> is from <i>adhi.</i> This is simple enough; the only difficulty being, that the word occurs nowhere else.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Literally 'anyhow'; 'such as by wearing no clothes' explains Buddhaghosa (p. 288).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Puṭaṃsenāpi.</i> Compare <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.190.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> II, 183,</a> where a precisely similar phrase occurs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Cittaṃ na ārādheyyaṃ,</i> 'win over his mind.' Comp. <i>M.</i> I, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.013.pali.bd.htm#pg85">85,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg341">341;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg10">II, 10;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm"><i>Mil.</i></a> 25.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> That is, 'officiate at a sacrifice by pouring out of a spoon a libation of butter, or of spirituous <i>Soma,</i> to the fire god.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Vaṇṇa,</i> much the same as 'caste,' though that rendering is not strictly accurate. (See the Introduction to the Brahman.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> The full text is repeated, both here and in the following sections.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> This name looks suspiciously like a kind of personification of the five <i>Aṇgas</i> (the five characteristics) of the true Brahman as just above, &sect;13, set out.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Oldenberg renders this (<i>'Buddha,'</i> P. 283) as follows: 'The wisdom of the upright and the uprightness of the wise have, of all uprightness and wisdom in the world, the highest value.' I cannot see how this can be grammatically justified; though the sentiment is admirable enough, and would have somewhat relieved the monotony of the paragraph. On <i>paññāna</i> as nominative, not genitive, see, for instance, <i>S.</i> I, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.071-081.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.1.72">41,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.071-081.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.1.73">42;</a> <i>Sum.</i> 1, 171, 290; <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.086.pali.bd.htm#pg342"><i>A.</i> IV, 342.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The repetition here is nearly the same as that in the <i>Brahman Sutta,</i> summarised above at the translation of p. 100 of the text. The only difference is that the paragraphs 64-74 of the <i>Sāmañña-phala</i> there included as coming under <i>Caraṇa</i> (Conduct) are here included under <i>Sīla</i> (Uprightness). The <i>Jhānas,</i> there put, not under <i>Vijjā,</i> (Wisdom), but under <i>Caraṇa,</i> are here put, not under <i>Sīla,</i> but under <i>Paññā</i> (Intelligence). In other words <i>Paññā</i> includes all that was there included under <i>Vijjā,</i> and the Four <i>Jhānas</i> besides. But <i>Sīla</i> includes all that is put in the Brahman under <i>Sīla</i> — all indeed of the eight divisions of <i>Sīla</i> as summarised above, pp. 57-59. See Buddhaghosa's notes at pp. 219, 268, 292.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> On the ground, says Buddhaghosa (p. 292), that he would be saluting a much younger man, one young enough to be his grandson. If this tradition be correct, it would follow that this Sutta must be describing events very early in the public ministry of the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> It will be seen from this section that Soṇadaṇḍa is represented as being a convert only to a limited extent. He still keeps on his school of Vedic studies, and is keenly anxious to retain the good opinion of his students, and of other Brahmans. And if that part of the Buddha's doctrine put before him in this Sutta be examined, it will be found to be, with perhaps one or two exceptions, quite compatible with the best Brahman views. No doubt if every detail were carried to its strict logical conclusion there would be no further need for Vedic studies, except from the historical standpoint. But those details are, on the face of them ethical. They belong to a plane not touched on in the then Vedic studies. They could be accepted by an adherent of the soul theory of life. And the essential doctrines of Buddhism — the Path, the Truths, and Arahatship — are barely even referred to.</p>
