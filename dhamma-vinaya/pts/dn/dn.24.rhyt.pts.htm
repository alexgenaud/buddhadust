					to the<br />
					Pāṭika Suttanta</b></h4>

					<p>This Suttanta is concerned really with only two topics, firstly that of mystic wonders, and secondly that of the origin of things. The former has been dealt with much better and more fully in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p11">Kevaddha;</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the latter, here treated quite curtly and by way of appendix only, is fully discussed below in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p27">Aggamia.</a></p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200">
							<p><i>Argumentum ad homiuem.</i> 1. Directed at or appealing to one's hearer's or reader's personal feelings or prejudices rather than his intellect and reason; 2. marked by attack on an opponent's character rather than by answer to his contentions.</p>

						</div>

					<p>The treatment here is clumsy. It is no doubt intended to be both humorous and edifying. But the humour is far removed from the delicate irony of the Kevaddha and the Aggamia. The fun is of the pantomime variety; loud, and rather stupid. It is funny perhaps to hear how a corpse gets slapped on the back, wakes up just long enough to let the cat out of the bag, and then falls back dead again; or how an incompetent medicine-man gets stuck fast to his seat, and wriggles about in his vain endeavours to rise. But this sort of fun would appeal more strongly to a music-hall audience, or to schoolboys out for a holiday, than to those who are likely to read it in this volume. And the supposed edification is of the same order. As an <i>argumentum ad homiuem,</i> as propounded for the enlightenment of the very foolish Sunakkhatta (and this is just, after all, what it purports to be), it may pass muster. Whether it can have appealed to (or was even meant to appeal to) wiser folk is very questionable. One gets rather bored with the unwearied patience with which the Tathāgata is here represented as suffering fools gladly. And it is difficult to bear with an author who tells stories so foolish merely to prove that the Tathāgata is as good a magician as the best, and who has the bad taste to put them into the mouth of the Tathāgata himself. Not only in style and taste does this Suttanta differ from the others. In doctrine also it is opposed to them. The wonders in which the peoples of India, in the sixth century B.C., believed were not very different from those so easily, at the same period, <a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> believed in Europe. The mental attitude regarding them was, I venture to think, not at all the same. In the West, though the other view was also found, the prevailing belief was that such wonders were the result of the interference of some deity suspending, or changing, the general law, the sequence of things that generally happened. In India, though this view was sometimes held by some, the prevailing belief was that such wonders (whether worked by humans, gods, or animals) were in accordance with law. In a word, they were not miracles. There is a tendency to make little of this distinction, but it is really of vital importance. It is the difference between Animism and what I have ventured to call Normalism, the exact contrary of Animism.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>The early Buddhists did not deny the occurrence of such marvels; on the contrary, they accepted them in the Normalistic sense held by most of their more cultured compatriots. But they held them in low esteem. The Kevaddha makes the Master say:</p>

					<p>"It is because I see danger in the practice of such mystic wonders that I loathe, and abhor, and am ashamed thereof."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And he is there represented as maintaining that the real wonder, the one he advocates, is the wonder of education — a thesis then set out in detail, and set out, in all probability, for the first time in the history of the world.</p>

					<p>So at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.29.rhyt.pts.htm"><i>Dīgha</i> III, 112, 113</a> (translated below), a distinction is made between such wonders as are ignoble and those that are noble <i>(Ariyan).</i> The former are all the wonders worked by the unconverted, or the worldly. The latter is the wonder of self-mastery.</p>

					<p>Then again there is a special rule in the canon law:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>This is a misunderstanding of the way the rules were applied. It is nowhere stated that the rules apply to The Buddha himself. This is not hypocrisy, but the special role of a Buddha. Where for example the display of magic power by anyone other than the Buddha could subject the individual to both scorn and danger and subject him to the charge that he was and more importantly could be disbelieved by the people and become a source of distrust in the order and doctrine, when performed by the Buddha it becomes a challenge to the mind to accept it. The rationalization is that in his case alone being the path-finder, a skeptic can trust (that is, allow for the possibility that he knew more than one's self) the action to have been properly motivated. There are two other related considerations: The acclaim an individual might gain from performing feats of magic could result in that individual becoming seduced by fame, and that fame might detract others from attention to the deeper message of the Dhamma. These two dangers do not exist in the case of the Buddha performing feats of magic power.</p>

						</div>

					<p>You are not, O Bhikkhus, to display before the laity the wonders of Iddhi, surpassing the power of ordinary men. Whosoever does so shall be guilty of a wrong act <i>(dukkaṭa)</i>.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Yet in this Suttanta we have the Master, who is said in the <i>Vinaya</i> to have laid down this rule, represented as doing the very thing he denounces in the Rule as a wrong act. We have before us then a case, not only of divergence in doctrine, but of complete contradiction. What does it mean? It is partly a question of time, partly a question of individual eccentricity, and partly a question of toleration. Our Suttanta can scarcely have grown up in the community <a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> after the period in which the Rule just quoted became acknowledged in the community as valid. Now the occurrence in the Rule of the technical term <i>dukkata</i> (wrong act), a term not found in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm#patimokkha"><i>Patimokkha,</i></a> shows (for the reasons given by Oldenberg in the Introduction to his edition of the text) that the Rule in question belongs to the third and latest stage in the evolution of the Canon Law. We must allow, at least, two or three generations after the death of the Buddha for this evolution. During that interval different individuals in the community held different views as to the powers of magic. No one believed in miracles in the European sense of that word. But there were a number of individuals who thought it edifying to ascribe the power of magic, and to ascribe it in ever increasing degree, to the Buddha and his most famous disciples. The view of the more intelligent; the view that ultimately, in great measure, prevailed; and so far as we can judge, the view of the Buddha himself, was the view put forward in the Kevaddha and allied passages. But the other view was also held by weaker vessels. And when the anthology called the <i>Dīgha</i> was put together, its editor, or editors, included not only both old and new, but also stories, legends or paragraphs embodying views divergent and even opposed. We are not entitled on these facts to suppose that the <i>Pāṭika Suttanta</i> was either later or earlier than the Kevaddha. Both may have been already current in the community when the <i>Dīgha</i> was edited, and the editors may have been tolerant of whichever of the opposing views they did not share; or they may have thought the story should go in, as it clearly implied how very silly Sunakkhatta was, and how deplorably weak were the views he held.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The word 'Arahant' is, in this Suttanta, applied by Sunakkhatta to three persons — religieux of the baser sort, devoid, in all that we are told about them, of the essential qualities of the Arahant as laid down in the Nikāyas. He is simply not using the word in the Buddhist sense at all. The expression is pre-Buddhistic. It is used, for instance, in the Brāhmaṇa of the Hundred Paths of kings and priests, not apparently with any ethical connotation, but simply as people entitled to receive gifts and respect, and who are apt to be very angry if these be not forthcoming.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> It is here an honorific title, used of worldly people of distinguished position. It might be freely rendered Right Honourable, but <a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a> really means worthy or entitled to receive gifts. In our Suttanta it is applied by Sunakkhatta, who rejects the new movement of reform, to ascetics as such merely on account of their self-mortification <i>(tapas)</i>.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> It might be rendered His Worship (that is, worth-ship) or His Reverence. In this he has the devas on his side. They are represented as saying of one become emaciated by voluntary starvation that he is like in appearance to an Arahant.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> Now the dear devas were not considered as very bright, except in their outward form. They were intellectually on a level with the chorus in a Greek play, or with the man in the street of the modern journalist, but they talk, no doubt, the language of men, and we may take it that at the time of the rise of Buddhism the word Arahant had come to be popularly applied, not only to priests and kings, but also to ascetics.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>As in so many other cases, the leaders of the new movement adopted the current term, but poured, as it were, new wine into the old bottle by using it with a new connotation. They tried the same plan also with the old term Brahmin, and then they failed; vested interests were too strong for them.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>In this particular case they succeeded. Seldom or never in later writings do we find the word in its old sense. It has the reformed meaning only — viz., that of a man who has reached the end of the Ariyan Path and has the consequent knowledge and sense of emancipation.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> And as a consequence of this we find alongside of the old derivation (from <i>arahati,</i> to be worthy of) all sorts of fanciful and purely exegetical explanations. So at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.039.pali.bd.htm#pg280"><i>Majjhima</i> I, 280</a> the word is connected with <i>āraka,</i> distant, because all evil dispositions are far from the Arahant, and the <i>Visuddhi Magga</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> and the <i>Abhidhāna Padīpikā Sūcī</i> <i>(s.v.)</i> give a number of others of the same kind.</p>

					<p>Arahant, in the new sense, thus differs from the ancient usage in connoting not worldly position or the outward signs of asceticism, but a radical change of heart, and an alertness of intellect so ingrained that it amounts, at times, to intuition. There are many passages in the oldest texts <a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> giving the details of this ideal state.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> The post-canonical history of the word is a striking testimony to the decline of the faith. The later writers, whether in Pali or Sanskrit, do not know any contemporary Arahants. For them Arahants, whether laymen or not, existed only in the good old times. We have seen above<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> how the Buddha, just before his death, in the talk with his last convert, gives utterance to the hope: May the brethren live the perfect life, that the world be not bereft of Arahants!</p>

					<p>According to the view of Buddhist writers, the world has been bereft of Arahants for more than two thousand years. But the Buddhist Messiah is to come and then there will be Arahants again.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>There arises out of this a further question: Who, in the oldest period, could be an Arahant? The answer is: Anyone — men or women, old or young, lay or <i>religieux.</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> There is a statement in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm"><i>Milinda</i></a> (p. 264) that Whoever has attained, as a layman, to Arahantship, one of two courses is possible to him, and no other — either that very day he enters the Order, or he dies, for beyond that day he cannot last.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p class="f2"><b>Adumbration:</b> A vague description.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p>No confirmation of this has so far been found in the <i>Nikāyas</i>. But there is an adumbration to such a doctrine in the <i>Kathā Vatthu</i> (IV. i) when the objector has decidedly the best of the argument against the Thera-vādin. The latter depends on a statement put into the Master's mouth in the <i>Majjhima:</i></p>

					<p>'There is no layman who, without putting away the bonds that bind laymen, obtains after death the end of ills.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>But this is a very different matter and is no answer, as pointed out by the objector, to the fact that examples are given of laymen who become Arahants. When laymen had experienced the mental change called becoming an Arahant, the natural result, under the conditions prevailing in North India in the sixth or fifth centuries B.C., would be that he <a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> would become a religieux. And this may have been sufficient reason for such opinions as those expressed in the <i>Kathā Vatthu</i> and the <i>Milinda</i> having, in the course of centuries, grown up.</p>

					<p>We talk now of the Buddha, and have scarcely begun to be familiar with the term Arahant. In the old days these were so closely allied that they really gave expression to two facets of the same jewel. Every Buddha (awakened one) was an Arahant. Every Arahant was buddha (awakened).<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#mallas">Mallas,</a><br />
					at Anupiya, one of their towns.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, having robed himself in the early morning,<br />
					put on his cloak and took his bowl,<br />
					and entered the town for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is too early for me now<br />
					to go through Anupiya for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">I might go to the pleasaunce<br />

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One went to the pleasaunce<br />
					and to the place where Bhaggava the Wanderer was.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhaggava spake thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let my Lord the Exalted One come near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome to the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is long since the Exalted One<br />

					to come our way.</p>

					<p class="f4">May it please you, Sir,<br />

					here is a seat made ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One sat down thereon,<br />

					sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So <a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> seated,<br />
					Bhaggava the Wanderer spake thus<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">I am remaining no longer<br />

					<p class="f4">Is the fact really so,<br />
					just as he said?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is just so, Bhaggava,<br />

					<p class="f4">Some days ago, Bhaggava,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">In such wise have you been wont,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta,<br />
							spoken the praises of the Dhamma<br />
							among the Vajjians:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Well proclaimed by the Exalted One<br />

									to be understood by every wise man for himself."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">In such wise have you been wont,<br />
							among the Vajjians,<br />
							to utter praise of the Dhamma.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">In many ways have you, Sunakkhatta,<br />
							spoken the praises of the Order<br />
							among the Vajjians:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Well are they trained,<br />
									the Order of the Exalted One's disciples,<br />
									even the four branches thereof.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">The eight classes of individuals<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span><br />
									well trained in uprightness,<br />
									in principles<br />
									and in courtesy.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">This Order should be respected<br />

									gifts should be given it,<br />
									and homage;<br />
									for it is the world's unsurpassed field<br />
									(for sowing) merit."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">In such wise have you been wont,<br />
							among the Vajjians,<br />
							to utter praise of the Order.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">I tell you Sunakkhatta,<br />
							I make known to you Sunakkhatta,<br />
							that there will be those that shall say concerning you<br />
							thus:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis<br />
									was not able to live the holy life<br />
									under Gotama the recluse.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">And he, not being able to adhere to it,<br />
									hath renounced the discipline<br />
									and turned to lower things."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Bhaggava, did Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis,<br />
					addressed by me,<br />
					depart from this Doctrine and Discipline,<br />
					as one doomed to disaster and purgatory.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time, Bhaggava,<br />
					I was staying among the Bumu's.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uttarakā is a village of theirs,<br />
					and having dressed early one morning,<br />
					I afterwards took my bowl,<br />
					put on my robe,<br />
					and went into Uttarakā for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, at that time, a cynic there,<br />
					Bandylegs the Khattiya,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was wont to behave like a dog,<br />
					walking on all fours,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span><br />
					<a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> or sprawling on the ground<br />
					and taking up food,<br />
					whether hard or soft,<br />
					with his mouth only<br />
					(without using his hands).</p>

					<p class="f4">Sunakkhatta, seeing him act thus, thought:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'How truly admirable does he look,<br />
							the holy man,<br />
							the recluse creeping on all fours,<br />
							or sprawling on the ground,<br />
							taking up food,<br />
							whether hard or soft,<br />
							with his mouth only.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Bhaggava,<br />
					knowing what was in his mind,<br />
					said to him:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Do you, O foolish man,<br />
							confess yourself<br />
							as following the son of the Sakiyas?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'What does the Exalted One mean, Sir,<br />
							in saying this to me?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Did you not think, Sunakkhatta,<br />
							as you looked at that naked Cynic, Kora the Khattiya,<br />
							on all fours,<br />
							sprawling on the earth,<br />
							taking up his food,<br />
							whether hard or soft,<br />
							with his mouth only:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"How admirable were it to be a holy man like that"?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Yes, lord, I did.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">What then!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Does the Exalted One begrudge Arahantship in others?'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Nay, foolish man.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">I begrudge in no one Arahantship.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">It is only in you<br />
							that this vicious opinion has arisen.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Put it away.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Let it not become a lasting source<br />
							of harm and ill to you.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">This naked cynic, Kora the Khattiya,<br />
							whom you, Sunakkhatta, fancy so admirable an arahant,<br />
							will die seven days hence<br />
							of an epilepsy,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span><br />
							and dying he will be reborn<br />
							as one of the Kālakañjas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span><br />
							the very lowest of the Asura groups.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">As dead,<br />
							he will be laid out<br />
							on a heap of birana grass<br />
							in the charnel field.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">You might go up to him,<br />
							if you wish,<br />
							and ask him:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Do you know your own destiny, friend Kora?"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Perchance he will reply:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"I know my own <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> destiny, friend Sunakkhatta.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">There are Asuras called Kalakanjas, the very lowest of the Asura groups — 'tis among them I am reborn."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereat, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis,<br />
					went up to the cynic, Kora the Khattiya,<br />
					and spake thus to him:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Friend Kora the Khattiya,<br />
							the Samaṇa Gotama has declared that on the seventh day hence,<br />
							the naked ascetic, Kora the Khattiya, will die,<br />
							and dying<br />
							he will be reborn as one of the Kalakanjas,<br />
							the very lowest of the Asura groups.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">As dead,<br />
							he will be laid on a heap of birana grass<br />
							in the charnel field.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Wherefore, friend Kora the Khattiya,<br />
							you should partake of food with great moderation;<br />
							you should drink liquids with great moderation;<br />
							so that the word of the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
							may prove wrong.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sunakkhatta, so firmly did he disbelieve the Tathāgata,<br />
					counted up the seven days one after another;<br />
					but, Bhaggava, on the seventh day,<br />
					Kora the Khattiya died of an epilepsy,<br />
					and dying<br />
					was reborn as one of the Kalakanjas,<br />
					the very lowest of the Asura groups;<br />
					and as dead,<br />
					was laid out on a heap of birana grass<br />
					in the charnel field.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Sunakkhatta heard, Bhaggava,<br />
					that Kora the Khattiya lay dead in the charnel field<br />
					on a heap of birana grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went thither<br />
					where the corpse was lying,<br />
					and thrice he smote the naked ascetic<br />
					with his hand, saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Do you know, friend Kora the Khattiya,<br />
							what has been your destiny?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhaggava, Kora the Khattiya,<br />
					rubbing his back with his hand,<br />
					raised himself up and said:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'I know, friend Sunakkhatta,<br />
							what is my destiny.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Among the Kalakanjas,<br />
							the very lowest of the Asura groups —<br />
							there am I reborn.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying, he fell back supine.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me,<br />
					and saluting me,<br />
					sat down beside me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So <a id="pg14"><span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></a> sitting,<br />
					I spake to him thus:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'What think you, Sunakkhatta?</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Has it happened to the cynic, Kora the Khattiya,<br />
							even as I declared to you,<br />
							or otherwise?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'It has happened to him<br />
							even as the Exalted One declared to me,<br />
							not otherwise.'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'What think you, Sunakkhatta?</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">This being so,<br />
							has a mystic wonder<br />
							by power beyond that of ordinary men<br />
							been wrought,<br />
							or has it not?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Surely, sir, this being so,<br />
							such a mystic wonder has been wrought.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'And is it then to me, you foolish man,<br />
							who have thus<br />
							by power beyond that of ordinary men,<br />
							wrought a mystic wonder,<br />
							that you say:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Sir, the Exalted one works me no miracles<br />
									with his superhuman gifts?"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">See, foolish man,<br />
							how far you have committed yourself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Bhaggava, did Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis,<br />
					addressed by me,<br />
					depart from this Doctrine and Discipline,<br />
					as one doomed to disaster and to purgatory.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesalī<br />
					in the Great Wood,<br />
					at the Gable Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					there was a naked ascetic residing at Vesalī, named Kandara-masuka,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and great was his gain<br />
					and his fame<br />
					in the Vajjian home.</p>

					<p class="f4">He had vowed<br />
					and taken upon himself<br />
					seven rules of life,<br />
					to wit:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'So long as I live<br />
							I will be of the Naked Ascetics,<br />
							I will put on no garment;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">so long as I live,<br />
							I will be a devotee,<br />
							devoted to a life of chastity;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">so long as I live,<br />
							I will maintain myself<br />
							by spirituous drink and by flesh,<br />
							eating no rice-broth or gruel;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">I will never go beyond the Udena shrine<br />
							on the east of Vesall;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">the Gotamaka shrine<br />
							on the south;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">the Sattamba shrine<br />
							on the west,</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">and the Bahuputta shrine<br />
							on the north.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It was because of his having laid <a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> upon himself<br />
					these seven rules of life<br />
					that he had gain and fame<br />
					beyond all others<br />
					in the Vajjian home.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta of the Licchavis<br />
					went to call on Kandara-masuka<br />
					and asked him a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kandara-masuka did not follow the question,<br />
					and not following,<br />
					manifested resentment,<br />
					dislike,<br />
					and anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to Sunakkhatta:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'We might come into conflict<br />
							with<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span> the admirable arahant recluse.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Let nothing happen<br />
							that would make for lasting harm and ill to us.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi<br />
					came to call upon me,<br />
					and saluting me,<br />
					he sat down beside me<br />
					and thus I spake to him:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Do you, O foolish man,<br />
							still confess yourself<br />
							as following the son of the Sakiyas?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'What does the Exalted One mean<br />
							in saying that?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Why, Sunakkhatta, did you not go up to the naked ascetic, Kandara-masuka<br />
							and ask him a question which he did not follow,<br />
							and over which he manifested anger,<br />
							dislike,<br />
							and resentment?</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And did it not occur to you:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"We might come into conflict<br />
									with the admirable arahant and recluse."</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">Let nothing happen<br />
									that would make for lasting harm and ill to us?"'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'It was even so, Sir.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Does the Exalted One begrudge arahantship in anyone?'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Nay, foolish man,<br />
							I begrudge in no one Arahantship.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">To you only<br />
							has this vicious opinion arisen.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Get rid of it.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Let that not make<br />
							for lasting harm and ill to you.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">This naked ascetic Kandara-masuka,<br />
							whom you think so admirable an arahant recluse,<br />
							will ere long end his days clothed and married,<br />
							his diet rice-broth and rice-gruel;<br />
							his range past all shrines in Vesalī,<br />
							and he will die fallen from his fame.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And ere long, Bhaggava,<br />
					that ascetic ended his days clothed and married,<br />
					his diet rice-broth and rice-gruel;<br />
					his range past all shrines in Vesalī,<br />
					and died fallen from his fame.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg16"><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></a> Now Sunakkhatta heard that Kandara-masuka, the ascetic,<br />

					and died fallen from his fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he came to call upon me,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, Bhaggava, did Sunakkhatta the Licchavi,<br />

					<p class="f4">He held forth thus<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">If the Samaṇa Gotama would come half-way,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Thus, to whatever extent he may perform,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi<br />

									if he withdraw not those words,<br />
									if he put not away that idea,<br />
									if he renounce not that opinion.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">If he thinks that, holding to those words, to that idea, maintaining that opinion, he would come to meet the Samaṇa Gotama, his head would split asunder."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Thus, Sunakkhatta, have I both discerned in my mind:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Incompetent is the naked ascetic, Pāṭika's son,<br />
									to meet me face to face,<br />
									if he withdraw not those words,<br />
									if he put not away that idea,<br />
									if he renounce not that opinion.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">If he thinks that,<br />
									holding to those words,<br />
									to that idea,<br />
									maintaining that opinion,<br />
									he would come to meet the Samaṇa Gotama,<br />
									his head would split asunder,"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">and a deva has also announced to me:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Incompetent is the naked ascetic, Pāṭika's son,<br />
									to meet me face to face,<br />
									if he withdraw not those words,<br />
									if he put not away that idea,<br />
									if he renounce not that opinion.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">If he thinks that,<br />
									holding to those words,<br />
									to that idea,<br />
									maintaining that opinion,<br />
									he would come to meet the Samaṇa Gotama,<br />
									his head would split asunder."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now Sunakkhatta, when I have gone to Vesalī<br />
							on my round for alms,<br />
							and have dined,<br />
							and am on the way back,<br />
							I will go to Pāṭika's son's Park.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Tell him, then, Sunakkhatta, whatever you think right.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I, Bhaggava, having dressed early,<br />
					and taken my bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Vesalī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And after my meal,<br />
					as I returned,<br />
					I went into Pāṭika's son's park for siesta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta the Licchavi,<br />
					in a great hurry,<br />
					went into Vesalī,<br />
					and went to all the most distinguished of the Licchavis<br />
					and told them saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Friends, that Exalted One,<br />
							on returning from his round for alms,<br />
							and after dining,<br />
							has gone to Pāṭika's son's park for siesta.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Come forth, sirs, come forth.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">There is going to be wonder-working<br />
							by the superhuman gifts<br />
							of admirable recluses.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those most distinguished among the Licchavis thought:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'There is going to be wonder-working<br />
							by the superhuman gifts<br />
							of admirable recluses.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Come then, let's go.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And wherever there were eminent brahmins<br />
					and wealthy householders of position,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who had become Wanderers<br />
					or brahmins of different sects,<br />
					there he went and told them saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Friends, that Exalted One,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Come forth, sirs, come forth.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">There is going to be wonder-working<br />

					<p class="f4">And those most eminent brahmins<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">'There is going to be wonder-working<br />
							by the superhuman gifts<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Come then, let's go.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Bhaggava, those eminent Licchavis<br />
					and distinguished brahmins<br />
					and wealthy householders of position,<br />
					now Wanderers or brahmins of different sects,<br />
					all repaired to the park of the naked ascetic, Pāṭika's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg19"><span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></a> they formed an assembly of several hundred,<br />
					nay, of several thousand persons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Pāṭika's son heard that all these people were come out<br />
					and that the Samaṇa Gotama himself<br />
					was sitting,<br />
					during siesta,<br />
					in his park,<br />
					and hearing of it,<br />
					fear came upon him<br />
					and trembling<br />
					and creeping of the flesh.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus afeared,<br />
					agitated,<br />
					and in dread,<br />
					he went away to the Tinduka Pollards,<br />
					the Wanderers' Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that company, Bhaggava,<br />
					heard that he had gone thither in a panic,<br />
					and they charged a certain man, saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Come, my man,<br />
							go to the Tinduka Pollards<br />

									<p class="f4 in4">And the Samaṇa Gotama himself is sitting,<br />

									<p class="f4 in4">You, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />

											<p class="f4 in6">If the Samaṇa Gotama would come half-way,<br />

											<p class="f4 in6">If the Samaṇa Gotama work one such mystic wonder,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Very good', said that man,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Come forth then half-way, friend Pāṭika's son;<br />

					<p class="f4">When this was told him, Bhaggava,<br />
					the naked ascetic, Pāṭika's son, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am coming, friend, I am coming,'<br />
					writhed about then and there<br />
					and was unable to rise from his seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the man to him:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'How now, friend Pāṭika's son?</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Are your hams stuck to your seat,<br />
							or is your seat stuck to your hams?</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">You <a id="pg20"><span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></a> say:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"I am coming, friend, I am coming", yet you writhe about<br />
							and are not able to rise from your seat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And though this was said to him, Pāṭika's son repeated:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am coming, friend, I am coming,'<br />
					but only writhed about,<br />
					unable to rise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the man recognized Pāṭika's son's discomfiture,<br />
					hearing his words<br />
					and seeing his incapacity,<br />
					he went to the assembly<br />
					and told them, saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'The naked ascetic Pāṭika's son seems discomfited.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">He says:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"I am coming, friend, I am coming,"<br />
							but he only writhes about as he sits<br />
							and is unable to get up.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, Bhaggava,<br />
					I said to the assembly:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Incompetent, friends, is the naked ascetic, Pāṭika's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Bhaggava, a certain councillor of the Licchavis<br />

					<p class="f4">Then that councillor went to the Tinduka Pollards,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this was told him, Bhaggava,<br />

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus said, Bhaggava,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Bhaggava, Jaliya,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now when Jaliya, Wooden-Bowl's pupil,<br />
					recognized the ascetic's discomfiture,<br />
					he spake to him thus:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Long ago, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />
							this idea occurred to the lion,<br />
							king of the beasts:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span></p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"What if I were to make my lair near a certain jungle,<br />
									so that in the evening I could issue from my lair,<br />
									and stretch myself and survey the landscape,<br />
									and thrice roar a lion's roar,<br />
									and go forth towards the cattle pastures.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">I could slay the pick of the herd of beasts,<br />
									feast on a continual diet of tender flesh,<br />
									and get me back to that same lair."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Then the lion, friend, made his lair near a certain jungle,<br />
							so that in the evening he could issue from his lair,<br />
							and stretch himself and survey the landscape,<br />
							and thrice roar a lion's roar,<br />
							and go forth towards the cattle pastures.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And he would slay the pick of the herd of beasts,<br />
							feast on a continual diet of tender flesh,<br />
							and get him back to that same lair.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />
							there was an old jackal<br />
							who had continually thriven<br />
							on the remains of that lion's food,<br />
							and was stout and strong,<br />
							and it occurred <a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> to him:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span></p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Who am I,<br />
									and who is Lion,<br />
									king of the beasts?</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">What if I were to choose my lair near a certain jungle,<br />
									so that in the evening I could issue from my lair,<br />
									and stretch myself and survey the landscape,<br />
									and thrice roar a lion's roar,<br />
									and go forth towards the cattle pastures?</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">I could slay the pick of the herd of beasts,<br />
									feast on a continual diet of tender flesh,<br />
									and get me back to that same lair."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now, friend, that old jackal chose his lair<br />
							near a certain jungle,<br />
							and coming forth in the evening and stretching himself,<br />
							and surveying the landscape, he thought:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Thrice will I roar a lion's roar",<br />
							and thereat he roared a jackal's howl,<br />
							a vulpine howl.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Would you compare a vile jackal's howl<br />
							with a lion's roar?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Even so, you, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />

							feeding on food left over after the Wellfarer has been served,<br />
							fancy you can reach up to those<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Why, what have wretched Pāṭika's sons in common<br />
							with Tathāgatas, Arahants, Buddhas Supreme?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now since Jaliya, Bhaggava, was unable,<br />
					even by this parable,<br />
					to make the ascetic leave his seat,<br />
					he went on:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>'The jackal on himself reflecting deemed:<br />

							The scurvy jackal and the lion's roar?</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Even so do you, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Why, what have wretched Pāṭika's sons in common<br />
							with Tathāgatas, Arahants, Buddhas Supreme?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Bhaggava, since Jaliya was unable,<br />
					even by this parable,<br />
					to make the ascetic leave his seat,<br />
					he said this to him:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>'Roaming the pleasant woods, seeing himself<br />

							But lo! he roars — a puny jackal's howl.<br />
							For what is there in common 'twixt the twain:<br />
							The scurvy jackal and the lion's roar?</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Even so do you, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Why, what have wretched Pāṭika's sons in common<br />
							with the Tathāgatas, Arahants, Buddhas Supreme?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Bhaggava, since Jaliya was unable,<br />
					even by this parable,<br />
					to make the ascetic leave his seat,<br />
					he went on thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>'Feeding on frogs, on barn floor mice, and on<br />
							The corpses laid apart in charnel-field,<br />
							In the great forest, in the lonely wood<br />
							The jackal throve and fancied vain conceits:<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Even so you, friend Pāṭika's son,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">What have wretched Pāṭika's sons in common<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, Bhaggava, since Jaliya was unable,<br />
					even by this parable,<br />
					to make the ascetic leave his seat,<br />
					he went back to the meeting and told them, saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">If it occurred to my noble friends, the Licchavis:<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Bhaggava, I taught,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">'Verily, Sir, it being even so,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Behold, O foolish man,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, Bhaggava, did Sunakkhatta the Licchavi,<br />

					<p class="f4">They, so asked by me,<br />

					<p class="f4">To whom I, being asked,<br />

							when, sooner or later,<br />
							after the lapse of a long epoch,<br />
							the world is dissolved and evolved.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When this takes place,<br />
							beings have mostly been reborn in the World of Radiance.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">There they dwell,<br />
							made of mind,<br />
							feeding on rapture,<br />
							radiating light from themselves,<br />
							traversing space,<br />
							continuing in beauty,<br />
							and thus they remain —<br />
							for a long, long period of time.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now there comes also a time, friends,<br />
							when, sooner or later,<br />
							this world-system begins to re-evolve.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When this happens,<br />
							the abode of the Brahmfis appears,<br />
							but it is empty.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And some being or other,<br />
							either because his span of years has passed,<br />
							or because his merit is exhausted,<br />
							deceases from that world of Radiance,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn62" href="#n62">62</a>]</sup></span><br />
							and comes to life in the abode of the Brahmins.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And there also he lives,<br />
							made of mind,<br />
							feeding on rapture,<br />
							radiating light from himself,<br />
							traversing space,<br />
							continuing in beauty;<br />
							and thus does he remain<br />
							for a long, long period of time.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now there arises in him,<br />
							from his dwelling there so long alone,<br />
							a dissatisfaction and a longing:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"Oh, would that other beings too<br />
									might come to join me in this place!"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And just then,<br />
							either because their span of years had passed,<br />
							or because their merit was exhausted,<br />
							other beings fall from the world of Radiance<br />
							and appear in the abode of the Brahmas<br />
							as companions to him;<br />
							and in all respects,<br />
							they lead a life like his.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">On this, friends,<br />
							that being who was first reborn<br />
							thinks thus:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"I am Brahmā,<br />
									the great Brahmā,<br />

									<p class="f4 in4">A while ago I thought:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">Would that other beings too<br />
									might come to this state of being!</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">Such was the aspiration of my mind,<br />
									and lo!<br />
									these beings did come."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And those beings themselves<br />
							who arose after him,<br />
							they too think thus:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">"This worthy must be Brahmā,<br />
									the great Brahmā,<br />
									the Vanquisher,<br />
									the Unvanquished,<br />
									the All-Seeing,<br />
									the Disposer,<br />

									the Maker,<br />
									the Creator,<br />
									the Chief,<br />
									the Assigner,<br />
									Master of myself,<br />

									and are to be.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">By this Brahmā have we,<br />
									good sirs, been created.</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">And why is that so?</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">Because he, as we see,<br />
									arose here first,<br />
									but we arose after him."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">On this, friends,<br />
							that being who first arose<br />
							becomes longer lived,<br />
							handsomer,<br />
							and more powerful,<br />
							but those who appeared after him become shorter lived,<br />
							less comely,<br />
							less powerful.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And it might well be, friends,<br />
							that some other being,<br />
							on deceasing from that state,<br />
							should come to this state [on earth].</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">So come,<br />
							he might go forth<br />
							from the household life<br />
							into the homeless state.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">And having thus gone forth,<br />
							by reason of ardour,<br />
							effort,<br />
							devotion,<br />
							earnestness,<br />
							perfected intellection,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn64" href="#n64">64</a>]</sup></span><br />
							he reaches up to such rapt concentration,<br />
							that with rapt mind<br />
							he calls to mind his former dwelling-place,<br />
							but remembers not what went before.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">He says thus:</p>

									<p class="f4 in4">'That worshipful Brahmā, that great Brahmā,<br />
									the Vanquisher,<br />
									the Unvanquished,<br />
									the All-Seeing,<br />
									the Disposer,<br />

See Compendium of Philosophy (<i>Pali Text Soc,</i> 1910), pp. 136, 142, 167. The exceptional nature of these beings, figuring in the <i>Rūpaloka,</i> where, at least, sight, hearing, and mind were ascribed to the variously staged denizens, affords a fertile field for the quasilogical exercises of the Yamaka catechisms — <i>e.g.</i> the Khandha, Āyatana, Yamakas, etc. — <i>q.v.</i> (<i>P.T.S.,</i> 1911); below, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.33.09.rhyt.pts.htm#n3">244, <i>n.</i> 1.</a></p>
