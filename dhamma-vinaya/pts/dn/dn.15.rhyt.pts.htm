					<p>T<span class="f2">HE</span> doctrine of <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda</i> — that all <i>dhammā</i> (phenomena physical and mental) are <i>paṭicca-samuppannā</i> (happen by way of cause) finds in the following Suttanta the fullest exposition accorded to it throughout the Piṭakas. It is true that for some reason (<i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm#fn60">p. 26, <i>n.</i>1</a>) the <i>Dīghabhāṇakas</i> (recorders of the <i>Dīgha-Nikāya</i>) excluded the first two of the Twelve Nidānas — <i>avijjā, sankhārā</i> — and that, in the <i>Paccayākāra-vibhanga</i> of the <i>Abhidhamma,</i> the formula is reiterated and analysed with greater variety of presentation. But in the present instance the doctrinal contents are more fully worked out. There is another feature in this <i>Dīgha</i> exposition which seems to us of no little significance.</p>

					<p>But before discussing this feature, we would point to yet another factor in the statement of the chain of the <i>Nidānas</i> which does not find a place in the <i>Nidāna-Suttanta.</i> This is the schematized, or abstract formula of the whole sequence, showing the logic of it without the contents —|| ||</p>

					      <p class="in2">'That being thus, this comes to be,<br />
							from the coming to be of that, this arises.<br />
							That being absent, this does not happen,<br />
							from the cessation of that, this ceases.'<br />
							<span class="f2"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.14.pali.bd.htm#pg32">(<i>M.</i> II, 32.)</a></span></p>

					<p>In the other <i>Nikāyas</i> the scheme usually precedes the full formula, and in one case where the principle of the latter is called 'the <i>Dhamma,</i>' <i>supersedes</i> the formula. It is on all fours with the modern formulation of the law of causation — 'That every event is the result or sequel of some previous event, or events, without which it could not have happened, and which, being present, it must take place.'</p>

					<p>The significant feature is this: — although the formula, as expounded in this Suttanta, ends in the usual way — 'Such is the uprising of this whole body of Ill' — the burden of the Dialogue is in no way directly concerned with Ill, pain or sorrow. In certain other passages, on the other hand, where the Nidāna-chain occurs, <i>dukkha</i> occupies the foreground. Thus in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.061.pali.bd.htm#pg177"><i>A.</i> I, 177,</a> the formula of the Paṭicca-samuppāda is rehearsed to explain the Aryan Truth of the uprising of Ill.</p>

					<p><a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> In <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.028.pali.bd.htm#pg190"><i>M.</i> I, 190</a> the context of the formula is an exhortation by <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> on the primary importance of a right attitude towards, and understanding of, the nature and causes of Ill, so that the brethren may meet persecutions — ills not due to their own ill deeds — with fortitude and serenity. In the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm"><i>Nidāna Saṃyutta</i></a> of the <i>Saṃyutta-Nikāya,</i> all the contexts of the formula known to the compilers are grouped together. Of the ninety-three brief Suttas of which this division consists, only one-sixth of those in which the formula occurs, have <i>Dukkha</i> (or its opposite) for their subject. A <i>slightly</i> larger <i>proportion</i> of the Suttas (16) are so many statements upholding the truth of the evolution of phenomena by way of natural causation. That any being exists absolutely and eternally is at the same time denied. And that any being ever perishes absolutely is equally denied. Of the remaining Suttas, four, in which <i>Loka,</i> the world of sense-perception, is substituted in the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda</i> for <i>Dukkha,</i> belong virtually to the foregoing sixteen. Seven are concerned with rebirth, eight are ethical exhortations to destroy Craving, and <i>thirty-six</i> emphasize the importance of mastering the <i>principle</i> of the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda.</i> That holds the key to insight; to understand it is therefore the test of true knowledge and sound doctrine. This too is the point in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_55_sotapattisamyutta.htm#p28"><i>Saṃyutta</i> V, 387-9,</a> where the formula again occurs. Once more, in the very strongly emphasized rehearsal of the formula in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p38"><i>'Great Taṇha-sankhaya-Sutta'</i></a> of <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.038.pali.bd.htm"><i>M.</i> I, 256,</a> the doctrine there inculcated is not in any way hedonistic, sentimental or, directly, moral. It has nothing to say about <i>Dukkha.</i> It is a repudiation of the belief in any permanent, transmigrating intelligent principle (<i>viññāṇa</i>) in man, and the affirmation of the contrary view-that <i>viññāṇa</i> is a contingent phenomenon, a happening by way of cause and effect, something that 'becomes' and dies away.</p>

					<p><i>Dukkha,</i> on the other hand, and the causes of it — <i>'evam ... samudayo'</i> — holds, in nearly every case, the last word in this notable formula. And according to the Buddhist records, as told in the preceding Suttanta, the fact and sequence of those causes dawn ever on the mind of every Buddha in response to the anguished questionings of his mind brooding over the misery of the world, and of the infinite living and dying in it.</p>

					<p>Hence in trying to account adequately for the profound significance and high importance attached by the founders of Buddhism to the doctrine of the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda,</i> we need to keep in view this dual aspect of it — that it is a way of explaining phenomena, and that the most interesting phenomenon <a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> to be explained is that of <i>Dukkha.</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> The latter standpoint is that of man as recipient or percipient, the former, that of man as intellective or interpreting.</p>

					<p>Now if to this twofold aspect we add that of man as reacting, by will and deed, to his impressions and his interpretations, and take the Buddha's doctrine of the Eightfold Path, as the corresponding formula, we have not only the whole of Early Buddhism in a nutshell, but also just those points concerning which we find the most emphatic affirmations of <i>Dhamma</i> as <i>Dhamma</i> ascribed to Gotama — </p>

					      <p class="in2">'Both in the past and now do I set forth <i>just this:</i> —<br />
							"<i>dukkha</i> and the cessation of <i>dukkha</i>."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="in2">'Let us put aside questions of the Beginning and the End.<br />
							I will teach you the Dhamma: —</p>

							<p class="in2">That being thus, this comes to be.<br />
							From the coming to be of that, this arises.<br />
							That being absent, this does not happen.<br />
							From the cessation of that, this ceases.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="in2">'There is a Middle Path ...<br />
							discovered by the Tathāgata<br />
							(discovered by none but a Tathāgata, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_45_maggasamyutta.htm#p14"><i>S.</i> V. 14</a>)<br />
							... this <i>Aryan Eightfold Path</i> ... .'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							This Path, my friend, <i>is</i> the religious life (<i>brahmacariya</i>).'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>These three central tenets are put, by our earliest and best authorities, in these or other words, into the mouth of Gotama himself at the very outset of his career, in his first sermon, as the doctrine of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_saccani.htm">the Four Aryan or Noble Truths.</a> And the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda,</i> with its positive formula of uprising (<i>Samudaya</i>), and its negative formula of passing away (<i>Nirodha</i>), covers the ground staked out by the second and third of these Truths. It is frequently quoted in this connexion,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and its importance in the <i>Dhamma</i> is thereby made the more evident.</p>

					<p>But the reason for that importance only becomes clear, when we look away from the <i>dukkha</i> to which the formula is <a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> so often applied, away too from the antecedents of <i>dukkha,</i> and consider all that is implied in the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda</i> by way of method and <i>Weltanschauung.</i></p>

					<p>If we persist in viewing either <i>Dukkha</i> or its causes as the 'secret' of the doctrine, we might omit the formula altogether, since the nature and cause and effect of each <i>nidāna</i> is fully taught in each <i>Nikāya.</i> Nor is the order of sequence the main tenet. Frequent liberties are taken in the Canon with both order and number of <i>nidānas.</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> Nor finally could the arrangement of antecedents and consequences in an iterated rigmarole (convenient for oral transmission) appeal with the runic force of a Shibboleth to a movement of thought like that of Buddhism, any more than would the similarly arranged fragment of formula contained in the <i>Sānkhya Kārikā</i> have appealed, as such, to the followers of that school. No reformers who so carefully purged their literature of all the <i>'eulalic'</i> reiterations of <i>Om! Hari!</i> and the rest, that so throng the pages of the <i>Upanishads,</i> would care a brass farthing for any 'accumulative jingle' accounting for things after the fashion of the widely spread pre-historic folk-rune, 'The cat began to kill the rat, the rat began to gnaw the rope,' etc. ... '<i>and so</i> the old woman got home that night.' <i>Evam etassa, etc.</i></p>

					<p>It was not the fact of <i>Dukkha,</i> nor the fairly obvious conditions of birth and so on, leading up to it, that come as a revelation to each Buddha, beneath his Bo-tree. It was the process of <i>samudaya</i> and <i>nirodha</i> as a natural and universal law. 'Coming to pass! Coming to pass! At that thought there arose in me a Vision into things not called before to mind, and knowledge arose, insight, wisdom, light arose.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> Not uncaused and casually, nor by the fiat of Icvara — Indra, Soma, Varuna, Brahmā<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> — did events happen, painful or otherwise; not as Job and the Psalmist taught — 'God distributeth sorrows in his anger.'  For 'God is a righteous judge, and God is angry every day.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Events came impelled by preceding conditions, causes that man could by intelligence and good will, study and govern, suspend or intensify.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> Thus Buddhaghosa, in explaining the name <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda,</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> points out that it <i>excludes</i> all theories of absolutism, nihilism, chance, irregular causation,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> and indeterminism.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> And of such theories, it is concerning the implied rejection of the first two that he is most explicit. Namely, that there is no persistent ego reaping results in one life sown as causes in a previous life, and that it is not a different, an alien ego either, which reaps. The latter person (<i>attabhāva</i>) is the resultant, the creature, the 'evolute' of the former. Thus faithfully was the tradition of the <i>Piṭakas</i> preserved, wherein the view of <i>viññāṇa</i> a as a persistent ego was categorically contradicted in the words <i>aneka-pariyāyena paṭicca-samuppanna</i> (causally evolved in various ways). <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p38"><i>M.</i> I, 256.</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Let it be remembered that the 'immanent' absolutism opposed by Buddhism was chiefly the Brahmanic theosophy. According to this, the <i>âtman</i> of the individual was not so much an efflux of the World-Âtman, as was the latter immanent in, and identified with, each man-soul. 'In the beginning this world was only Soul, in the shape of a man ... world-guardian, world-lord, this that is My Soul.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> 'My Soul' was therefore, in that theosophy, the personal First <a id="pg47"><span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span></a> Cause, and Final Cause. And hence the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda</i> of Buddhism was as decided a negation of all teleology as was the theorem of Demokritus and his master Leukippus 'that nothing happens by chance, but everything through a cause and of necessity.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Had the fates been kinder to the writings of the Atomist of Abdera, had the 'teleological reaction' not been led by two men of such extraordinary genius as Plato and Aristotle, it is conceivable that the whole philosophy, not to say the <i>Dhamma,</i> of the West, might have flowed along a channel in which the influence of the <i>mikros</i> and the <i>megas Diakosmos</i> might have brought both that philosophy and that <i>Dhamma</i> more nearly parallel to the informing principle of the <i>Paṭicca-samuppāda.</i> As it happened, Europe learned from Athens compromise and comprehensiveness, learned to believe in a universe governed partly by necessity and partly by chance, learned to combine belief in unchanging natural law with belief in first and final causes.</p>

					<p>And so gradually has the realm of regular, causal sequence encroached upon that of the casual and the arbitrary, that on no period in the intellectual development of Europe can we place our finger and say: — Here the concept of a universe governed, as to its every movement and happening, by natural causation, was brought home to the minds of men, — to the mind of one man. There is nothing resembling the intellectual earthquake caused half a century ago by that extension of the law of causation: the theory of evolution. Or was there some such milestone of rational development reached, when Demokritus formulated the philosophy of Atomism, and won renown as a great prophet and teacher of mankind?</p>

					<p>In the history of Indian thought, on the other hand, we can point to such an epoch-making crisis, we can discern the significance of the law of universal causation breaking in on a great mind with a flash of intuition. The law, we read, stands as fundamental, whether Tathāgatas have arisen or not. But the Tathāgata penetrates and masters it, and delivers the knowledge thereof to the world.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> No such crisis of thought is patent in the literature of the Brahmins, though that literature extends over practically the whole era of Indian culture. Those <i>Upanishads</i> which are ranked as the oldest show a naïf animism: those ranked later reveal thought attained to relative maturity.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> But there is no evidence of a transition causing a mental upheaval. In the seventy-two stanzas of the <i>Sânkhya Kârikâ,</i> again, 25 per cent contain some consciously generalized affirmation respecting cause and effect. The abstract causal concept shows as a well-matured instrument of metaphysical thought. Throughout the <i>Yoga Sûtra</i> too we find allusions to causality as an abstract idea.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> It is only in the Buddhist <i>Nikāyas</i> that we come up against the actual effort itself of the human mind to get at a more scientific view of world-order, — an effort which is marked with the freshness and vigour of a new fetch of intellectual expansion, and the importance and gravity of which is affirmed with the utmost emphasis, both in the earliest records and in the orthodox literature of ten centuries later.</p>

					<p>The significance of the <i>Piṭakas,</i> as the vehicle of this evolutionary cry of travail and new birth, is not minimized by the objection, that a gospel promulgated by laymen (<i>Khattiyas</i>), and preached to the man in the street, would naturally regard, as truths new and wonderful, axioms which, to the more esoteric, philosophical schools of the day, were the commonplaces of dialectical metaphysic. For we have shown that, in the one case where such a school has preserved its ancient literature, we find books of pre-causational and post-causational thought, but nothing indicating that the conviction of a law of universal natural causation was taking birth. The aphorisms, constituting the oldest existing survivals of Yoga and Sânkhya thought, reveal no inner evolution of philosophic progress, and no traces of early animistic culture such as appear in certain of the <i>Upanishads.</i> Most of the Jain literature still awaits it editor, but we have Dr. Jacobi's learned authority for it, that, in spite of an atomistic theory of some interest, its philosophy was crude, animistic and mere 'common <a id="pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> sense.' It is not likely therefore that the Angas which are still unedited will reveal any conception of causation possessing deep philosophical insight. Hence all early Indian literature, for which any such insight is claimed, except that of Buddhism, either shows both the child-like and the more adult stages of thought without the (supremely interesting) transitional stage, or else it has preserved only its more adult records, or else it never had any but adult records to show, <i>i.e.</i> it is later literature only.</p>

					<p>Now in the history of philosophy, whether its concepts be sought in the cell and the academy of the originating seer, or in the reaction to his influence in thoughtful and earnest minds, nothing is more illuminating either for chronology or for interpretation, than to catch the intelligence in the act of ascending to a fresh vantage-point in its interpretation of the world — </p>

							<p class="in2"><i>... dhammamayaṃ, Sumedha<br />
							pāsādaṃ āruyha, Samantacakkhu ...<br />
							avekkhassu!</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And since no auspicious day amid Egyptian or trans-Aegean ruins has brought back to us Leukippus or Demokritus, the Buddhist <i>Piṭakas,</i> by presenting this evolutionary moment, possess a unique interest for the historian of human ideas: not only in India, but in the entire world of culture.</p>

But since we have the alternative term 'sensation," since Buddhaghosa himself emphasizes the different aspect: <i>dvārato vedanā vuttā</i> ('the <i>vedanā</i> mentioned refers to sense,' <i>Vis. Mag.</i>), — and since other translators are unanimous in using 'sensation,' this rendering is followed here.

If the psychological comments of Buddhaghosa on these two expressions in the <i>Sammoha-Vinodani</i> and the <i>Sumangala</i> <i>Vilāsinī</i> be a correct guide to the Buddha's utterance, then the passage under consideration reveals what would now be called a psycho-physiological standpoint of much interest. The 'modes ... exponents' of 'name' are not physical expressions, but the processes of subjective consciousness, — feelings, perceptions, etc. The consciousness, bent back upon itself — <i>piṭṭhivaṭṭakā hutvā</i> — <i>refoulé sur soí-méme</i> — gives the name to what it finds.

					<p class="lgqt">The <i>Cy.</i> sums up the relation, between <i>nāma-rūpa</i> and <i>phasso</i> as follows: — In the channels of the five senses, sight, hearing, etc., by means of visual and other objects, are the 'form,' while the [other four] <i>skandhas,</i> brought into relation therewith, are the 'name'. Thus in a fivefold way is name-and-form the cause of contact. Moreover in the channel of the sixth sense (<i>mano,</i> ideation) its physical basis, — the heart — as well as such corporeal form as becomes its mental object, constitute 'form,' while the related states of consciousness induced, as well as such incorporeal form as becomes its mental object, constitute incorporeal form. Thus in saying that name-and-form is the cause of contact, we must also include contact that is mental (i.e. of ideas). Name-and-form is therefore in many ways the cause of contact.

Accordingly it is, in the <i>Cy.,</i> paraphrased as follows: — 'having entered, <i>so to speak,</i> and staying (<i>vattamānaṃ</i> = the Latin idiom, <i>versatum est</i>), by means of conception, were not to keep going on.' The contradictory term, <i>vokkamissatha,</i> 'become extinct,' rendered by Warren 'go away again,' is paraphrased <i>nirujjhissatha,</i> and only signifies that the advent is in some way annulled. There is no concept of cognition, as a unity, descending from outside into the womb like a ball into a bag. At <i>Saṃyutta</i> V, 283 we are told of happiness descending on a man, and at <i>Mil.</i> 299 of drowsiness descending into or on to a man. So <i>okkantikā pīti</i> is a standing expression for a particular sort of joy.

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup></span> The argument in this paragraph seems to have appealed in a special degree to the early Buddhists, for it has been made the basis of a whole Suttanta, the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p7"><i>Jāliya</i></a> (which is itself repeated, occurring first as part of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p6"><i>Mahāli,</i></a> and then again separately). The main point there emphasized is that the converted man will have gone so far beyond them that all such questions will have ceased to interest him. The two other Suttantas have been translated in full in Vol. I; but see especially <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#pg200">pp. 200-5.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup></span> The <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p33">Sangīti Suttanta ('Dialogues,' III)</a> and <i>A.</i> IV, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p41">39,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p42">40</a> also name seven. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p54"><i>S.</i> III, 54</a> gives only four.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup></span> The Pali thus rendered is <i>ṭhiti</i> and <i>āyatanaṃ</i> respectively. The <i>Cy.</i> paraphrases the first by 'this is an equivalent for a setting-up (<i>patiṭṭhāna</i>) of <i>viññāṇa.' Patiṭṭhānaṃ</i> is the affording of a standing-place, resting-place, <i>locus standi,</i> or foothold for. <i>Ṭhiti</i> again, is the term for the central, static moment in any process, contrasting with two others in the same category, viz. inception and dying-out. 'Rest' is not satisfactory, but no English term suggests itself which exactly meets the requirement. For 'sphere' the paraphrase is simply: — <i>'nivāsana-ṭ-ṭhānaṃ,'</i> dwelling-place, ... 'These are included to exhaust [the contents] of the Cycle (<i>saṇsāra</i>), for the Cycle goes not on merely by way of <i>viññāṇa</i>-resting places.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup></span> No two human beings, says the <i>Cy.,</i> are ever exactly alike; even in twins that are undistinguishable in likeness of appearance and complexion, there will be some difference in look, speech, gait or carriage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup></span> The <i>Cy.</i> refers the inquirer to the <i>Vis. Mag.</i> for further comment. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">next Suttanta,</a> and <i>Dh.S.,</i> §§ 265-8; trans., pp. 71-5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup></span> <i>Saññā</i> perhaps awareness would be a better rendering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup></span> The <i>Cy.</i> here includes cognition with awareness, the extreme tenuity or refinement (<i>sukhumattaṃ</i>) of both being in this sphere such that it is as a zero point between presence and absence of either. See passage last cited in previous note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup></span> Or the peril of it (<i>ādīnavo</i>), <i>i. e.</i> the thought of its impermanence, changeableness, etc. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup></span> This standpoint of insight into the limitations of all sentient experience when estimated according to its emotional or hedonistic values is claimed by the Buddha as a monopoly of his own doctrine, distinguishing it from other ethical systems. See his graphic exposition in the <i>Great Suttanta on the Body of Ill;</i> and the passages quoted under <a href="../../../resources/dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn15_yathabutam.jpg"><i>Yathābhūtam</i> in the Saṃyutta Index (vol. vi)</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup></span> <i>Paññā vimutto,</i> i.e. says the <i>Cy.</i> 'emancipated without the aid of the following eight grades of deliverance' — by native insight. So <i>PP.</i> 14, 73. Here, as throughout, when <i>paññā</i> is rendered by 'reason,' it is but a <i>pìs-aller</i>. <i>Paññā</i> is really intellect as conversant with, engaged upon, general truths, and thus comes out as approximately Kant's <i>Vernunft,</i> and Reason as distinct from Understanding, a distinction very general in English and European philosophy. See <i>Dh.S.,</i> transl., p. 17, <i>n.</i> 2. By 'emancipated' the <i>Cy.</i> understands 'having effected the non-perpetuity (in rebirths) of name and form.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup></span> <i>Vimokhā.</i> See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">the following Suttanta,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.16.pali.bd.htm#pg111">p. 111 of the text;</a> <i>A.</i> IV, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p66">306,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p96">349;</a> <i>Dh.S.,</i> §§ 248-50; transl., pp. 63-5. Buddhaghosa's comments on the last citation are approximately the same as those on the first three stages here given. Here, too, he explains Release as deliverance from adverse conditions, so that the attention is sustained with all the detachment and confidence felt by the little child borne on his father's hip, his limbs dangling, and no need felt to clutch. In the first stage, <i>Jhāna</i> is induced by intense concentration on the <i>colour</i> of some bodily feature. In the second, the <i>kasiṇa</i> is an object external to one's body. In the third, consciousness of an uprising glamour (around or superseding the <i>kasiṇa</i>) of perfectly pure colour or lustre is meant. The <i>aesthetic</i> suffusion was held to quicken the sense of emancipation from <i>morally</i> adverse conditions analogously to that perception of ethical rapture induced by the Four Divine or Sublime Moods, described in the Mahā Sudassana Suttanta. The <i>Paṭisambhidāmagga</i> is again referred to by the <i>Cy.,</i> viz. II, p. 39, in this connexion. The curious thing is that in reply to the question, 'How is there release thus: — "How lovely it is — with this thought he becomes intent?"' — the reply is simply and solely the Formula of the Four Sublime Moods.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup></span> The 4th-7th stages were afterwards known as the Four <i>Āruppa Jānas,</i> or the four <i>Jhānas</i> to be cultivated for attaining to the Formless Heavens (see <i>Dh.S.,</i> §§ 265 ff.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup></span> <i>Ubhato-bhāga-vimutto</i> i.e. freed both by Reason and also by the inteliectual discipline of the Eight Stages. According to a scholastic elaboration of the term, emanating from the <i>Giri-vihāra</i> of the great <i>Loha-pāsāda</i> (or Brazen Palace), 'both ways' meant the Four <i>Jhānas</i> and the <i>Āruppa-jhānas</i>. How this can be reconciled with this paragraph — confirmed by <i>PP.</i> 14 and 73 and by <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg477"><i>M.</i> I, 477-8</a> is not stated. 'Taints' are the Four <i>Āsavas,</i> rendered 'Intoxicants' above, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm#fn64">p. 28, <i>n.</i> 2.</a></p>

RD omits translating the <i>"eva dutiyaṃ"</i> and groups the two with the seven which obscures a distinction that was likely made for a reason. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/09_nines/an09.024.hare.pts.htm">AN 9.24</a> has the nine grouped together under the one heading, but with the sphere of non-percipience as #5.
