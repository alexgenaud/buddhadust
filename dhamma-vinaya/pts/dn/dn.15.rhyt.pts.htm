					<p>THE doctrine of Paṭicca-samuppāda — that all dhammā (phenomena physical and mental) are <i>paṭiccasamuppannā</i> (happen by way of cause) finds in the following Suttanta the fullest exposition accorded to it throughout the Piṭakas. It is true that for some reason (cf. p. 26, <i>n.</i>1) the Dīghabhā<i>n</i>akas (recorders of the Dīgha-Nikāya) excluded the first two of the Twelve Nidānas — <i>avijjā, sankhārā</i> — and that, in the Paccayākāra-vibhanga of the Abhidhamma, the formula is reiterated and analysed with greater variety of presentation. But in the present instance the doctrinal contents are more fully worked out. There is another feature in this Dīgha exposition which seems to us of no little significance.</p>

					<p>But before discussing this feature, we would point to yet another factor in the statement of the chain of the Nidānas which does not find a place in the Nidāna-Suttanta. This is the schematized, or abstract formula of the whole sequence, showing the logic of it without the contents — 'That being thus, this comes to be, from the coming to be of that, this arises. That being absent, this does not happen, from the cessation of that, this ceases.' (M. II, 32.) In the other Nikāyas the scheme usually precedes the full formula, and in one case where the principle of the latter is called 'the Dhamma,' <i>supersedes</i> the formula. It is on all fours with the modern formulation of the law of causation — 'That every event is the result or sequel of some previous event, or events, without which it could not have happened, and which, being present, it must take place.'</p>

					<p>The significant feature is this: — although the formula, as expounded in this Suttanta, ends in the usual way — 'Such is the uprising of this whole body of Ill' — the burden of the Dialogue is in no way directly concerned with Ill, pain or sorrow. In certain other passages, on the other hand, where the Nidāna-chain occurs, dukkha occupies the foreground. Thus in A.I, 177, the formula of the Paṭicca-samuppāda is rehearsed to explain the Aryan Truth of the uprising of Ill.</p>

					<p><a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> In M. I, 190 the context of the formula is an exhortation by Sāriputta on the primary importance of a right attitude towards, and understanding of, the nature and causes of Ill, so that the brethren may meet persecutions — ills not due to their own ill deeds — with fortitude and serenity. In the Nidāna Saɱyutta of the Saɱyutta-Nikāya, all the contexts of the formula known to the compilers are grouped together. Of the ninety-three brief Suttas of which this division consists, only one-sixth of those in which the formula occurs, have Dukkha (or its opposite) for their subject. A <i>slightly</i> larger <i>proportion</i> of the Suttas (16) are so many statements upholding the truth of the evolution of phenomena by way of natural causation. That any being exists absolutely and eternally is at the same time denied. And that any being ever perishes absolutely is equally denied. Of the remaining Suttas, four, in which Loka, the world of sense-perception, is substituted in the Paṭicca-samuppāda for Dukkha, belong virtually to the foregoing sixteen. Seven are concerned with rebirth, eight are ethical exhortations to destroy Craving, and <i>thirty-six</i> emphasize the importance of mastering the <i>principle</i> of the Paṭicca-samuppāda. That holds the key to insight; to understand it is therefore the test of true knowledge and sound doctrine. This too is the point in Saɱyutta V, 387-9, where the formula again occurs. Once more, in the very strongly emphasized rehearsal of the formula in the 'Great Taṇha-sankhaya-Sutta' of M. I, 256, the doctrine there inculcated is not in any way hedonistic, sentimental or, directly, moral. It has nothing to say about Dukkha. It is a repudiation of the belief in any permanent, transmigrating intelligent principle (<i>viññāṇa</i>) in man, and the affirmation of the contrary view-that <i>viññāṇa</i> is a contingent phenomenon, a happening by way of cause and effect, something that 'becomes' and dies away.</p>

					<p>Dukkha, on the other hand, and the causes of it — 'evam ... samudayo' — holds, in nearly every case, the last word in this notable formula. And according to the Buddhist records, as told in the preceding Suttanta, the fact and sequence of those causes dawn ever on the mind of every Buddha in response to the anguished questionings of his mind brooding over the misery of the world, and of the infinite living and dying in it.</p>

					<p>Hence in trying to account adequately for the profound significance and high importance attached by the founders of Buddhism to the doctrine of the Paṭicca-samuppāda, we need to keep in view this dual aspect of it — that it is a way of explaining phenomena, and that the most interesting phenomenon <a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> to be explained is that of Dukkha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> The latter standpoint is that of man as recipient or percipient, the former, that of man as intellective or interpreting.</p>

					<p>Now if to this twofold aspect we add that of man as reacting, by will and deed, to his impressions and his interpretations, and take the Buddha's doctrine of the Eightfold Path, as the corresponding formula, we have not only the whole of Early Buddhism in a nutshell, but also just those points concerning which we find the most emphatic affirmations of Dhamma as Dhamma ascribed to Gotama — </p>

					<p>'Both in the past and now do I set forth <i>just this:</i> — "dukkha and the cessation of dukkha."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'Let us put aside questions of the Beginning and the End. I will teach you the Dhamma: — That being thus, this comes to be. From the coming to be of that, this arises. That being absent, this does not happen. From the cessation of that, this ceases.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>'There is a Middle Path ... discovered by the Tathāgata (discovered by none but a Tathāgata, S. V, 14) ... this Aryan Eightfold Path ... .'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> This Path, my friend, <i>is</i> the religious life (<i>brahmacariya</i>).'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>These three central tenets are put, by our earliest and best authorities, in these or other words, into the mouth of Gotama himself at the very outset of his career, in his first sermon, as the doctrine of the Four Aryan or Noble Truths. And the Paṭicca-samuppāda, with its positive formula of uprising (<i>Samudaya</i>), and its negative formula of passing away (<i>Nirodha</i>), covers the ground staked out by the second and third of these Truths. It is frequently quoted in this connexion,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and its importance in the Dhamma is thereby made the more evident.</p>

					<p>But the reason for that importance only becomes clear, when we look away from the dukkha to which the formula is <a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> so often applied, away too from the antecedents of dukkha, and consider all that is implied in the Paṭicca-samuppāda by way of method and <i>Weltanschauung</i>.</p>

					<p>If we persist in viewing either Dukkha or its causes as the 'secret' of the doctrine, we might omit the formula altogether, since the nature and cause and effect of each <i>nidāna</i> is fully taught in each Nikāya. Nor is the order of sequence the main tenet. Frequent liberties are taken in the Canon with both order and number of <i>nidānas.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> Nor finally could the arrangement of antecedents and consequences in an iterated rigmarole (convenient for oral transmission) appeal with the runic force of a Shibboleth to a movement of thought like that of Buddhism, any more than would the similarly arranged fragment of formula contained in the Sānkhya Kārikā have appealed, as such, to the followers of that school. No reformers who so carefully purged their literature of all the 'eulalic' reiterations of Om! Hari! and the rest, that so throng the pages of the Upanishads, would care a brass farthing for any 'accumulative jingle' accounting for things after the fashion of the widely spread pre-historic folk-rune, 'The cat began to kill the rat, the rat began to gnaw the rope,' etc. ... '<i>and so</i> the old woman got home that night.' <i>Evam etassa, etc.</i></p>

					<p>It was not the fact of Dukkha, nor the fairly obvious conditions of birth and so on, leading up to it, that come as a revelation to each Buddha, beneath his Bo-tree. It was the process of <i>samudaya</i> and <i>nirodha</i> as a natural and universal law. 'Coming to pass! Coming to pass! At that thought there arose in me a Vision into things not called before to mind, and knowledge arose, insight, wisdom, light arose.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> Not uncaused and casually, nor by the fiat of Icvara — Indra, Soma, Varuna, Brahmā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> — did events happen, painful or otherwise; not as Job and the Psalmist taught — 'God distributeth sorrows in his anger.'  For 'God is a righteous judge, and God is angry every day.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Events came impelled by preceding conditions, causes that man could by intelligence and good will, study and govern, suspend or intensify.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> Thus Buddhaghosa, in explaining the name Paṭicca-samuppāda,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> points out that it <i>excludes</i> all theories of absolutism, nihilism, chance, irregular causation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>, and indeterminism.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> And of such theories, it is concerning the implied rejection of the first two that he is most explicit. Namely, that there is no persistent ego reaping results in one life sown as causes in a previous life, and that it is not a different, an alien ego either, which reaps. The latter person (<i>attabhāva</i>) is the resultant, the creature, the 'evolute' of the former. Thus faithfully was the tradition of the Piṭakas preserved, wherein the view of <i>viññāṇa</i> a as a persistent ego was categorically contradicted in the words <i>aneka-pariyāyena paṭiccasamuppanna</i> (causally evolved in various ways). M. I, 256.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Let it be remembered that the 'immanent' absolutism opposed by Buddhism was chiefly the Brahmanic theosophy. According to this, the ¢tman of the individual was not so much an efflux of the World-¡tman, as was the latter immanent in, and identified with, each man-soul. 'In the beginning this world was only Soul, in the shape of a man ... world-guardian, world-lord, this that is My Soul.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> 'My Soul' was therefore, in that theosophy, the personal First <a id="pg47"><span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span></a> Cause, and Final Cause. And hence the Paṭicca-samuppāda of Buddhism was as decided a negation of all teleology as was the theorem of Demokritus and his master Leukippus 'that nothing happens by chance, but everything through a cause and of necessity.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Had the fates been kinder to the writings of the Atomist of Abdera, had the 'teleological reaction' not been led by two men of such extraordinary genius as Plato and Aristotle, it is conceivable that the whole philosophy, not to say the Dhamma, of the West, might hate flowed along a channel in which the influence of the <i>mikros</i> and the <i>megas Diakosmos</i> might have brought both that philosophy and that Dhamma more nearly parallel to the informing principle of the Paṭicca-samuppāda. As it happened, Europe learned from Athens compromise and comprehensiveness, learned to believe in a universe governed partly by necessity and partly by chance, learned to combine belief in unchanging natural law with belief in first and final causes.</p>

					<p>And so gradually has the realm of regular, causal sequence encroached upon that of the casual and the arbitrary, that on no period in the intellectual development of Europe can we place our finger and say: — Here the concept of a universe governed, as to its every movement and happening, by natural causation, was brought home to the minds of men, — to the mind of one man. There is nothing resembling the intellectual earthquake caused half a century ago by that extension of the law of causation: the theory of evolution. Or was there some such milestone of rational development reached, when Demokritus formulated the philosophy of Atomism, and won renown as a great prophet and teacher of mankind?</p>

					<p>In the history of Indian thought, on the other hand, we can point to such an epoch-making crisis, we can discern the significance of the law of universal causation breaking in on a great mind with a flash of intuition. The law, we read, stands as fundamental, whether Tathāgatas have arisen or not. But the Tathāgata penetrates and masters it, and delivers the knowledge thereof to the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> No such crisis of thought is patent in the literature of the Brahmins, though that literature extends over practically the whole era of Indian culture. Those Upanishads which are ranked as the oldest show a naïf animism: those ranked later reveal thought attained to relative maturity,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> But there is no evidence of a transition causing a mental upheaval. In the seventy-two stanzas of the S¢nkhya K¢rik¢, again, 25 per cent contain some consciously generalized affirmation respecting cause and effect. The abstract causal concept shows as a well-matured instrument of metaphysical thought. Throughout the Yoga Sûtra too we find allusions to causality as an abstract idea.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> It is only in the Buddhist Nikāyas that we come up against the actual effort itself of the human mind to get at a more scientific view of world-order, — an effort which is marked with the freshness and vigour of a new fetch of intellectual expansion, and the importance and gravity of which is affirmed with the utmost emphasis, both in the earliest records and in the orthodox literature of ten centuries later.</p>

					<p>The significance of the Piṭakas, as the vehicle of this evolutionary cry of travail and new birth, is not minimized by the objection, that a gospel promulgated by laymen (<i>Khattiyas</i>), and preached to the man in the street, would naturally regard, as truths new and wonderful, axioms which, to the more esoteric, philosophical schools of the day, were the commonplaces of dialectical metaphysic. For we have shown that, in the one case where such a school has preserved its ancient literature, we find books of pre-causational and post-causational thought, but nothing indicating that the conviction of a law of universal natural causation was taking birth. The aphorisms, constituting the oldest existing survivals of Yoga and S¢nkhya thought, reveal no inner evolution of philosophic progress, and no traces of early animistic culture such as appear in certain of the Upanishads. Most of the Jain literature still awaits it editor, but we have Dr. Jacobi's learned authority for it, that, in spite of an atomistic theory of some interest, its philosophy was crude, animistic and mere 'common <a id="pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> sense.' It is not likely therefore that the Angas which are still inedited will reveal any conception of causation possessing deep philosophical insight. Hence all early Indian literature, for which any such insight is claimed, except that of Buddhism, either shows both the child-like and the more adult stages of thought without the (supremely interesting) transitional stage, or else it has preserved only its more adult records, or else it never had any but adult records to show, i. e. it is later literature only.</p>

					<p>Now in the history of philosophy, whether its concepts be sought in the cell and the academy of the originating seer, or in the reaction to his influence in thoughtful and earnest minds, nothing is more illuminating either for chronology or for interpretation, than to catch the intelligence in the act of ascending to a fresh vantage-point in its interpretation of the world — </p>

					<p class="in2">... dhammamayaɱ, Sumedha<br />
					pāsādaɱ āruyha, Samantacakkhu ...<br />
					avekkhassu!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And since no auspicious day amid Egyptian or trans-Aegean ruins has brought back to us Leukippus or Demokritus, the Buddhist Piṭakas, by presenting this evolutionary moment, possess a unique interest for the historian of human ideas: not only in India, but in the entire world of culture.</p>

To us it seems that precisely for this reason it would be the object of the quest of him men called the Naruttama, the Aggapuggala — the supreme Man — who combined 'philosophical curiosity' or rather, insight, with the practical bent of a saviour of men.</p>

But the mobile, plastic, evolutionary thing, ever in progress, that life appears as conceived by the Indian, fits ill in the more rigid Western metaphysic of Being.

D. in 'Buddhism,' March, 1904, pp. 389, 390; Rangoon). Moreover, according to the Vibhanga (p. 137) the <i>bhava</i> which is the cause of birth is not only <i>uppattibhavo,</i> — the becoming which is 'coming into sentient being' of some sort — but also <i>kammabhavo,</i> or the generating of effective actions, effective in good or bad results, or in result which is 'beyond good and bad,' viz. meritorious activity, demeritorious activity, and 'unmoved' or 'static activity' (<i>āneñjabhisankhāro</i>).

Now the term 'feeling,' in its widest psychological meaning (namely, as consisting essentially in our <i>being affected</i> or <i>acted upon</i>), is able to bear this connotation as well as the more emotional aspect. But since we have the alternative term 'sensation," since Buddhaghosa himself emphasizes the different aspect: <i>dvārato vedanā vuttā</i> ('the <i>vedanā</i> mentioned refers to sense,' Vis. Mag.), — and since other translators are unanimous in using 'sensation,' this rendering is followed here. In Sum.

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup></span> This and the nine following sections constitute a digression in the exposition of the chain which is thus explained by the Cy.

The former, with the remaining links, is now put aside, 'as if one were putting a clamorous person out of the road, hitting him on the back and seizing his hair.' And the latter is discussed under the twofold subdivision of craving in the quest, and craving in the found quarry — seeking and gloating over.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup></span> <i>Rūpakāye adhivacanasamphasso.</i> This and its complement the <i>paṭighasamphasso</i> in 'name' (rendered 'impression of sense-reaction') occur in the Vibhanga, p. 6, as two modes of <i>saññā,</i> or perception, the former being described as refined, subtle, delicate, the latter as gross, coarse, thick. If the psychological comments of Buddhaghosa on these two expressions in the Sammoha-Vinodani and the Sumangala <span class="spi">Vilāsinī</span> be a correct guide to the Buddha's utterance, then the passage under consideration reveals what would now be called a psycho-physiological standpoint of much interest. The' modes ... exponents' of 'name' are not physical expressions, but the processes of subjective consciousness, — feelings, perceptions, etc. The consciousness, bent back upon itself — <i>piṭṭhivaṭṭakā hutvā</i> — refoulée sur soí-méme — gives the name to what it finds. The modes, etc., of 'form' are the modes of sensation, by which 'form manifests itself' to the mind, — ' at the mind-door,' as the Cr. has it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup></span> See Dh. S., translation, p. 172, <i>n.</i> 1, 183, <i>n.</i> 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup></span> i. e. of this twofold contact, as the Cy. points out, of mental object with mind-activity or mind, and of sense-object with sense-organ. Cf. Dh. S., §§ 3-5, and translation, p. 5, <i>n.</i> 2. The former mode of contact is there called <i>ceto-samphasso, manoviññāṇadhātusamphasso.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Cy. sums up the relation, between <i>nāmarūpa</i> and <i>phasso</i> as follows: — In the channels of the five senses, sight, hearing, etc., by means of visual and other objects, are the 'form,' while the [other four] <i>skandhas,</i> brought into relation therewith, are the 'name'. Thus in a fivefold way is name-and-form the cause of contact. Moreover in the channel of the sixth sense (<i>mano,</i> ideation) its physical basis, — the heart — as well as such corporeal form as becomes its mental object, constitute 'form,' while the related states of consciousness induced, as well as such incorporeal form as becomes its mental object, constitute incorporeal form. Thus in saying that name-and-form is the cause of contact, we must also include contact that is mental (i.e. of ideas). Name-and-form is therefore in many ways the cause of contact. (On the heart, see Dh. S., translation, p. lxxviii; Pras. Up. III, 1, 5.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup></span> The animistic implication adhering to this term (<i>okkamissatha; ava,</i> down + √<i>kram,</i> stride) would of course have no significance for Buddhist doctrine. Accordingly it is, in the Cy., paraphrased as follows: — 'having entered, <i>so to speak,</i> and staying (<i>vattamānaɱ</i> = the Latin idiom, <i>versatum est</i>), by means of conception, were not to keep going on.' The contradictory term, <i>vokkamissatha,</i> 'become extinct,' rendered by Warren 'go away again,' is paraphrased <i>nirujjhissatha,</i> and only signifies that the advent is in some way annulled. There is no concept of cognition, as a unity, descending from outside into the womb like a ball into a bag. At Saɱyutta V, 283 we are told of happiness descending on a man, and at Mil. 299 of drowsiness descending into or on to a man. So okkantikā pīti is a standing expression for a particular sort of joy. In each of these cases the bliss, or drowsiness, or joy is supposed to develop from within; and so also here of cognition.</p>

So also Oldenberg 'Buddha,' p. 259; and Windisch, 'Buddha's Geburt,' p. 39. The Cy. has <i>kalalādi-bhāvena ... missibhūtaɱ hutvā</i>, 'become mixed with the embryo in its different stages.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup></span> The doctrine of origin by way of cause having now been set forth, the following is, according to the Cy., an illustration of how 'this generation has become a tangled skein,' etc., as asserted above (§ 1). These different impressions as to the nature of the <i>attā</i> (ātman), soul, or mannikin, are, according to the Cy., deductions from <i>Jhāna</i> experience. For instance, in the first 'declaration,' 'he who, on gazing at a particular <i>kasiṇa'</i> (one of ten kinds of objects for inducing meditative rapture); 'gets hold of an after-image where there is no expansion (<i>avaḍḍhitaɱ</i>), and of a consciousness that "it is the soul," declares that it, the soul, has form and is minute' — and so on.

These take the <i>kasiṇas</i> for what they are, and, for them, the constituents of mind (the four <i>khandhas</i>) are such and no more.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup></span> These three forms of the 'individuality-heresy' amount to an interesting and metaphysically more discriminating statement of the oft-quoted theories identifying the soul or mannikin with one or other or the five <i>Khandhas</i>. (See Vin. I, 13 ('Vin. Texts,' I, 100); M. I, 138, 300; S. III, 66; IV, 34, etc.) According to the Cy., the second assertion is the identification with the body (<i>rūpakkhandhavatthukā</i>), which is usualIy placed first; the third assertion includes identification of the soul with the other three Khandhas — with, let us say, thinking and volition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup></span> <i>Saṇkhata,</i> con-fected, composite, the resultant of conditions. The soul, according to the then current animism, was considered to be unique, not a product, not causally modifiable through temporal or spatial conditions. The commentary explains <i>saṇkhata</i> as 'that which, having through such and such causes (lit. doings) come together, is made.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup></span> All the MSS. agree in putting this answer in the mouth of Ānanda, instead of in that of the soul-theorist. And it would be quite like him to rush in, in this way, with his opinion. And so also below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup></span> <i>Parinibkhāyati.</i> Usually rendered 'he attains complete Nirvana' or 'attains <i>Parinirvāna,</i>' or even 'enters Nirvana.' The term is applied to the death of an Arahant, but it is also used to express perfected tranquillity, as in the case of a horse (M. I, 446), or of a man (M. I, 251; S. III, 54). Tradition, as represented by the Cy., did not associate the hour of death with the term, for it says, 'Having thus completely parinibbāna-ed (by extinguishing all evil) he goes on to reflect, " Birth is at an end,", etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup></span> Tathāgata; perhaps it merely means 'mortal.' See M. I, 542.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup></span> The argument in this paragraph seems to have appealed in a special degree to the early Buddhists, for it has been made the basis of a whole Suttanta, the <i>Jāliya</i> (which is itself repeated, occurring first as part of the <i>Mahāli,</i> and then again separately). The main point there emphasized is that the converted man will have gone so far beyond them that all such questions will have ceased to interest him. The two other Suttantas have been translated in full in Vol. I; but see especially pp. 200-5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup></span> The Sangīti Suttanta ('Dialogues,' III) and A. IV, 39, 40 also name seven. S. III, 54 gives only four.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup></span> The Pali thus rendered is <i>ṭhiti</i> and <i>āyatanaɱ</i> respectively. The Cy. paraphrases the first by 'this is an equivalent for a setting-up (<i>patiṭṭhāna</i>) of <i>viññāṇa.' Patiṭṭhānaɱ</i> is the affording of a standing-place, resting-place, <i>locus standi,</i> or foothold for. <i>Ṭhiti</i> again, is the term for the central, static moment in any process, contrasting with two others in the same category, viz. inception and dying-out. 'Rest' is not satisfactory, but no English term suggests itself which exactly meets the requirement. For 'sphere' the paraphrase is simply: — <i>'nivāsanaṭṭhānaɱ,'</i> dwelling-place, ... 'These are included to exhaust [the contents] of the Cycle (<i>saŋsāra</i>), for the Cycle goes not on merely by way of <i>viññāṇa</i>-resting places.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup></span> No two human beings, says the Cy., are ever exactly alike; even in twins that are undistinguishable in likeness of appearance and complexion, there will be some difference in look, speech, gait or carriage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup></span> Cf. Dh. S., §§ 160 ff., 266 ff.; transl., pp. lxxxvii-ix, 43 ff., 72 ff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup></span> Ranking sixth in the heavens of Rūpabrahmaloka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup></span> Ranking ninth in the same.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup></span> The Cy. refers the inquirer to the Vis. Mag. for further comment. Cf. next Suttanta, and Dh. S., §§ 265-8; trans., pp. 71-5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup></span> <i>Saññā</i> perhaps awareness would be a better rendering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup></span> The Cy. here includes cognition with awareness, the extreme tenuity or refinement (<i>sukhumattaɱ</i>) of both being in this sphere such that it is as a zero point between presence and absence of either. See passage last cited in previous note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup></span> Or the peril of it (<i>ādīnavo</i>), i. e. the thought of its impermanence, changeableness, etc. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup></span> This standpoint of insight into the limitations of all sentient experience when estimated according to its emotional or hedonistic values is claimed by the Buddha as a monopoly of his own doctrine, distinguishing it from other ethical systems. See his graphic exposition in the Great Suttanta on the Body of Ill; and the passages quoted under <i>Yathābhūtam</i> in the Saɱyutta Index (vol. vi).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup></span> <i>Paññā vimutto,</i> i.e. says the Cy. 'emancipated without the aid of the following eight grades of deliverance' — by native insight. So PP. 14, 73. Here, as throughout, when <i>paññā</i> is rendered by 'reason,' it is but a <i>pìs-aller</i>. <i>Paññā</i> is really intellect as conversant with, engaged upon, general truths, and thus comes out as approximately Kant's <i>Vernunft,</i> and Reason as distinct from Understanding, a distinction very general in English and European philosophy. See Dh. S., transl., p. 17, <i>n.</i> 2. By 'emancipated' the Cy. understands 'having effected the non-perpetuity (in rebirths) of name and form.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup></span> <i>Vimokhā.</i> See the following Suttanta, p. 111 of the text; A. IV, 306, 349; Dh. S., §§ 248-50; transl., pp. 63-5. Buddhaghosa's comments on the last citation are approximately the same as those on the first three stages here given. Here, too, he explains Release as deliverance from adverse conditions, so that the attention is sustained with all the detachment and confidence felt by the little child borne on his father's hip, his limbs dangling, and no need felt to clutch. In the first stage, <i>Jhāna</i> is induced by intense concentration on the <i>colour</i> of some bodily feature. In the second, the <i>kasiṇa</i> is an object external to one's body. In the third, consciousness of an uprising glamour (around or superseding the <i>kasiṇa</i>) of perfectly pure colour or lustre is meant. The <i>aesthetic</i> suffusion was held to quicken the sense of emancipation from <i>morally</i> adverse conditions analogously to that perception of ethical rapture induced by the Four Divine or Sublime Moods, described in the Mahā Sudassana Suttanta. The <i>Paṭisambhidāmagga</i> is again referred to by the Cy., viz. II, p. 39, in this connexion. The curious thing is that in reply to the question, 'How is there release thus: — "How lovely it is — with this thought he becomes intent?"' — the reply is simply and solely the Formula of the Four Sublime Moods.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup></span> The 4th-7th stages were afterwards known as the Four <i>Āruppa Jānas,</i> or the four <i>Jhānas</i> to be cultivated for attaining to the Formless Heavens (see Dh. S., §§ 265 ff.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup></span> <i>Ubhato-bhāga-vimutto</i> i.e. freed both by Reason and also by the inteliectual discipline of the Eight Stages. According to a scholastic elaboration of the term, emanating from the <i>Giri-vihāra</i> of the great <i>Loha-pāsāda</i> (or Brazen Palace), 'both ways' meant the Four <i>Jhānas</i> and the <i>Āruppa-jhānas</i>. How this can be reconciled with this paragraph — confirmed by PP. 14 and 73 and by M. I, 477-8 is not stated. 'Taints' are the Four <i>Āsavas,</i> rendered 'Intoxicants' above, p. 28, <i>n.</i> 2.</p>
