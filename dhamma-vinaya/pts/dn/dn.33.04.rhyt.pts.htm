					(2) What is exertion in elimination? Herein, brethren, a brother, when a sensual, malign, or cruel thought has arisen, will not endure it, but puts it away, suppresses, exterminates it and makes it non-existent. Such an <a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> exertion is called exertion in elimination.<br />
					(3) What is exertion in developing?
