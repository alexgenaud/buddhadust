					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Cf. I, 65 f., where the 'fruits' are differently, less technically less eschatologically described; and above, p. 124, § 25, where they agree with the present description.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Cf. Bud. Psy. Eth., p 61 f. B. gives as a special aspect under which sections xāi-xv. are to be regarded, 'their [relative] grossness and subtlety by way of harsh or pleasant basis' (lūkhapaṇītavatthuvasena)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Cf. S. III, 53, where B.'s comment is fuller: consciousness, functioning by the other four khandhas, eventuates in action; action (karma) entails rebirth, hence increase or propagation of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Agatiɱ gacchati, literally, he goes to a not-going, or wrong going, or impasse. See above, XXIX, § 26; XXXI, 5.<br />
					<span class="f2">[mo: from: XXIX § 26:<br />
					"The brother who is arahant, in whom the intoxicants are destroyed, who has lived the life, who has done his task, who has laid low his burden, who has attained salvation, who has utterly destroyed the fetter of rebirth, who is emancipated by the true gnosis, he is incapable of perpetrating nine things:--<br />
					1. He is incapable of deliberately depriving a living creature of life.<br />
					2. He is incapable of taking what is not given so that it constitutes theft.<br />
					3. He is incapable of sexual impurity.<br />
					4. He is incapable of deliberately telling lies.<br />
					5. He is incapable of laying up treasure for indulgence in worldly pleasure as he used to do in the life of the house.<br />
					6. He is incapable of taking a wrong course through partiality.<br />
					7. He is incapable of taking a wrong course through hate.<br />
					8. He is incapable of taking a wrong course through stupidity.<br />
					9. He is incapable of taking a wrong course through fear.<br />

					By which four motives does he do no evil deed? Evil deeds are done from motives of partiality, enmity, stupidity and fear.]</span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Bhavābhavo, existence-nonexistence, is an idiomatic expression for future life or annihilation, e.g. Sutta Nipāta, 496 (and Comy.); or higher or lower rebirth, Psalms of the Brethren, verse 784. Here, according to B., it means oil, honey, ghee, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> See XXVII, § 10.
					[mo: from XXVII, § 10:
					"...unsurpassable is the way in which the Exalted One teaches the norm concerning rates of progress:--that there are four such rates of progress...In the first case, progress is  reckoned as bad both from difficulty and slowness; in the second case, progress is reckoned as bad from its difficulty. In the third case, progress is reckoned as bad from slowness. In the fourth case, progress is reckoned as excellent because of both ease and swiftness."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> I.e., when engaged in concentration (samādhi), are cold and other hardships endured? Are sensuous thoughts tolerated? Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Namely, when jhāna, insight, a Path, a Fruit, Nibbāna is reached.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> (1) is the course followed by ascetics (acelakas); (2) is that of the religious student handicapped by passions but tearfully persevering; (3) is that of the sensualist; (4) that of the recluse in the Order, even though he be lacking in comforts. Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Read paññā- for puññā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> B. says these are discussed in the 'Mahāpadesa kathā.' This is apparently not the sermon on the 'four Mahāpadese' in A. II, 167, nor the brief summary (as above) in A. II, 46, but the sermon on the 'Tiṇi Kathāvatthūni,' in A. I, 197. There is apparently no Mahāpadesa kathā in the Digha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Dark and bright are meant ethically and eschatologically; a parallel pair of terms: tamo, joti, is used in K.S. I, 118 f., and below, <a href="#p4.49">xlix</a>. The fourth alternative is [mental activity in] Fourfold Path-knowledge.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> I.e., by making them present to the eye (paccakkha karaṇena) and acquiring them. Comy. Cf. below, 253. x.<br />
					<span class="f2">[mo: which reads:<br />
					"Three...which are to be realized:--three branches of wisdom, to wit, intuition of former births, intuition of the deceases and rebirths of beings, intuition of the extinction of 'intoxicants.'</span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> I.e., by all co-nascent factors in the nāmakāyo, or mind-group, at any given moment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> By knowledge of the fruit of Arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> Cf. Bud. Psy. Eth., p. 305, <i>n.</i> 1. B. repeats the same comment in both Commentaries.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> Cf. above XXVIII, § 5. [mo. which is the same, but where sampajano is consistently translated "knowing".]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> The second of these is illustrated by the slaughter of an animal by a butcher. The other three cases are referred to the decease and rebirth of the devas referred to in Vol. 1, pp. 32 and 33, and of other devas respectively. [See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/dn/dn.01.3.olds.bd_dhamma_1.htm#PartialEternalists">Brahmajala Sutta, Partial Eternalists</a> (scroll down a little)]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> I.e., purified by the virtuous character and motives of the one or the other. B. illustrates (1) by Vessantara's elephant. Jāt. VI, 487. [mo: Jātaka Story #547]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> See above, p. 145. [mo: Vol III, pp145, where it is: "...popularity...giving, by kindly speech, by sagacious conduct and by impartiality..."]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> The Burmese printed edition transposes xli, xlii.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> <i>Mutaɱ,</i> sometimes interpreted as the other three senses, B. is silent. Cf. p. 127, <i>n.</i> 2 [mo: which reads: "Here, as in Papañca Sūdani on Majjhima I, 1, Buddhaghosa clls mutaŋ, mutvā, an equivalent term for the other three senses. And he refers viññātaŋ: discerned, to ideas pleasant and unpleasant. See Buddh. Psychological Ethics, 239, n. 1; and cf. Saɱyutta I, 186: diṭṭhasute paṭighe ca mute ca (cf. Kindred Sayings I, 237, n. 1]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> Literally, become as Brahmā, or at its best. The passage, which occurs in several Suttas, is quoted in the <i>Kathāvatthu</i> (Points, p. 25) by the Animists (Puggalavādins) to justify their asserting the existence of 'a puggala,' or animistic entity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> B. instances (1) Thera Bākula (or Bakkula), who entered the Order at eighty (? too old to convert others), Psalms of the Brethren, p. 159. (2) Upananda, whose bad conduct hindered his own good, though as recluse he helped others, Vin. Texts, e.g., I, 321 f.; III, 392, n. 2. (3) Devadatta the schismatic, and (4) Great Kassapa (see Psalms of the Brethren, p. 359 f.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> See above xxix.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> Interpreted as those in the Four Paths.</p>
