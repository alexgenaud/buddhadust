					<h4><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The general conclusions we have to draw as to the gradual growth of the various books in the Buddhist canon have been stated in <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.010.literature.htm">Chapter X of <i>'Buddhist India.'</i></a> To work out the details of it will be greatly facilitated by tabular statements of the differences and resemblances found in the various books, whether in matters of form or of ideas. The following table gives a list of all such passages in this book as have, so far, been traced elsewhere. Others will, no doubt, be discovered; but those here given will throw some light on the method of construction followed in the book. Only parallel passages are given, passages in which some other book has at least a paragraph or more couched in identical, or almost identical, words.</p>
					
					<p>A glance at column three, giving the pages of the text, shows a remarkable result. There are ninety-six pages of Pali text, beginning on p. 72. With a few gaps - pp. 92, 3; 113-15; 117-21; 130-3; 137-40; 148-50; 153; i58-60; 164-7 (nine in number)-the whole text is found, in nearly identical words, elsewhere. The gaps, filled with matter found only in the Book of the Great Decease, amount altogether to about 32 or 33 pages, that is to about one-third of the whole. That proportion would be reduced if we were to include passages of similar tendency, or passages of shorter length.</p>
					
					<p>Secondly; the parallel passages are found, without exception, in those books which belong to the oldest portion of the canon. In <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.010.literature.htm#pg188">'Buddhist India,' p. 188,</a> there is a table showing, in groups, the probable relative order in time of the Buddhist literature down to the time of Asoka.</p>
					
					<p>All these passages belong to the two earliest groups; all are found in books included in groups 4-6; not one occurs in any of the books included in the later groups - groups 7, 8, 9, and 10. So far as it goes, therefore, the present table is in harmony with the order suggested in the table referred to.</p>
					
					<p>Thirdly; the slight differences, the more important of which</p>

					<p>are noted in the table, are very suggestive. No. 26 is the episode of the stanzas uttered at the moment of the Buddha's death. The Saɱyutta gives it in the Brahma-Saɱyutta because the first verse is attributed to Brahmā. The last two verses are there put into the mouths of Ānanda and Anuruddha respectively, perhaps because Anuruddha's verse forms a more fitting conclusion. In the Dīgha Ānanda's comes last, either in deprecation of Ānanda (which is scarcely probable), or for the reason given in the note to the translation.</p>
					
					<p>In No. 14 we have four lines of verse, and the prose introductory to them, ascribed in the Dīgha to the Buddha, ascribed in the Anguttara to a former teacher whose story is there told by the Buddha. That previous teacher, though not a Buddha, is highly praised in the story; the epithet applied to him in the verses <i>(satthā)</i> is quite in the right place in that connexion; and the verses when spoken by the Buddha of another teacher, are quite appropriate. On the other hand, when put as the Dīgha puts them, into the mouth of the Buddha as spoken of himself, they are not in the best of taste, and sound forced. There can, I think, be no doubt but that the application of these verses to Sunetta the Teacher was the original one, and that the little poem was only later applied to the Buddha himself. But it does not follow in the least that the Anguttara is older than the Dīgha. For, as is shown by the references in the table, the Anguttara itself contains, in an earlier part of the work, the later application of these verses. There it gives the episode, word for word, as it occurs in the Dīgha. The two passages cannot be of the same age. It is not possible that the same story was told originally of two different people. But the two collections <i>(Nikāyas)</i> may very, well have been put together, from older materials of varying age, at the same time.</p>
					
					<p>No. 30 is the episode of the explosion of ill-will on the part of Subhadda. There is a slight but very suggestive difference here between the two texts, one found in our Suttanta the other in the Pañcasatika Khandaka of the Vinaya. For convenience of comparison the two versions of this episode are here reprinted side by side.</p>

And the venerable Mahā Kassapa left the high road, and sat himself down at the foot of a certain tree.</p>
							
							<p>Just at that time a certain ascetic who had picked up a Mandārava flower in Kusinārā was coming along the high road to Pāvā. Now the venerable Mahā Kassapa saw the ascetic coming in the distance, and on seeing him he said to that ascetic:</p>

							<p>'Yea, friend! I know him. This day the Samaṇa Gotama has been dead a week. That is how I obtained this Mandārava flower.'</p>

					<p>A glance at the above columns shows that the two texts are identical except in two particulars. The Dīgha gives the episode in narrative form, whereas the Vinaya puts it into the mouth of Kassapa himself. And secondly, whereas the Dīgha puts Kassapa's speech after the outburst of Subhadda, the Vinaya puts it before - that is, the last two paragraphs in the Dīgha are transposed in the Vinaya.</p>
					
					<p>Professor Oldenberg, who was the first to point out (more than thirty years ago)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn1" href="#in1">i1</a>]</sup></span> the parallelism between the two texts, acutely suggests that the change is due to the position occupied by this episode in the Vinaya. It is there used as introduction to the account of the Council at Rājagaha held, according to the tradition, to counteract such sentiments as were expressed in Subhadda's outburst. It was considered more appropriate, therefore, that in that connexion, Subhadda's words should come last, to lead up to what follows. The whole of the story is accordingly taken from our Suttanta. But the last paragraphs are transposed, and the whole is put into the mouth of Kassapa, on whose advice the Council is stated to have been convened.</p>
					
					<p>This seems a very probable explanation of the transposition, and of the existence of two slightly different accounts of the <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> episode. If we accept it - and I think we should<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn2" href="#in2">i2</a>]</sup></span> - we have to face the further question: Why was the episode inserted in the Dīgha? It is given there in the middle of the account of the cremation of the Buddha at Kusinārā. It has very little to do either with what precedes, or with what follows it; and is said to have taken place away from Kusinārā. The outburst itself was of little importance in the long story of the Buddha's last days; and (in the older order as preserved in the Dīgha) is immediately overwhelmed by Mahā Kassapa's apt quotation from the Master's words. Have we not here a very similar motive, acting on either the same or very similar minds? Is it not precisely the part played by this anecdote in the traditional account of the First Council that led the compilers of the Dīgha to find a place for it in the Book of the Great Decease? They might so easily have left it out. As it stands it only breaks in upon the nairative. And, apart from the tradition about the First Council, it had no importance.</p>
					
					<p>There has been much discussion both for and against the authenticity of this First Council. Is this really necessary? Oldenberg's analysis of the comparative date of the different parts of the Vinaya has shown conclusively that the record, as we have it, is later than the Council of Vesālī, that is at least a hundred years later than the meeting whose proceedings it purports to record. What can be the value of so late a record? It may be objected to this that though the extant record is late the tradition may be older. No one can prove that it was not. But this would not help matters at all. We must then point out that the details as given are, as one might expect, quite inaccurate.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn3" href="#in3">i3</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p>Space will only allow of one example being taken.</p>
					
					<p>It is well known that all the ancient sacred literatures of the world have grown up gradually, and are a mosaic of earlier <a id="pg77"><span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></a> and later material. The Buddhist Piṭakas form no exception. As regards the Nikāyas I have shown this elsewhere in considerable detail.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn4" href="#in4">i4</a>]</sup></span> Now the record, as we have it, presupposes the existence, already at the time of the Buddha's death, of the Five Nikāyas in their present arrangement!</p>
					
					<p>It follows that both on general principles of comparative criticism, and on consideration of a particular instance in this special case, the details given us in the Vinaya about the First Council cannot be trusted. But it does not follow, as a matter of certainty, that there was no Council at all. It is quite possible, and even probable, that the Order held a 'General Chapter,' as we should call it, soon after the Buddha's death. They kept no proper minutes of the meeting. We may conjecture what happened at it, but it would be only conjecture. And we must continue patiently, from the incidental references in the books themselves, to formulate a probable theory as to the method in which the literature gradually sprang up. The record handed down to us in the Vinaya is authentic enough; but only in the only way in which any such record can be considered authentic, that is, as evidence of beliefs held at the date at which it was composed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will strike at these Vajjians,<br />

					I will root out these Vajjians,<br />
					I will destroy these Vajjians,<br />
					I will bring these Vajjians to utter ruin!"</p>

					<p class="f4">2. So he spake to the brahmin Vassakāra<br />
					(the Rain­maker),<br />
					prime-minister of Magadha,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then tell him that Ajātasattu, son of the Vedehī,<br />

					<p class="f4">And bear carefully in mind whatever the Exalted One may predict,<br />

					<p class="f4">For the Buddhas speak nothing untrue!"</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the Rain­maker,<br />

					<p class="f4">And ordering a number of state carriages to be made ready,<br />

					<p class="f4">On arriving there he exchanged with the Exalted One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />

					<p class="f4">Ajātasattu, son of the Vedehī,<br />

					<p class="f4">He says that in his eagerness to attack the Vajjians,<br />

					<p class="f4">18. There too at Nālandā in the Pāvārika mango grove the Exalted One held that comprehen­sive religious talk with the brethren, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such is upright conduct;<br />
					such and such is earnest contemplation;<br />
					such and such is intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great becomes the fruit,<br />
					great the advantage of earnest contemplation,<br />
					when it is set round with upright conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great the advantage of intellect<br />
					when it is set round with earnest contemplation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind set round with intelligence is set quite free from the Intoxications,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Sensuality,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Be <a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> coming,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Delusion,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Ignorance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now when the Exalted One had sojourned as long as he thought fit at Nālandā, he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Ānanda, let us go on to Pāṭaligāma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, lord!' said Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One proceeded, with a great com­pany of the brethren, to Pāṭaligāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Now the disciples at Pāṭaligāma heard of his arrival there,<br />
					and they went on to the place where he was,<br />
					took their seats respectfully beside him,<br />
					and invited him to their village rest-house.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One signified, by silence, his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Then the Pāṭaligāma disciples seeing that he had accepted the invitation,<br />
					rose from their seats,<br />
					and went away to the rest-house,<br />
					bowing to the Exalted One and keeping him on their right as they passed him.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arriving there they strewed all the rest-house with fresh sand,<br />
					placed seats in it,<br />
					set up a water-pot,<br />
					and fixed an oil lamp.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they returned to the Exalted One,<br />
					and saluting him they stood beside him,<br />
					and told him what they had done and said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is time for you to do what you deem most fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">22. And the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					took his bowl and other things,<br />
					went with the brethren to the rest-house,<br />
					washed his feet,<br />
					entered the hall,<br />
					and took his seat against the centre pillar,<br />
					with his face towards the east.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the brethren also,<br />
					after washing their feet,<br />
					entered the hall,<br />
					and took their seats round the Exalted One,<br />
					against the western wall,<br />
					and facing the east.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Pāṭaligāma disciples too,<br />
					after washing their feet,<br />
					entered the hall,<br />
					and took their seats opposite the Exalted One,<br />
					against the eastern wall,<br />
					and facing towards the west.</p>

					<p class="f4">23. Then the Exalted One addressed the Pāṭaligāma disciples, and said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fivefold. 0 householders,<br />
					is the loss of the wrong-doer through his want of rectitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first place the wrong-doer,<br />
					devoid of rectitude, <a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> falls into great poverty through sloth;<br />
					in the next place his evil repute gets noised abroad;<br />
					thirdly, whatever society he enters -<br />
					whether of nobles, brahmins, heads of houses, or men of a religious order -<br />
					he enters shyly and confused;<br />
					fourthly, he is full of anxiety when he dies;<br />
					and lastly, on the dissolution of the body, after death,<br />
					he is reborn into some unhappy state of suffering or woe.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, 0 householders, is the five­fold loss of the evil-doer!</p>

					<p class="f4">24. 'Fivefold, 0 householders, is the gain of the well-doer through his practice of rectitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first place the well-doer, strong in rectitude,<br />
					acquires great wealth through his industry;<br />
					in the next place, good reports of him are spread abroad;<br />
					thirdly, what­ever society he enters -<br />
					whether of nobles, brahmins, heads of houses, or members of a religious order -<br />
					he enters confident and self-possessed;<br />
					fourthly, he dies without anxiety;<br />
					and lastly, on the dissolution of the body, after death,<br />
					he is reborn into some happy state in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, 0 householders, is the fivefold gain of the well-doer.'</p>

					<p class="f4">25. When the Exalted One had thus taught the lay disciples at Pāṭaligāma,<br />
					and incited them, and roused them, and gladdened them,<br />
					far into the night with religious discourse,<br />
					he dismissed them, saying: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">'The night is far spent, 0 householders.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is time for you to do what you deem most fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />
					answered the disciples of Pāṭaligāma,<br />
					and they rose from their seats,<br />
					and bowing to the Exalted One,<br />
					and keeping him on their right hand as they passed him,<br />
					they departed thence.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One, not long after the disciples <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> of Pāṭaligāma had departed thence,<br />
					entered into his private chamber.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">26. At that time Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					were building a fortress at Pāṭaligāma to repel the Vajjians,<br />
					and there were a number of fairies who haunted in thousands the plots of ground there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, wherever ground is so occupied by powerful fairies,<br />
					they bend the hearts of the most powerful kings and ministers to build dwelling-places there,<br />
					wherever ground is so occupied by fairies of middling power,<br />
					they bend the hearts of middling kings and ministers to build dwelling-places there,<br />
					wherever ground is so occupied by fairies of inferior power,<br />
					they bend the hearts of inferior kings and ministers to build dwelling-places there.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">27. And the Blessed One, with great and clear vision,<br />
					surpassing that of ordinary men,<br />
					saw thousands of those fairies haunting Pāṭaligāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he rose up very early in the morning, and said to Ānanda: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who is it then, Ānanda, who is building a fortress at Pāṭaligāma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sunidha and Vassakāra, lord,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					are building a fortress there to keep back the Vajjians.</p>

					<p class="f4">28. 'They act, Ānanda, as if they had consulted with the Tāvatiɱsa angels.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I Ānanda
					with great and clear vision,<br />
					surpassing that of ordinary men,<br />
					see thousands of fairies who haunt plots of ground there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, wherever ground is so occupied by powerful fairies,<br />

					wherever ground is so occupied by fairies of inferior power,<br />
					they bend the hearts of inferior kings and ministers to build dwelling-places there.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as far, Ānanda, as Aryan people resort,<br />
					as far as merchants travel,<br />
					this will become the chief city, Pāṭali-putta,<br />
					a centre for the interchange of all kinds of wares.</p>

					<p class="f4">But three dangers will hang over Pāṭali-putta,<br />
					that of fire,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> 29. Now Sunidha and Vassakāra, the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					proceeded to the place where the Exalted One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they had come there they exchanged with the Exalted One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and stood there respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, so standing, Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					spake thus to the Exalted One: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the venerable Gotama do us the honour of taking his meal,<br />
					together with the company of the brethren,<br />
					at our house to-day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One signified, by silence, his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">30. Then when Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					perceived that he had given his consent,<br />
					they returned to the place where they dwelt.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on arriving there,<br />
					they prepared sweet dishes of boiled rice, and cakes;<br />
					and informed the Exalted One, saymg: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">'The hour of food has come, 0 Gotama,<br />
					and all is ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One robed himself early,<br />
					took his bowl with him,<br />
					and repaired, with the brethren,<br />
					to the dwelling-place of Sunidha and Vassakāra<br />
					and sat down on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And with their own hands they set the sweet rice and the cakes before the brethren with the Buddha at their head,<br />
					and waited on them till they had had enough.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One had finished eating his meal,<br />
					the ministers brought a low seat,<br />
					and sat down respectfully at his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">31. And when they were thus seated the Exalted One gave thanks in these verses: ­</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Wheresoe'er the prudent man shall take up his abode<br />
							<a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a><br /> Let him support the brethren there, good men of self-control,<br />

							Revered, they will revere him: honoured, they honour him again;<br />
							Are gracious to him as a mother to her own, her only son.<br />
							And the man who has the grace of the gods, good fortune he beholds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">32. And when he had thanked the ministers in these verses he rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they followed him as he went, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The gate the Samana Gotama goes out by to-day shall be called Gotama's gate,<br />
					and the ferry at which he crosses the river shall be called Gotarna's ferry.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the gate he went out at was called Gotama's gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">33. But the Exalted One went on to the river.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time the river Ganges was brimful and over­flowing;<br />
					and wishing to cross to the opposite bank,<br />
					some began to seek for boats,<br />
					some for rafts of wood,<br />
					whilst some made rafts of basket-work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br />
					as instantaneously as a strong than would stretch forth his arm,<br />
					or draw it back again when he had stretched it forth,<br />
					vanished from this side of the river,<br />
					and stood on the further bank with the company of the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">34. And the Exalted One beheld the people who wished to cross to the opposite bank looking some of them for boats and some of them for rafts of wood,<br />
					and some of them for rafts of basket-work;<br />
					and as he beheld them he brake forth at that time into this song:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> 'They who have crossed the ocean drear<br />

					<h3 class="ctr"><a id="ch2">Chapter II.</a></h3>

					<p class="f4">1. Now the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Ānanda, let us go on to Koṭigāma'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, lord!' said Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to Koṭigāma;<br />
					and there he stayed in the village itself.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. And at that place the Exalted One addressed the brethren, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is through not understanding and grasping four Aryan Truths, 0 brethren,<br />
					that we have had to run so long,<br />
					to wander so long in this weary path of transmigration,<br />
					both you and I!</p>

					<p class="f4">'And what are these four?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Aryan truth about sorrow;<br />
					the Aryan truth about the cause of sorrow;<br />
					the Aryan truth about the cessation of sorrow;<br />
					and the Aryan truth about the path that leads to that cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when these Aryan truths are grasped and known the craving for future life is rooted out,<br />
					that which leads to renewed becoming is destroyed,<br />
					and then there is no more birth!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">3. Thus spake the Exalted One;<br />
					and when the Happy One had thus spoken,<br />
					then again the Teacher said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'By not seeing the Aryan Truths as they really are,<br />
							Long is the path that is traversed through many a birth:<br />
							<a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> When these are grasped, the cause of rebirth is removed,<br />
							The root of sorrow uprooted, and then there is no more birth.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. There too, while staying at Koṭigāma,<br />
					the Exalted One held that comprehensive religious talk with the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such is upright conduct;<br />
					such and such is earnest contemplation;<br />
					such and such is intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great becomes the fruit,<br />
					great the advantage of earnest contemplation,<br />

					<p class="f4">Great the advantage of intellect<br />
					when it is set round with earnest contemplation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind set round with intelligence is set quite free from the Intoxications,<br />

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now when the Exalted One had remained as long as he thought fit at Koṭigāma,<br />
					he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Ānanda, let us go on to the Nādikas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, lord! ' said Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One proceeded to the Nādikas with a great company of the brethren;<br />

					<p class="f4">10. There, too, at the Brick Hall at Nādika the Exalted One held that comprehensive religious talk with the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such is upright conduct;<br />

					and there at Vesāli the Exalted One stayed at Ambapāli's grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. Now there the Exalted One addressed the brethren, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a brother become mindful?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, 0 mendicants, a brother continues as to the body,<br />
					so to look upon the body that he remains strenuous,<br />

					<p class="f4">13. And how does a brother become self-possessed?</p>

					<p class="f4">He acts, 0 mendicants, in full presence of mind whatever he may do,<br />

					<p class="f4">She went in the carriage as far as the ground was passable for carriages;<br />

					<p class="f4">And when she was thus seated the Exalted One instructed,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then when Ambapāli the courtezan saw that the Exalted One had consented,<br />

					she departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg103"><span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span></a> 15. Now the Licchavis of Vesāli heard that the Exalted One had arrived at Vesāli,<br />
					and was staying at Ambapāli's grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">And ordering a number of state carriages to be made ready,<br />
					they each mounted one of them and went forth with their train from Vesāli.</p>

					<p class="f4">16. And Ambapāli drove up against the young Licchavis,<br />

					and the Licchavis said to Ambapāli the courtezan:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it, Ambapāli, that thou drivest up against us thus?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'My lords, I have just invited the Exalted One and his brethren for their morrow's meal,' said she.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ambapāli! give up this meal to us for a hundred thousand,' said they.</p>

					<p class="f4">'My lords, were you to offer all Vesāli with its subject territory,<br />
					I would not give up so honourable a feast!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Licchavis cast up their hands, exclaiming:</p>

					and they went on to Ambapāli's grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. When the Exalted One saw the Licchavis approaching in the distance,<br />

					the Licchavis alighted there,<br />
					and then went on foot to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and took their seats respectfully by his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they were thus seated the Exalted One instructed and roused and incited and gladdened them with religious discourse.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then they - instructed and roused and incited and gladdened with his words - addressed the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the Exalted One do us the honour of taking his meal,<br />
					together with the brethren,<br />
					at our house to-morrow?'</p>

					<p class="f4">0 Licchavis, I have promised to dine to-morrow with Ambapāli the courtezan,' was the reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Licchavis cast up their hands, exclaiming:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are outdone by this mango girl!<br />

					<p class="f4">And expressing their thanks and approval of the words of the Exalted One,<br />
					they rose from their seats and bowed down before the Exalted One,<br />
					and keeping him on their right hand as they passed him,<br />
					they departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">19. And at the end of the night Ambapāli the courtezan made ready in her mansion sweet rice and cakes,<br />
					and announced the time to the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The hour, lord, has come,<br />
					and the meal is ready!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One who had dressed himself early in the morning,<br />
					took his bowl,<br />
					and his robe,<br />
					and went with the brethren to the place where Ambapāli's mansion was:<br />
					and when he had come there he seated himself on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Ambapāli <a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> the courtezan set the sweet rice and cakes before the Order,<br />

					<p class="f4">And when the Blessed One had quite finished his meal,<br />
					and had cleansed the bowl and his hands,<br />
					the courtezan had a low stool brought,<br />
					and sat down at his side,<br />
					and addressed the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I present this pleasaunce to the order of mendicants,<br />
					of which the Buddha is the chief.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One accepted the gift;<br />
					and after instructing, and rousing, and inciting, and gladdening her with religious discourse,<br />
					he rose from his seat and departed thence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">20. While at Ambapāli's mango grove the Exalted One held that comprehensive religious talk with the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such is upright conduct;<br />

					such and such is intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great becomes the fruit,<br />

					<p class="f4">Great the advantage of intellect<br />

					<p class="f4">The mind set round with intelligence is set quite free from the Intoxications,<br />

					from the Intoxication of Ignorance.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Now when the Exalted One had remained so long as he wished at Ambapāli's grove,<br />
					he addressed Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Ānanda, let us go on to Beluva.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg106"><span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span></a> 'So be it. lord.' said Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One proceeded,<br />
					with a great company of the brethren, to Beluva,<br />
					and there the Exalted One stayed in the village itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">22. Now the Exalted One there addressed the brethren, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 mendicants, do you take up your abode round about Vesāli,<br />
					each according to the place where his friends,<br />
					acquaintances,<br />
					and intimates may live,<br />
					for the retreat in the rainy season<br />
					[for <i>vassa</i>].</p>

					<p class="f4">I shall enter upon the rainy season here at Beluva.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, lord!'<br />
					said those brethren, in assent,<br />
					to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they entered upon the rainy season round about Vesāli,<br />
					each according to the place where his friends, acquaintances, and intimates lived:<br />
					whilst the Exalted One stayed even there at Beluva.</p>

					<p class="f4">23. Now when the Exalted One had thus entered upon the rainy season,<br />
					there fell upon him a dire sickness,<br />
					and sharp pains came upon him,<br />
					even unto death.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One, mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					bore them without complaint.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this thought occurred to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It would not be right for me to pass away without addressing the disciples,<br />
					without taking leave of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me now,<br />
					by a strong effort of the will,<br />
					bend this sickness down again,</p>

					<p class="f4">and keep my hold on life till the allotted time be come.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br />
					by a strong effort of the will,<br />
					bent that sickness down again,<br />
					and kept his hold on life till the time he fixed upon should come.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the sickness abated upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">24. Now very soon after the Blessed One began to recover.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had quite got rid of the sickness,<br />
					he came out from his lodging,<br />
					and sat down in the shadow thereof on a seat spread out there.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> the venerable Ānanda went to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and saluted him,<br />
					and took a seat respectfully on one side,<br />
					and addressed the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have beheld, lord, how the Exalted One was in health,<br />
					and I have beheld how the Exalted One had to suffer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And though at the sight of the sickness of the Exalted One my body became weak as a creeper,<br />
					and the horizon became dim to me,<br />
					and my faculties were no longer clear,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span><br />
					yet notwithstanding I took some little comfort from the thought that the Exalted One would not pass away until at least he had left instructions as touching the Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">25. 'What, then, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does the Order expect that of me?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have preached the truth without making any distinction between exoteric and esoteric doctrine;<br />
					for in respect of the truths, Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata has no such thing as the closed fist of a teacher,<br />
					who keeps some things back.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, Ānanda, should there be any one who harbours the thought,<br />
					"It is I who will lead the brotherhood,"<br />
					or,<br />
					"The Order is dependent upon me,"<br />
					it is he who should lay down instructions in any matter concerning the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Tathāgata, Ānanda,<br />
					thinks not that it is he who should lead the brotherhood,<br />
					or that the Order is dependent upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why then should he leave instructions in any matter concerning the Order?</p>

					<p class="f4">I too, 0 Ānanda, am now grown old,<br />
					and full of years,<br />
					my journey is drawing to its close,<br />
					I have reached my sum of days.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am turning eighty years of age;<br />
					and just as a worn-out cart, Ānanda,<br />
					can be kept going only with the help of thongs,<br />
					so, methinks, the body of the Tathāgata can only be kept going by bandaging it up.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is only, Ānanda when the Tathāgata, by <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> ceasing to attend to any outward thing,<br />
					becomes plunged by the cessation of any separate sensation in that concentration of heart which is concerned with no material object -<br />
					it is only then that the body of the Tathāgata is at ease.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">How delightful a spot, Ānanda, is Vesāli,<br />
					and how charming the Udena Shrine,<br />
					and the Gotamaka Shrine,<br />
					and the Shrine of the Seven Mangoes<br />
					and the Shrine of Many Sons,<br />
					and the Sarandada Shrine,<br />
					and the Chapala Shrine!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, whosoever has developed,<br />
					practised,<br />
					dwelt on,<br />
					expanded and ascended to the very heights of the four paths to <i>Iddhi</i>,<br />
					and so mastered them as to be able to use them as a vehicle,<br />
					and as a basis,<br />
					he, should he desire it,<br />
					could remain in the same birth for an aeon or for that portion of the aeon which has yet to run.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Tathāgata has thoroughly developed,<br />
					practised,<br />
					dwelt on,<br />
					expanded and ascended to the very heights of the four paths to <i>Iddhi</i>,<br />
					and so mastered them as to be able to use them as a vehicle,<br />
					and as a basis,<br />
					and he could, therefore,<br />
					should he desire it,<br />
					live on yet for an aeon,<br />
					or for that portion of the aeon which has yet to run.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But even though a suggestion so evident and a hint so clear were thus given by the Exalted One,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda was incapable of comprehending them;<br />
					and he besought not the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Vouchsafe, lord, to remain during the aeon!</p>

					<p class="f4">Live on through the aeon, 0 Happy One!<br />
					for the good and the happiness of the great multitudes,<br />
					out of pity for the world,<br />
					for the good and the gain and the weal of gods and men!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So far was his heart possessed by the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Then the Exalted One addressed the vener- <a id="pg112"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></a> able Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You may leave me, Ānanda, awhile,<br />
					and do whatsoever now seemeth to thee fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, lord!'<br />
					said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One,<br />
					and passing him on the right sat down at the foot of a certain tree not far off thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Now not long after the venerable Ānanda had been gone,<br />
					Māra, the Evil One, approached the Exalted One and stood beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so standing there,<br />
					he addressed the Exalted One in these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pass away now, lord;<br />
					let the Exalted One now die.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time for the Exalted One to pass away -<br />

					<p class="f4">12. Then the venerable Ānanda went up to the place where the Blessed One was,<br />

					<p class="f4">Without praise and without scorn every word and syllable should be carefully understood and then put beside the Suttas<br />
					and compared with the rules of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">If when so compared they do not harmonize with the Suttas,<br />
					and do not fit in with the rules of the Order,<br />
					then you may come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, this is not the word of the Exalted One,<br />
					and has been wrongly grasped by that brother."</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, brethren, you should reject it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if they harmonize with the Suttas<br />
					and fit in with the rules of the Order,<br />
					then you may come to the conclusion:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, this is the word of the Exalted One,<br />
					and has been well grasped by that brother."</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brethren, you should receive as the fourth Great Authority.</p>

					<p class="f4">'These, brethren, are the Four Great Authorities.'</p>

					<p class="f4">12. There too, the Exalted One held that comprehensive religious talk with the brethren, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such is upright conduct;<br />
					such and such is earnest contemplation;<br />
					such and such is intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great becomes the fruit,<br />
					great the advantage of earnest contemplation,<br />
					when it is set round with upright conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great the advantage of intellect<br />
					when it is set round with earnest contemplation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind set round with intelligence is set quite free from the Intoxications,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Sensuality,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Becoming,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Delusion,<br />
					from the Intoxication of Ignorance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">13. Now when the Exalted One had remained as long as he desired at Bhoga-gama, he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Ānanda, let us go on to Pāvā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg137"><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></a> And there at Pāvā the Exalted One stayed at the Mango Grove of Chunda,<br />
					who was by family a smith.</p>

					<p class="f4">14. Now Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />
					heard that the Exalted One had come to Pāvā,<br />
					and was staying there in his Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Chunda, the worker in metals, went to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and saluting him took his seat respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was thus seated,<br />
					the Exalted One instructed,<br />
					aroused,<br />
					incited,<br />
					and gladdened him with religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Then he, instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened by the religious discourse,<br />
					addressed the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the Exalted One do me the honour of taking his meal together with the brethren,<br />
					at my house to-morrow?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One signified, by silence, his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">16. Then seeing that the Exalted One had consented, Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />
					rose from his seat and bowed down before the Exalted One,<br />
					and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him,<br />
					departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Now at the end of the night, Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />
					made ready in his dwelling-place sweet rice and cakes,<br />
					and a quantity of truffles<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And he <a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> announced the hour to the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The hour, lord, has come,<br />
					and the meal is ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">18. And the Exalted One robed himself early in the morning,<br />
					and taking his bowl,<br />
					went with the brethren to the dwelling-place of Chunda, the worker in metals.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had come thither he seated himself on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated he addressed Chunda, the worker in metals, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to the truffles you have made ready,<br />
					serve me with them, Chunda:<br />
					and as to the other food,<br />
					the sweet rice and cakes,<br />
					serve the brethren with it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">said Chunda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the truffles he had made ready he served to the Exalted One;<br />
					whilst the other food,<br />
					the sweet rice and cakes,<br />
					he served to the members of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now the Exalted One addressed Chunda, the worker in metals, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever truffles, Chunda, are left over to thee,<br />
					those bury in a hole.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see no one, Chunda, on earth nor in Māra's heaven,<br />
					nor in Brahma's heaven,<br />
					no one among Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas,<br />
					among gods, and men,<br />
					by whom, when he has eaten it,<br />
					that food can be properly assimilated,<br />
					save by a Tathāgata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said Chunda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever truffles remained over those he buried in a hole.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went to the place where the Exalted One was;<br />
					and when he had come there,<br />
					took his seat respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated,<br />
					the Exalted One instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened Chunda, the worker in metals<br />
					with religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One then rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Now ṁwhen the Exalted One had eaten the rice prepared by Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />
					there fell upon him a dire sickness,<br />
					the disease of dysentery,<br />
					and sharp pain came upon him,<br />
					even unto death.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One, mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					bore it without complaint.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> And the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come. Ānanda, let us go on to Kusinārā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'When he had eaten Chunda's food,<br />
							The copper-smith's - thus have I heard ­<br />
							He bore with fortitude the pain.<br />
							The sharp pain even unto death!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When he had eaten, from the truffles in the food<br />
							There fell upon the teacher sickness dire.<br />
							Then after nature was relieved the Exalted One announced and said:<br />
							'I now am going on to Kusinārā.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">21. Now the Exalted One went aside from the path to the foot of a certain tree;<br />
					and when he had con1e there he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fold, I pray you, Ānanda, the robe" in four;<br />
					and spread it out for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am weary, Ānanda, and must rest awhile!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One,<br />
					and spread out the robe folded fourfold.</p>

					<p class="f4">22. And the Exalted One seated himself on the seat prepared for him;<br />
					and when he was seated,<br />
					he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					some water.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda, and would drink.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But just now, lord, about five hundred carts have gone over.</p>

					<p class="f4">That water stirred up by the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and turbid.</p>

					<p class="f4">This river Kakuṭṭha, lord,<br />
					not far off,<br />
					is clear and pleasant,<br />
					cool and transparent,<br />
					easy to <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a>  get down into,<br />
					and delightful.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One may both drink the water,<br />
					and cool his limbs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">23. Again the second time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					some water.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda, and would drink.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the second time the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But just now, lord, about five hundred carts have gone over.</p>

					<p class="f4">That water stirred up by the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and turbid.</p>

					<p class="f4">This river Kakuṭṭha, lord,<br />
					not far off,<br />

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One may both drink the water,<br />

					<p class="f4">24. Again the third time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					some water.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda, and would drink.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One:<br />
					and taking a bowl he went down to the streamlet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And lo! the streamlet which,<br />
					stirred up by the wheels,<br />
					was but just now become shallow,<br />
					and was flowing fouled and turbid,<br />
					had begun, when the venerable Ānanda came up to it,<br />
					to flow clear and bright and free from all turbidity.</p>

					<p class="f4">25. Then Ānanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How wonderful, how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tathāgata!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For this streamlet which,<br />
					stirred up by the wheels,<br />
					was but just now become shallow and was flowing foul and turbid,<br />
					now, as I come up to it,<br />
					is flowing clear and bright and free from all turbidity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And taking water in the bowl he returned towards the Exalted One;<br />
					and when he had come where the Exalted One was he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">How wonderful, <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tathāgata!</p>

					<p class="f4">For this streamlet which,<br />
					stirred up by the wheels,<br />
					was but just now become shallow and was flowing foul and turbid,<br />
					now, as I come up to it,<br />
					is flowing clear and bright and free from all turbidity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One drink the water!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Happy One drink the water!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One drank of the water.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">26. Now at that time a man named Pukkusa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					a young Mallian,<br />
					a disciple of Aḷāra Kālāma's, was passing along the high road from Kusinārā to Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					saw the Exalted One seated at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him, he went up to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and when he had come there he saluted the Exalted One,<br />
					and took his rest respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How wonderful a thing it is, lord!<br />
					and how marvellous,<br />
					that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm!</p>

					<p class="f4">27. 'Formerly, lord, Aḷāra Kālāma was once walking along the high road;<br />
					and leaving the road he sat himself down under a certain tree to rest during the heat of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, five hundred carts passed by one after the other,<br />
					each close to Aḷāra Kālāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain man,<br />
					who was following close behind that caravan of carts,<br />
					went up to the place where Aḷāra Kālāma was,<br />
					and when he was come there he spake as follows to Aḷāra Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, did you see those five hundred carts go by?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, indeed, I saw them not."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> '"But, lord, did you hear the sound of them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"No, indeed, sir, I heard not their sound?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, were you then asleep?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"No, sir, I was not asleep?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, were you then conscious?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Even so, sir.?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"So that you, lord, though you were both conscious and awake,<br />
					neither saw,<br />
					nor heard the sound of five hundred carts passing by,<br />
					one after the other,<br />
					and each close to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, lord, even your robe was sprinkled over with the dust of them!"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"It is even so, sir."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then thought that man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How wonderful a thing is it,<br />
					and how marvellous,<br />
					that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm!</p>

					<p class="f4">So much so that a man though being both conscious and awake,<br />
					neither sees,<br />
					nor hears the sound of five hundred carts passing by,<br />
					one after the other,<br />
					and each close to him."</p>

					<p class="f4">'And after giving utterance to his deep faith in Aḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					he departed thence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">28. 'Now what think you, Pukkusa,<br />
					which is the more difficult thing either to do or to meet with -<br />
					that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					should neither see,<br />
					nor hear the sound of five hundred carts passing by,<br />
					one after the other,<br />
					close to him, -<br />
					or that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					should neither see,<br />
					nor hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings are flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts are crashing?'</p>

					<p class="f4">29.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What in comparison, lord,<br />
					can these five hundred carts do,<br />
					or six or seven or eight or nine or ten hundred,<br />
					yea, even hundreds and thousands of carts?</p>

					<p class="f4">That certainly is more difficult,<br />
					both to do and to meet with,<br />
					that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					should neither see,<br />
					nor hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings are flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts are crashing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">30. 'Now on one occasion, Pukkusa,<br />
					I was dwelling <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> at Ātumā,<br />
					and was at the Threshing-floor.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time the falling rain began to beat and to splash,<br />
					and the lightnings to flash forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts to crash;<br />
					and two peasants, brothers,<br />
					and four oxen were killed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Pukkusa,a great multitude of people went forth from Ātumā,<br />
					and went up to the place where the two peasants, brothers,<br />
					and the four oxen, lay killed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">31. 'Now at that time, Pukkusa,<br />
					I had gone forth from the Threshing-floor,<br />
					and was walking up and down thinking at the entrance to the Threshing-floor.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain man came, Pukkusa,<br />
					out of that great multitude of people,<br />
					up to the place where I was;<br />
					and when he came up he saluted me,<br />
					and took his place respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he stood there, Pukkusa,<br />
					I said to the man:</p>

					<p class="f4">32. '"Why then, sir, is this great multitude of people assembled together?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But just now, the falling rain began to beat and to splash,<br />
					and the lightnings to flash forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts to crash;<br />
					and two peasants, brothers, were killed,<br />
					and four oxen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is this great multitude of people gathered together.</p>

					<p class="f4">But where, lord, were you?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, have been here all the while."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, did you see it?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, saw nothing."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But; lord, did you hear it?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, heard nothing."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Were you then, lord, asleep?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, was not asleep."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Were you then conscious, lord?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Even so, sir."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"So that you, lord, being conscious and awake,<br />
					neither saw,<br />
					nor heard the sound thereof when the falling rain went on beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings were flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts were crashing."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"That is so, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">33. 'Then, Pukkusa, the thought occurred to that man:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> '"How wonderful a thing is it,<br />
					and marvellous,<br />
					that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm! -</p>

					<p class="f4">so that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					neither sees,<br />
					nor hears the sound thereof when the falling rain is beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings are flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts are crashing."</p>

					<p class="f4">And after giving utterance to his deep faith in me,<br />
					he departed from me<br />
					[with the customary demonstrations of respect].'</p>

					<p class="f4">34. And when he had thus spoken, Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					addressed the Blessed One in these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now I, lord, as to the faith that I had in Aḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					that I winnow away as in a mighty wind,<br />
					and wash it away as in a swiftly running stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent, lord, are the words of thy mouth,<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal that which is hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br />
					so that those who have eyes can see external forms -<br />
					just even so, lord,<br />
					has the truth been made known to me,<br />
					in many a figure,<br />
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, even I, betake myself, lord,<br />
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Truth,<br />
					and to the Brotherhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as a disciple,<br />
					as a true believer,<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					as long as life endures!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">35. Now Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					addressed a certain man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, my good man,<br />
					a pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, sir!'<br />
					said that man, in assent, to Pukkusa, the young Mallian;<br />
					and he brought a pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> And the Mallian Pukkusa presented the pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear, to the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold is ready for wear.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One show me favour and accept it at my hands!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In that case, Pukkusa, robe me in one,<br />
					and Ānanda in one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said Pukkusa, in assent, to the Exalted One;<br />
					and in one he robed the Exalted One,<br />
					and in one, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">36. Then the Exalted One instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					with religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Pukkusa, the young Mallian,</p>

					<p class="f4">when he had been instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened by the Exalted One with religious discourse,<br />
					arose from his seat,<br />
					and bowed down before the Exalted One;<br />
					and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him,<br />
					departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">37. Now not long after the Mallian Pukkusa had gone,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda placed that pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear,<br />
					on the body of the Exalted One;<br />
					and when it was so placed on the body of the Exalted One<br />
					it appeared to have lost its splendour!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How wonderful a thing is it, lord,<br />
					and how marvellous,<br />
					that the colour of the skin of the Exalted One should <a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> be so clear,<br />
					so exceeding bright!</p>

					<p class="f4">For when I placed even this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold and ready for wear on the body of the Exalted One,<br />
					lo! it seemed as if }t had lost its splendour!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is even so, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two occasions, Ānanda, on which the colour of the skin of a Tathāgata becomes clear and exceeding bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the two?</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the night, Ānanda, on which a Tathāgata attains to the supreme and perfect insight,<br />
					and on the night in which he passes finally away in that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain -<br />
					on these two occasions the colour of the skin of the Tathāgata becomes clear and exceeding bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">38. 'And now this day, Ānanda,<br />
					at the third watch of the night,<br />
					in the Upavattana of Kusinārā,<br />
					in the Sāla Grove of the Mallians,<br />
					between the twin Sāla trees,<br />
					the utter passing away of the Tathāgata will take place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go on to the river Kakutthā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
							All burnished, Pukkusa had brought,<br />
							Clad on with them the Master then<br />
							Shone forth in colour like to gold!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn79" href="#n79">79</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">39. Now the Exalted One with a great company of the brethren went on to the river Kakutthā;<br />
					and when he had come there,<br />
					he went down into the water,<br />
					and bathed,<br />
					and drank.</p>

					<p class="f4">And coming up out agatn on the other side he went on to the Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">42. And the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now it may happen. Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">There has been laid up by Chunda the smith a karma<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One laid himself down on his right side,<br />

					<p class="f4">3. Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are spirits, Ānanda, in the sky,<br />

					leave them,<br />
					sever ourselves from them?</p>

					<p class="f4">How, then, Ānanda, can this be possible ­<br />
					whereas anything whatever born,<br />
					brought into being,<br />
					and organized,<br />
					contains within itself the inherent necessity of dissolution -<br />
					how, then, can this be possible,<br />
					that such a being should not be dissolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">No such condition can exist!</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time, Ānanda, have you been very near to me by acts of love,<br />

					<p class="f4">For a long time, Ānanda, have you been very near to me by thoughts of love,<br />

					<p class="f4">You have done well, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Be earnest in effort,<br />

					[of sensuality, and individuality, and delusion, and ignorance.]!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn95" href="#n95">95</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">15. Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whosoever, brethren, have been Able Awakened Ones through the long ages of the past,<br />
					they also had servitors just as devoted to those Exalted Ones as Ānanda has been to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is a clever man, brethren, is Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now these, brethren, are the four wonderful and marvellous qualities that are in Ānanda.'</p>

					<p class="f4">17. When he had thus spoken, <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn97" href="#n97">97</a>]</sup></span>the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">There there are many wealthy nobles and brahmins and heads of houses,<br />

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Ānanda,<br />

					a branch township.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. 'Long ago, Ānanda, there was a king, by name Mahā-Sudassana,<br />

					a righteous man who ruled in righteousness,<br />
					Lord of the four quarters of the earth,<br />

					the protector of his people,<br />

					<p class="f4">This Kusinārā, Ānanda,<br />
					was the royal city of King Mahā-Sudassana, under the name of Kusāvati,<br />

					<p class="f4">'That royal city Kusāvati, Ānanda, was mighty and prosperous and full of people,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just, Ānanda, as the royal city of the gods, Aḷakamandā by name,<br />

					so <a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> Ānanda, was the royal city Kusāvati mighty and pros­perous,<br />
					full of people,<br />

					<p class="f4">Both by day and by night, Ānanda, the royal city Kusāvati resounded with the ten cries;<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the noise of elephants,<br />
					and the noise of horses,<br />
					and the noise of chariots;<br />
					the sounds of the drum,<br />
					of the tabor,<br />
					and of the lute;<br />
					the sound of singing,<br />
					and the sounds of the cymbal<br />

					and lastly, with the cry:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Eat, drink, and be merry!"'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">19.'Go now, Ānanda, and enter into Kusinārā,<br />

					<p class="f4">"'Even so, lord,' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One;<br />

					<p class="f4">20. Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were assembled in the council hall on some [public] affair:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn101" href="#n101">101</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> And the venerable Ānanda went to the council hall of the Mallas of Kusinārā;<br />

					<p class="f4">21. And when they had heard this saying of the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					the Mallas with their young men and maidens and their wives were grieved,<br />

					and afflicted at heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And some of them wept,<br />
					dishevelling their hair,<br />
					and stretched forth their arms and wept,<br />
					fell prostrate on the ground,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Too soon will the Exalted One die!</p>

					<p class="f4">Too soon will the Happy One pass away!</p>

					<p class="f4">Full soon will the Light of the world vanish away!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Ma11as,<br />
					with their young men and maidens and their wives,<br />
					being grieved,<br />
					and sad,<br />
					and afflicted at heart,<br />
					went to the Sāla Grove of the Mallas,<br />
					to the Upavattana, and to the place where the venerable Ānanda was.</p>

					<p class="f4">22. Then the venerable Ānanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If I allow the Ma11as of Kusinārā,<br />
					one by one,<br />
					to pay their respects to the Exalted One,<br />
					the whole of the Mallas of Kusinārā will not have been presented to the Exalted One until this night brightens up into the dawn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me, now, cause the Mallas of Kusinārā to stand in groups,<br />
					each family in a group,<br />
					and so present them to the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord! a Malla of such and such a name,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda caused the Mallas of <a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> Kusinārā to stand in groups,<br />
					each family in a group,<br />
					and so presented them to the Exalted One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord! a Malia of such and such a name,<br />
					with his children,<br />
					his wives,<br />
					his retinue,<br />
					and his friends,<br />
					humbly bows down at the feet of the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And after this manner the venerable Ānanda presented all the Mallas of Kusinārā to the Exalted One in the first watch of the night.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">23. Now at that time a Wanderer named Subhadda,<br />
					who was not a believer,<br />
					was dwelling at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Wanderer Subhadda heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This very day, they say,<br />
					in the third watch of the night,<br />
					will take place the final passing away of the Samana Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the Wanderer Subhadda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This have I heard from fellow Wanderers old and well stricken in years,<br />
					teachers and disciples,<br />
					when they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sometimes and full seldom do Tathāgatas appear in the world,<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet this day,<br />
					in the last watch of the night,<br />
					the final passing away of the Samana Gotama will take place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain feeling of uncertainty has sprung up in my mind;<br />
					and this faith have I in the Samana Gotama,<br />
					that he, methinks, is able so to present the truth that I may get rid of this feeling of uncertainty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">24. Then the Wanderer Subhadda went to the Sāla Grove of the Mallas,<br />
					to the Upayattana of Kusinārā,<br />
					to the place where the venerable Ānanda was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come there he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus have I heard from fellow Wanderers,<br />
					old and well stricken in years,<br />
					teachers and disciples,<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet this day,<br />
					in the last watch of the night,<br />
					the final passing away of the Samana Gotama will take place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain feeling of uncertainty has sprung up in my mind;<br />

					<p class="f4">0 that I, even I, Ānanda, might be allowed to see the Samana Gotama!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken the venerable Ānanda said to the Wanderer Subhadda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough! friend Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Trouble not the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One is weary.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Wanderer Subhadda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus have I heard from fellow Wanderers,<br />
					old and well stricken in years,<br />
					teachers and disciples,<br />
					when they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sometimes and full seldom do Tathāgatas appear in the world,<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet this day,<br />

					<p class="f4">0 that I, even I, Ānanda, might be allowed to see the Samana Gotama!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Ānanda responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough! friend Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Trouble not the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One is weary.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Wanderer Subhadda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus have I heard from fellow Wanderers,<br />

					<p class="f4">And a third time the venerable Ānanda responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough! friend Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Trouble not the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">25. Now the Exalted One overheard this conversation of the venerable Ānanda with the Wanderer Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One called the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is enough, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not keep out Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Subhadda, Ānanda, may be allowed to see the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever Subhadda may ask of me,<br />
					he will ask from a desire for knowledge,<br />
					and not to annoy me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever I may say in answer to his questions,<br />
					that he will quickly understand.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda said to Subhadda, the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter in, friend Subhadda;<br />
					for the Exalted One gives you leave.'</p>

					<p class="f4">26. Then Subhadda, the Wanderer, went in to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and saluted him courteously,<br />
					and after exchanging with him the compliments of esteem and of civility,<br />
					he took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was thus seated, Subhadda, the Wanderer, said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The leaders in religious life<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn102" href="#n102">102</a>]</sup></span> who are heads of companies of <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> disciples and students,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Enough, Subhadda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let this matter rest whether they,<br />

					<p class="f4">The truth, Subhadda, will I teach you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen well to that,<br />
					and give ear attentively,<br />
					and I will speak!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />
					said the Wanderer Subhadda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">27. And the Exalted One spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> And when he had thus spoken, Subhadda, the Wanderer, said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent, lord, are the words of thy mouth,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down,<br />

					<p class="f4">And I, even I, betake myself, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless in this case I acknowledge the difference in persons.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, lord, whosoever has formerly been a follower of another doctrine,<br />
					and then desires to be received into the higher or the lower grade in this doctrine and discipline, -<br />
					if, in that case, such a person remains on probation for the space of four months;<br />
					and at the end of the four months,<br />
					the brethren, exalted in spirit,<br />
					receive him into the lower or into the higher grade of the Order -<br />
					I too, then, will remain on probation for the space of four months;<br />
					and at the end of the four months let the brethren,<br />
					exalted in spirit,<br />
					receive me into the lower or into the higher grade of the Order!'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One called the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As it is, Ānanda, receive Subhadda into the Order!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so. lord!'<br />
					said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> And Subhadda, the Wanderer, said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					in that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of discipleship in this brotherhood at the hands of the Master himself!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So Subhadda, the Wanderer, was received into the higher grade of the Order under the Exalted One;<br />
					and from immediately after his ordination the venerable Subhadda remained alone and separate,<br />

					<p class="f4">And ere long he attained to that supreme goal of the higher life,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn106" href="#n106">106</a>]</sup></span> for the sake of which the clansmen go out from all and every household gain and comfort to become houseless wanderers -<br />

					and while both the spirits from the skies,<br />
					and the Mallas of Kusinārā upon earth,<br />
					paid honour,<br />

					and respect,<br />
					and homage to the body of the Exalted One,<br />
					with dance,<br />
					and song,<br />

					with garlands,<br />

					they carried the body by the north<br />

					and entering the city by the north gate<br />
					they carried it through the midst of the city<br />
					into the midst thereof;<br />
					and going out again by the eastern gate<br />
					they carried it to the shrine of the Mallas,<br />
					called Makuṭa-bandhana; and there,<br />
					to the east of the city,<br />
					they laid down the body of the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn123" href="#n123">123</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">17<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn124" href="#n124">124</a>]</sup></span> Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What should be done, lord,<br />
					with the remains of the Tathāgata?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As men treat the remains of a king of kings,<br />
					so, Vāseṭṭhas, should they treat the remains of a Tathāgata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, lord, do they treat the remains of a king of kings?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They wrap the body of a king of kings, Vāseṭṭhas,<br />
					in a new cloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that is done<br />
					they wrap it in carded cotton wool.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that is done<br />
					they wrap it in a new cloth,<br />
					and so on till they have wrapped the body in five hundred successive layers of both kinds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they place the body in an oil vessel of iron,<br />
					and cover that close up with another oil vessel of iron.</p>

					<p class="f4">They then build a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumes,<br />
					<a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a>and burn the body of the king of kings.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then at the four cross roads they erect a cairn to the king of kings.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Vāseṭṭhas, is the way in which they treat the remains of a king of kings.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And as they treat the remains of a king of kings,<br />
					so, Ānanda, should they treat the remains of the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the four cross roads a cairn should be erected to the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whosoever shall there place garlands or perfumes or paint,<br />
					or make salutation there,<br />
					or become in its presence calm in heart -<br />
					that shall long be to them for a profit and a joy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">18. Therefore the Mallas gave orders to their attendants, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gather together all the carded cotton wool of the Mallas!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Mallas of Kusinārā wrapped the body of the Exalted One in a new cloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when that was done,<br />
					they wrapped it in carded cotton wool.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when that was done,<br />
					they wrapped it in a new cloth -<br />
					and so on till they had wrapped the body of the Exalted One in five hundred layers of both kinds.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then they placed the body in an oil vessel of iron,<br />
					and covered that close up with another oil vessel of iron.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumes,<br />
					and upon it they placed the body of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now at that time the venerable Mahā Kassapa was journeying along the high road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a great company of the brethren,<br />
					with about five hundred of the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Kassapa left the high road,<br />
					and sat himself down at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just at that time a certain naked ascetic<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn125" href="#n125">125</a>]</sup></span> who had picked up a Mandārava flower in Kusinārā<br />
					was coming along the high road to Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming in the distance;<br />
					and when he had seen him he said to that naked ascetic:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg184"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></a> '0 friend! surely thou knowest our Master?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yea, friend!</p>

					<p class="f4">I know him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This day the Samaṇa Gotama has been dead a week!</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how I obtained this Mandārava flower.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On that of those of the brethren who were not yet free from the passions,<br />
					some stretched out their arms and wept,<br />
					and some fell headlong on the ground,<br />
					and some reeled to and fro in anguish at the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon has the Exalted One died!</p>

					<p class="f4">Too soon has the Happy One passed away!</p>

					<p class="f4">Too soon has the Light gone out in the world!'</p>

					<p class="f4">But those of the brethren who were free from the passions<br />
					[the Arahants]<br />
					bore their grief self-possessed and composed at the thought:-' Impermanent are all component things! How is it possible -<br />
					whereas anything whatever born,<br />
					brought into being,<br />
					and organized,<br />
					contains within itself the inherent necessity of dissolution -<br />
					how then can this be possible that such a being should not be dissolved?'</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Now at that time a brother named Subhadda,<br />
					who had been received into the Order in his old age,<br />
					was seated in that company.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn126" href="#n126">126</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And Subhadda the recruit in his old age<br />
					said to those brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, sirs!</p>

					<p class="f4">Weep not, neither lament!</p>

					<p class="f4">We are well rid of the great <i>Samaṇa.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">We used to be annoyed by being told:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This beseems you,<br />
					this beseems you not."</p>

					<p class="f4">But now we shall be able to do whatever we like;<br />
					and what we do not like,<br />
					that we shall not have to do!'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Mahā Kassapa exhorted the brethren:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, my brethren!</p>

					<p class="f4">Weep not, neither lament!</p>

					<p class="f4">Has not the Exalted One formerly declared this,<br />
					that it is in the very nature of all things near and dear unto us that we must divide ourselves <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> from them,<br />
					leave them,<br />
					sever ourselves frotn them?</p>

					<p class="f4">How then, brethren can this be possible -<br />
					whereas anything whatever born,<br />
					brought into being,<br />
					and organized<br />
					contains within itself the inherent necessity of dissolution -<br />
					how then can this be possible<br />
					that such a being should not be dissolved?</p>

					<p class="f4">No such condition can exist!'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Now just at that time four chieftains of the Mallas had bathed their heads and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pyre of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, behold, they were unable to set it alight!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, lord, can be the reason,<br />
					and what the cause that four chieftains of the Mallas having bathed their heads and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pyre of the Exalted One<br />
					were unable to set it alight?</p>

					<p class="f4">The purpose of the spirits, 0 Vāseṭṭhas, is different.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what, sir. is the purpose of the spirits?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The purpose of the spirits, 0 Vāseṭṭhas, is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">That venerable brother Mahā Kassapa is now journeying along the way from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a great company of the brethren,<br />
					with five hundred brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The funeral pyre of the Exalted One shall not catch fire until the venerable Mahā Kassapa shall have been able reverently to salute the feet of the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even according to the purpose of the spirits so, sir, let it be!'</p>

					<p class="f4">22. Then the venerable Mahā Kassapa went on to Makuṭa-bandhana of Kusinārā, to the shrine of the Mallas,<br />
					to the place where the funeral pyre of the Exalted One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come up to it he arranged his robe on one shoulder;<br />
					and after bowing down with clasped hands,<br />
					he thrice walked reverently round the pyre,<br />
					and then, uncovering the feet,<br />
					he bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those five hundred brethren arranged their robes on one shoulder;<br />
					and bowing down with clasped <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> hands,<br />
					they thrice walked reverently round the pyre,<br />
					and then bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the homage of the venerable Mahā Kassapa and of those five hundred brethren was ended,<br />
					the funeral pyre of the Exalted One caught fire of itself.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn127" href="#n127">127</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">23. Now as the body of the Exalted One burned itself away,<br />
					from the skin and the integument,<br />
					and the flesh,<br />
					and the nerves,<br />
					and the fluid of the joints,<br />
					neither soot nor ash was seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only the bones remained behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as one sees no soot or ash when ghee or oil is burned;<br />
					so, as the body of the Exalted One burned itself away,<br />
					from the skin and the integument,<br />
					and the flesh,<br />
					and the nerves,<br />
					and the fluid of the joints,<br />
					neither soot nor ash was seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only the bones remained behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those five hundred pieces of raiment the very innermost and outermost were both consumed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the body of the Exalted One had been burnt up,<br />
					there came down streams of water from the sky and extinguished the funeral pyre of the Exalted One;<br />
					and there burst forth streams of water from the storehouse of the waters<br />
					[beneath the earth],<br />
					and extinguished the funeral pyre of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Mallas of Kusinārā also brought water scented <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> with all kinds of perfumes,<br />
					and extinguished the funeral pyre of the Exalted One'.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn128" href="#n128">128</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Mallas of Kusinārā surrounded the bones of the Exalted One in their council hall with a lattice Work of spears,<br />
					and with a rampart of bows;<br />
					and there for seven days they paid honour,<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					and respect,<br />
					and homage to them with dance,<br />
					and song,<br />
					and music,<br />
					and with garlands<br />
					and perfumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">24. Now the king of Magadha, Ajātasattu, the son of the queen of the Videha clan,<br />
					heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king of Magadha, Ajātasattu, the son of the queen of the Videha clan,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Sakiyas of Kapilavatthu heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the <a id="pg188"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></a> Sakiyas of Kapilavatthu sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Over the remains of the Exalted One will we put up a sacred cairn,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Bulis of Allakappa heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Bulis of Allakappa sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Koliyas of Rāmagāma heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Koliyas of Rāmagāma sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Over the remains of the Exalted One will we put up a sacred cairn,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the brahmin of Veṭhadīpa heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the brahmin of Veṭhadīpa sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Mallas of Pāvā heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Mallas of Pāvā sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One was a Kshatriya and so are we.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> 25. When they heard these things the Mallas of Kusinārā spoke to the assembled crowds, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One died in our village domain.</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will not give away any part of the remains of the Exalted One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had thus spoken, Doṇa the brahmin addressed the assembled crowds, and said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Hear, gracious sirs, one single word from me.<br />
							Forbearance was our Buddha wont to teach.<br />

							Let us all, sirs, with one accord unite<br />
							In friendly harmony to make eight portions.<br />
							Wide spread let cairns spring up in every land<br />
							That in the Light of the world mankind may trust!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do thou then, 0 brahmin, thyself divide the remains of the Exalted One equally into eight parts,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Be it so, sirs!' said Doṇa the brahmin, in assent, to the assembled brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he divided the remains of the Exalted One equally into eight parts,<br />
					with fair division.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Give me, sirs, this vessel,<br />
					and I will set up over it a sacred cairn,<br />

					<p class="f4">And they gave the vessel to Doṇa the brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">26. And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana heard the news that the Exalted One had died at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Moriyas of Pipphalivana sent a messenger to the Mallas, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One was a Kshatriya and so are we.</p>

					<p class="f4">The remains of the Exalted One are all distributed,'<br />
					then they took away the embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">27. So the king of Magadha, Ajātasattu, the son of the queen of the Videha clan,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus were there eight cairns <i>(Thupas)</i> for the remains,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in2" href="#ifn2">i2</a>]</sup> It does not quite follow that the Vinaya is borrowing direct from the Dīgha. That may be so. But the Subhadda story may have been in existence before either Dīgha or Vinaya was put into its present shape. If so, it was doubtless current in the form now preserved by the Dīgha; and was changed by the compilers of the Vinaya. Both Oldenberg <i>(loc. cit.)</i> and Franke <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1908_vi.pdf">(<i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1908, 8-12)</a> suppose the Vinaya to be borrowing from the Dīgha. It is quite possible that the two books - Dīgha and Vinaya - may have been put together, as we now have them, at the same time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in3" href="#ifn3">i3</a>]</sup> It is admitted there were no reporters present. There were at the time of the Buddha's death no mechanical means available for writing anything beyond the most meagre notes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Ajātasattu Vedehīputto. The first word is not a personal name but an official epithet, 'he against whom there has arisen no (worthy or equal) foe' (so already in the Rig Veda but Sum. I 3I different). The second gives us the maiden family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother. Her name, according to a Tibetan authority quoted by Rockhill, 'Life of the Buddha,' p. 63, was Vāsavī.<br />
					Persons of distinction arc scarcely eyer mentioned by name in Indian Buddhist hooks, a rule applying more especially to kings, but extended not unfrequently to private persons. Thus Upatissa, the disciple whom the Buddha himself declared to be 'the second founder of the kingdom of righteousness,' is referred to either as Dhamma-senāpati or as Sāriputta; epithets of corresponding origin to those in the text. See above, Vol. 1, pp. 193-5.<br />
					By the Jains Ajātasattu is called Kūṇika or Koṇika, which again is probably not the name given to him at the rice-eating (the ceremony corresponding to infant baptism), but a nickname acquired in after-life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Evam mahiddihike evam mahānubhāve.</i> There is nothing magical or supernatural about the <i>iddhi</i> here referred to. <i>Etena tesaɱ samagga-bhāvaɱ kathesi</i> says the commentator simply: thus referring the former adjective to the power of union, as he does the second to the power derived from practice in military tactics <i>(hatthisippādīhi).</i> See above, Vol. I, p. 273.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The wording of §2 is here repeated. [Ed.: included in this version.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Cetiyāni,</i> which Sum. Vil. explains as <i>Yakkha-cetiyāni.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The commentator adds that this was a vihara erected on the site of a former shrine of the Yakkha Sārandada. The teaching referred to is set out in full at A. IV, 16, but the persons taught are there called Licchavis.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> 'Overcome' is literally 'done' <i>(karaṇīya),</i> but the word evidently has a similar sense to that which 'done' occasionally has in colloquial English. <i>Upalāpana,</i> which I have only met with here, must mean 'humbug, cajolery, diplomacy;' see the use of the verb <i>upa-lāpeti,</i> at S. I, 102; Vin. II, I 19; IV, 139; Jāt. II, 266, 267; IV, 56. Sum. Vil. explains it, at some length, as making an alliance, by gifts, with hostile intent, which comes to much the same thing. The root, I think, is <i>lī</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The word translated 'brethren' throughout is in the original <i>bhikkhu,</i> a word most difficult to render adequately by any word which would not, to Christians and in Europe, connote something different from the Buddhist idea. A <i>bhikkhu,</i> literally 'beggar,' was a disciple who had joined Gotama's order; but the word refers to their renunciation of worldly things, rather than to their consequent mendicancy; and they did not really beg in our modern sense of the word. Hardy has 'priests;' I have elsewhere used 'monks' and sometimes 'beggars' and 'members of the order.' This last is, I think, the best rendering; but it is too long for constant repetition, as in this passage, and too complex to be a really good version of <i>bhikkhu.</i> The members of the order were not priests, for they had no priestly powers. They were not monks, for they took no vow of obedience, and could leave the order (and constantly did so and do so still) whenever they chose. They were not beggars, for they had none of the mental and moral qualities associated with that word. 'Brethren' connotes very much the position in which they stood to one another; but I wish there were a better word to use in rendering <i>bhikkhu.</i></p>

							<p>I'll blunder into this one. This is a misunderstanding. Wrong desire is to be eliminated, no question. But the Buddha teaches not only the elimination of wrong desire but also that of any desire whatsoever, including that for attaining Nibbāna. This is explained by the simile of desire to reach a goal. When the goal is attained, the desire is let go. So 'good' desire is both useful and to be abandoned by the seeker, but for the Arahant it is completely abandoned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The blundering misstatement that Buddhism teaches the suppression of desire (not of wrong desire) is still occasionally met with. The question is fully discussed in Mrs. Rhys Davids's article on 'The Will in Buddhism' (<i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1898).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This is an interesting analogue to Philippians iii. I 3: - 'I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark,' etc. See also below, Chap. V, § 68.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The exact distinction between <i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> is here explained by Buddhaghosa as loathing sin as contrasted with fear of sin. But this is rather a gloss than an exact and exclusive definition. <i>Ahirikā</i> is shamelessness, <i>anotappaɱ</i> frowardness. At Jāt. I, 207 we find <i>hiri</i> described as subjective, and <i>ottappa</i> as objective, modesty of heart as contrasted with decency in outward behaviour. See further Mrs. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist Psychology,' p. 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa takes this in a spiritual sense. He says: - 'These virtues are <i>bhujissāni</i> because they bring one to the state of a free man by delivering him from the slavery of craving.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The commentator explains: - 'These virtues are called <i>aparāmaṭṭhāni</i> because they are untarnished by craving or delusion, and because no one can say of him who practises them, "you have been already guilty of such and such a fault." Craving is here the hope of a future life in heaven, and delusion the belief in the efficacy of rites and ceremonies (the two <i>nissayas</i>), which are condemned as unworthy inducements to virtue. At A. III, 132 these five qualities are ca1led <i>phāsu-vihārā,</i> states of bliss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> This paragraph is spoken of as if it were a well-known summary, and it is constantly repeated below. The word I have here rendered 'earnest contemplation' is <i>samādhi,</i> which occupies in the Five Nikāyas very much the same position as faith does in the New Testament; and this section shows that the relative importance of <i>samādhi, paññā,</i> and <i>sīla</i> played a part in early Buddhism just as the distinction between faith, reason, and works did afterwards in Western theology. It would be difficult to find a passage in which the Buddhist view of the relation of these conflicting ideas is stated with greater beauty of thought, or equal succinctness of form. See further Rhys Davids's <i>'The Yogavacara's Manual of Indian Mysticism,'</i> pp. xxv foll., and above, Vol. I, p. 156. Also E. W. West, <i>'Pahlavi Texts,'</i> III, 37; <i>Aŋguttara</i> I, 233; <i>Itivuttaka,</i> No. 59.<br />
					The expression 'set round with' is in Pāli <i>paribhāvita.</i> In a constantly recurring simile (M. I, 104; S. III, 153) eggs are said to be <i>paribhāvitāni</i> by a brooding hen. In medicine the word means 'charged with, impregnated with.' See Jāt. I, 380; IV, 407; and compare Mil. 361, 382, 394. Comp. <i>Bhag. Gītā</i> III 38 for this simile.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Afterwards the seat of the famous Buddhist University for so many centuries the centre of learning in India.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> The following conversation is also given at length in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p28"><i>Sampasadāniya Suttanta</i></a> of the Dīgha Nikāya, and a third time in the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Saɱyutta</i> of the Saɱyutta Nikāya <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm#p12">(S. V, 159)</a>. It was evidently a very popular passage, and is quite possibly the one referred to in Asoka's Bhabra Edict as the 'Question of Upatissa,' that is, of Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Arahant Buddhas. The meaning of these words must have been very present to the minds of those who used them at the time of the rise of what we call Buddhism; and there was little or no difference between the connotation of the two terms. As time went on the two were more and more differentiated, and hardened into technical terms. See Saɱyutta III, 65 on the difference between the two: and see Saɱyutta I, 233; III, 160; IV, 175 for very old explanations of <i>Arahā,</i> and <i>Paṭisambhidā</i> I, 172 for an ancient commentary on the meaning of Buddha.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>RD does not see that Sāriputta said this with the full comprehension that he was not saying 'wisest of all' but 'as wise as all'. And he was speaking only of Buddhas, not of teachers of other views. There is no distinction between Arahantship and Buddhahood in terms of 'freedom of mind.' The distinction between the <i>Sammāsambuddha</i> and the Arahant is that the <i>Sammāsambuddha</i> awakens himself without the help of another whereas the Arahant awakens himself with the aid of the Dhamma taught by the <i>Sammāsambuddha.</i></p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The <i>tertium quid</i> of the comparison is the completeness of the knowledge. Sāriputta acknowledges that he was wrong in jumping to the wide conclusion that his 0wn lord and master was the wisest of all the teachers of the different religious systems that were known to him. So far-after the cross-examination by the Buddha - he admits that his knowledge does not reach. But he maintains that he does know that which is, to him, after all the main thing, namely, that all the Buddhas must have passed through the process here laid down as leading up to the Enlightenment of Arahantship.<br />
					All the details he gives are details, not of Buddhahood, but of Arahantship. He makes no distinction between the two states of attainment. This is most important for the history of that Buddhology, which, in after centuries, was the main factor in the downfall of Buddhism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Four such states are mentioned, <i>apāya, duggati, vinipāto,</i> and <i>nirayo,</i> all of which are temporary states. The first three seem to be synonyms. The last is one of the four divisions into which the first is usually divided, and is often translated hell; but not being an eternal state, and not being dependent or consequent upon any judgement, it cannot be accurately so rendered. See p. 51.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Compare Vinaya III, 93.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> The curious popular belief as to good and bad fairies haunting the sites of houses gave rise to a quack science, akin to astrology, called <i>vatthu-vijjā,</i> which Buddhaghosa explains here at some length, and which is frequently condemned elsewhere in the Five Nikāyas. See, for instance, I of the <i>Mahā-sīlam,</i> translated above, Vol. I, p. 18. The belief is turned to ridicule in the edifying legend, No. 40, in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 326-34.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> This paragraph is of importance to the orthodox Buddhist as proving the Buddha's power of prophecy and the authority of the Buddhist scriptures. To those who conclude that such a passage must have been written after the event that is prophesied (if any), it may be valuable evidence of the age both of the Vinaya and of this <i>Mahā Parinibbāna Suttanta</i>. See the note at 'Vinaya Texts,' II. 102.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Tāsaɱ dakkhiṇaɱ ādise.</i> See Therī Gāthā 307, 311; Mil. 294.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> That is, those who cross the 'ocean drear' of <i>taṇhā,</i> or craving; avoiding by means of the 'dyke' or causeway of the Aryan Path, the 'pools' or shallows of lust, and ignorance, and delusion (comp. Dhp. 91), whilst the vain world looks for salvation from rites, and ceremonies, and gods, -' these are the wise, these are the saved indeed!'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> As will be observed from the similar passages that follow, there is a regular sequence of clauses in the set descriptions of the Buddha's movements. The last clause should specify the particular grove or house where the Exalted One stayed; but it is also (in this and one or two other cases) inserted with due regularity even when it adds nothing positive to the sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Compare below, <a href="#ch4">Chapter IV,</a> §§ 2, 3; p. 131.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> At first Nādika is (twice) spoken of in the plural number (a clan name); but then, thirdly, in the last clause, in the singular (a local name derived from the clan-name). Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that there were two villages of the same name on the shore of the same piece of water. The 'Brick Hall' was the public resting­place for travellers, and the name is noteworthy as almost all buildings were then of wood.<br />
					The expression used here is an idiomatic phrase descriptive of the arrival of travellers at a place: - 'and there, at X. so and so stayed in Y.' where X. is the name of the town or village, and Y. is the lodging­place the traveller occupies. (See just above in § 1 for a good instance.) The first name, the name X., is always the name of the town, and never an adjective in agreement with the second name. It seems simple enough; but even the best Sanskritists appear sometimes to be unfamiliar with the force of this Pāli idiom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> See Rhys Davids's 'Buddhism,' pp. 108-10; above, Vol. I, pp. 190-2; below, at VI. 6, and in the translation of D. II, 201; also Divyāvadāna, pp. 533-4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> This doctrine of being 'mindful and self-possessed' is one of the lessons most frequently inculcated in the Pāli Piṭakas, and is one of the 'Seven Jewels of the Law.' It is fully treated of in each of the Nikāyas, forming the subject of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">Mahā Satippaṭṭhāna Suttanta</a> in the Dīgha Nikāya, and the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">Satippaṭṭhāna Suttanta</a> of the Majjhima Nikāya, and the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm">Satippaṭṭhāna Saɱyutta</a> of the Saɱyutta Nikāya, as well as of various passages in the Aŋguttara Nikāya, and of the Vibhaŋga. See above, Vol. I, pp. 80, 81; and the translation, below, of pp. 290 foll. of the text. The point is there discussed in detail.<br />
					Buddhaghosa has no comment here on the subject itself, reserving what he has to say for the comment on the Suttantas devoted entirely to it; but he observes in passing that the reason why the Exalted One laid stress, at this particular time and place, on the necessity of being 'mindful and thoughtful,' was because of the imminent approach of the beautiful courtezan in whose grove they were staying. The use of the phrase <i>sati upaṭṭhāpetabbā</i> below, Chap. V, 9 (text, p. 141), in reference to the way in which women should be treated, is quite in accordance with this explanation. But see the next note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> From this point down to the words 'he rose from his seat,' in II, 24 is, with a few unimportant variations, word for word the same as Vinaya, Vol. I, pp. 231-3. But the passage there follows immediately after the verses translated above, I. 34, so that the events here (in §§ 14-18) localized at Vesāli, are there localized at Koṭigāma. Our section II, 5 is then inserted between our sections II, 18 and II, 19; and our section II, I 11 does not occur at all, the Exalted One only reaching Ambapāli's grove when he goes there (as in our section II, 19) to partake of the meal to which he had been invited. Buddha­ghosa passes over this apparent discrepancy in silence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Literally 'by this woman.' But I have tried to reproduce the evident word-play. Ambapāli means mango grower, one who looks after mangoes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The Tāvatiɱsa-devā are the gods in the heaven of the Great Thirty-Three, the principal deities of the Vedic Pantheon. See A. III, 239; Sum. I, 310; Mahāvastu I, 262.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> The Malālaŋkāra-vatthu gives the substance of the discourse on this occasion. 'The princes had come in their finest and richest dress; in their appearance they vied in beauty with the nats (or angels). But foreseeing the ruin and misery that was soon to come upon them all, the Buddha exhorted his disciples to entertain a thorough contempt for things that are dazzling to the eyes, but essentially perishable and unreal in their nature.' - Bigandet, 2nd ed., p. 260.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Bishop Bigandet says: 'In recording the conversion of a courtezan named Apapalika, her liberality and gifts to Budha and his disciples, and the preference designedly given to her over princes and nobles, who, humanly speaking, seemed in every respect better entitled to attentions - one is almost reminded of the conversion of 'a woman that was a sinner,' mentioned in the Gospels ('Legend of the Burmese Budha,' 2nd ed., p. 258).The Vinaya (I, Z3.J) says they went to the Great Wood near</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> The Vinaya (I, 233) says they went to the Great Wood near Vesāli, that is, it skips the context here as far as III, 64. Our sections 27-35 are in the Saɱyutta V. 152-4.</p>

The Sumangala Vilāsinī agrees, but in such a way as to throw no light on the derivation of the word. In the Saɱyutta Nikāya  (V, 153) the Burmese Phayre MS. reads <i>vekhamissakena</i> and another Burmese MS. <i>vedha</i> - but SS. all read <i>vegha.</i> The Siamese edition has <i>veḷu.</i> My Dīgha Nikāya confirms Childers's reading, which no doubt correctly represents the uniform tradition of the Ceylon MSS. On the use of the word <i>missaka</i> at the end of a compound see Jātaka II, 8, 420, 433; and compare M. I, 82; Thera-gāthā 1.4-3; Mil.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says:- '<i>Tamatagge</i> is for <i>tamagge.</i> The "t" in the middle is used for euphony. This word means, "These are the most pre-eminent, the very chief." Having, as above stated, broken every bond of darkness <i>(tama),</i> those bhikkhus of mine, Ānanda, will be at the very top, in the highest condition. They will be at the very top of whom? Those bhikkhus who are willing to learn, and those who exercise themselves in the four ways of being mindful and thoughtful, they shall be at the top of all (the rest). Thus does he make Arahantship the three-peaked height of his discourse' (compare on this last phrase <i>Nibbānena desanākutam gaṇhāti,</i> Jātaka I, 275, 393, 401; and see also I, 114). <i>Uttama,</i> the highest (scil. <i>bhava,</i> condition ), is used absolutely of Arahantship or Nirvana at Jātaka I, 96; <i>Aggaphala</i> occurs in the same sense at Jātaka I, 114; and even Phalagga at Mahāvaɱsa XV, 209. The last words, 'but they must be anxious to learn,' seem to me to be an afterthought. It is only those who are thoroughly determined to work out their own salvation, without looking for safety to any one else, even to the Buddha himself, who will, whilst in the world, enter into and experience Nirvana. But, of course, let there be no mistake, merely to reject the vain baubles of the current superstitious beliefs is not enough. There is plenty to learn and to acquire, of which enough discourse is elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> <i>Iddhi.</i> The four paths are: - (1) will, ( 2) effort, (3) thought, and (4) investigation, each united to earnest thought and the struggle against evil. On the <i>Iddhi</i> to be reached by them see above, Vol. I, pp. 272, 273; and the translator's <i>'Buddhism,'</i> pp. 174-7. The whole set of participles is used elsewhere of other conditions of mind. So, for instance, of universal love <i>(mettā)</i> at A. V, 342, quoted Jātaka II, 61 , Mil. 198. An ancient commentary on them is preserved at <i>Paṭis.</i> I, 172.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> <i>Yathā tam Mārena pariyuṭṭhitacitto.</i> Here <i>tam</i> is the indeclinable particle, <i>yathā taɱ</i> introducing an explanation. My MS. of the <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i> and the Turnour MS. of the Sumangala Vilāsinī read <i>parivuṭṭhita,</i> and either spelling is correct. The fact is that the 'y' or 'v' in such cases is even less than euphonic; it is an assistance not to the speaker, but merely to the writer. Thus in the Sinhalese <i>duwanawā,</i> 'to run,' the spoken word is <i>duanawā,</i> and the 'w' is written only to avoid the awkward use in the middle of a written word of the initial sign for the sound 'a'. That the speakers of Pili found no difficulty in pronouncing two vowels together is abundantly proved by numerous instances. The writers of Pāli, in those cases in which the second vowel begins a word, use without hesitation the initial sign; but in the middle of the word this would be so ungainly that they naturally prefer to insert a consonantal sign to <i>to carry the vowel sign.</i> The varying readings I have pointed out are a strong confirmation of the correctness of the pronunciation of modern native scholars (in this case <i>pari-uṭṭhita</i>); and we may the more readily adopt it as the question is not really one concerning the pronunciation of <i>Pāli,</i> but concerning the use which modern native copyists make of their own alphabet. I would pronounce therefore <i>pari-utthita-citto.</i> See Windisch, <i>'Māara und Buddha,'</i> p. 40; M. I, 433-4; Vin. II, 289; IV: 94, 229.</p>

							<p>This sutta is in answer to no such thing. This is a viewpoint dependent on RD's own views. The doctrine would have been understood: The Body is not the Self of the Buddha. To prolong it's life beyond it's natural life-span would need to be done with an act which could only be done by way of desire or compassion. On his own the Buddha would let the body die naturally, it would take a request such as suggested to Ānanda for him to so work things that the body would live on past it's natural lifespan.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> The narrative is now interrupted by the insertion of paragraphs which at first sight seem to be quite out of place. But the connexion, or want of connexion, between them and the main story is very suggestive as to the way in which the Suttanta was put together. The whole chapter is an answer to a possible objection, either from out­siders or from weaker members of the fold, that if the Buddha were really so great why did he die at all. The suggested answer is that he could have lived on if he had so wished; but he did not wish because he had certain kinds of power and insight and self-mastery which prevented him from doing so. For the purpose of this answer these paragraphs, already in existence among the Suttas current in the community, and dealing with these powers, are here repeated without any such connecting argument as we should find under similar circumstances, in a modern (written) book of apologetics. The argument suggested by them follows exactly the same lines as that in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p6">Mahāli Suttanta,</a> translated in the former volume (Number VI of the 'Dialogues').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> <i>Devatā</i> is a fairy, god, genius, or angel. I am at a loss how to render this word without conveying an erroneous impression to those not familiar with ancient ideas, and specially with ancient Indian ideas, of the spirit world. It includes gods of all sorts; tree and river nymphs; the kindly fairies or ghosts who haunt houses (see my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' Tale 40); spirits in the ground (see above, I, 26); the angels who minister at the great renunciation, the temptation, and the death of the Buddha; the guardian angels who watch over men, and towns, and countries; and many other similar beings. 'Celestial beings' would be wholly inapplicable, for instance, to the creatures referred to in the curious passage above (I, 26). 'Super­human being' would be an inaccurate rendering; for all these light and airy shapes come below, and after, man in the Buddhist order of precedence. 'Spirit' being used of the soul inside the human body, and of the human soul after it has left the body, and figuratively of mental faculties - none of which are included under <i>devatā</i> - would suggest ideas inconsistent with that of the Pāli word. As there is therefore no appropriate general word I have chosen, for each passage where the expression occurs, the word used in English of the special class more particularly referred to in the passage of the text. Here all kinds of <i>devatās</i> being referred to, and there being no word in English for them all, I have ventured to put the word <i>devatā</i> into my version, and to trouble the reader with this note.</p>

							<p>Matthew 21 18-22: <i>"Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever." And presently the fig tree withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, "How soon is the fig tree withered away!" Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, 'Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea'; it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."</i><br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa here tells a long story how Saŋgharakkhita Sāmaṇera, the nephew of Nāga Thera, attained Arahantship on the day of his admission to the order; and at once proceeded to heaven, and standing on the pinnacle of the palace of the king of the gods, shook the whole place with his big toe; to the great consternation and annoyance of the exalted dwellers therein! There is no doubt a real truth in the idea that deep thought can shake the universe, and make the palaces of the gods to tremble, just as faith is said in Matthew xxi. 21 to be able to remove mountains, and cause them to be cast into the sea. But these figurative expressions have, in Buddhism, become a fruitful soil for the outgrowth of superstitions and misunderstandings. The train of early Buddhist speculation in this field has yet to be elucidated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> The Bodhisatta's voluntary incarnation is looked upon by the Buddhists as a great act of renunciation, and curious legends have gathered about it. One is that on the night when she conceived his mother dreamt that a white elephant entered her side. The account will be found at length in my 'Buddhist Birth Stories' (pp. 62-4), and the earthquake is there mentioned in terms identical with those in the text. As I have pointed out in 'Buddhism' (p. 184), the white elephant legend is one of those hallowed sun stories by which half­converted Indians strove to embellish the life-story of the Teacher whose followers they had become. In the Lalita Vistara (Calc. ed. p. 63) the entrance of the elephant into Māyā precedes the dream; but though the ignorant may have therefore accepted it as a fact, it is of course only a figure of speech - and I venture to think from the Indian standpoint, a beautiful figure of speech - to express the incarnation of divine mildness and majesty in a human form. The use of such a figure is not confined to India. In one of the Apocryphal Gospels, the Gospel according to the Hebrews, the incarnation of the divine gentleness and love is expressed by saying that a dove from heaven 'entered into' the human form.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Windisch, <i>'Māra und Buddha,'</i> p. 75, makes this number refer to the number of entrances, and quotes Itivuttaka, p. 15, in support. The Singhalese version (p. 758) is as above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> This and the next paragraph are based upon the Buddhist belief as to the long-vexed question between the Indian schools who represented more or less closely the European Idealists and Realists. When cleared of the many repetitions inserted for the benefit of the repeaters or reciters, the fundamental idea seems to be that the great necessity is to get rid of the delusion that what one sees and feels is real and permanent. Nothing is real and permanent but character.<br />
					The so-called eight Positions of Mastery are merely an expansion of the first two of the following eight Stages of Deliverance, and the whole argument is also expressed in another form in the passage on the nine successive 'Cessations,' of which an abstract will be found in Childers, <i>sub voce nirodha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> I do not understand the connexion of ideas between this paragraph and the idea repeated with such tedious iteration in the preceding paragraphs. The two seem to be in marked contrast, if not in absolute contradiction. Perhaps we have here the older tradition; and certainly this paragraph is more in accordance with the general impression of the character, and with the other sayings, of Gotama as handed down in the Pāli Piṭakas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> <i>Dhamma</i> and <i>vinaya.</i> The Buddhist religion, as just summarized, and the regulations of the Order.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> It is of great interest to notice what are the points upon which Gotama, in this last address to his disciples, and at the solemn time, when death was so near at hand, is reported to have lain such emphatic stress. Unfortunately we have only a fragment of the address, and, as it would seem from its commencement, only the closing fragment. This, however, is in the form of a summary, consisting of an enumeration of certain aggregates, the details of which must have been as familiar to the early Buddhists as the details of similar numerical terms-such as the ten commandments, the twelve tribes, the seven deadly sins, the four gospels, and so on - afterwards were to the Christians. This summary of the Buddha's last address may fairly be taken as a summary of Buddhism, which thus appears to be simply a system of earnest self-culture and self-control.<br />
					The following are the details of the aggregate technical terms used in the above summary, but it will be understood that the English equivalents used give rather a general than an exact representation of the ideas expressed by the Pāli ones. To attempt more would demand a treatise rather than a note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The four Earnest Meditations are:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. Meditation on the body.<br />
					2. Meditation on the sensations.<br />
					3. Meditation on the ideas.<br />
					4. Meditation on reason and character.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The. fourfold Great Struggle against evil is divided into:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. The struggle to prevent evil arising.<br />
					2. The struggle to put away evil states which have arisen.<br />
					3. The struggle to produce goodness not previously existing.<br />
					4. The struggle to increase goodness when it does exist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The four Roads to Saintship are four means by which <i>Iddhi</i> (see above, § 3, note) is to be acquired. They are:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. The will to acquire it united to earnest meditation and the struggle against evil.<br />
					2. The necessary exertion united to earnest meditation and the struggle against evil.<br />
					3. The necessary preparation of the heart united to earnest medita­tion and the struggle against evil.<br />
					4. Investigation united to earnest meditation and the struggle against evil.</p>

							<p>The difference between th <i>balāni</i> and the <i>indriyāni</i> is that the former is subjective power as perceived and used by the individual where the latter are objective forces.

					<p class="lgqt">The five moral powers (<i>balāni</i>) are said to be the same as the next class, called organs (<i>indriyāni</i>). It is no doubt most remarkable that, in a summary like this, two classes out of seven should be absolutely identical except in name. The difference of name is altogether too unimportant to account, by itself, for the distinction made. Either the currently accepted explanation of one of the two aggregate terms must be incorrect, or we must look for some explanation of the repetition other than the mere desire to record the double title. Is it impossible that the one class was split into two to bring the number of the classes up to the sacred number seven, corresponding to the seven Ratanas of a Cakkavatti?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The details of both classes are:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. Faith.<br />

The problem is with #s 5 and 7 in that list, which should be 'impassivity' and 'detachment' respectively, so that in that list there is a progressive sequence: impassivity, serenity, detachment and in 'the Eightfold Path' the sequence goes from effort, setting up the mind, serenity.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> This is merely a stock phrase for introducing verses which repeat the idea of the preceding phrase (see above, paragraph 32). It is an instructive sign of the state of mind in which such records are put together, that these verses could be ascribed to Gotama himself with­out any feeling of the incongruity involved.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> The last word, <i>Parinibbuto,</i> was misunderstood by Childers. It is used in the Nikāyas of living persons in the sense of set free (from evil), at peace. In one passage (M. I, 446) it is even used of a living horse. In all of these passages Childers's rendering 'extinguished, extinct, dead' would be quite inexplicable. Such passages are Majjhima I, 45, 235, 251; II, 102; Thera-gāthā 5, 7, 8, 9, etc.; Sutta Nipāta 359, 758; Saɱyutta III, 26, 54; Itivuttaka 52, 56; Dhammapada 89. The same usage is still found in later books (Milinda 50; Jātaka IV, 303, 453). But, just as in the somewhat analogous Christian expression <i>entered into rest,</i> the word (still in its ordinary meaning as above) is once or twice used, figuratively, of Arahants who have died. They are at peace, set free. There is no word in the Buddhist phrase corresponding to the Christian 'entered.' The Buddhists never say <i>entered into Nirvana</i> of a deceased person. So far as I know the phrase occurs only once (Sutta Nipāta 514), and then it is used of a living person.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> The meaning of <i>mahāpadesa</i> is not quite clear. Perhaps it should be rendered 'true authorities.' I have followed Buddhaghosa in taking <i>apadesa</i> as the last part of the compound. He says: - <i>mahāpadesā ti mahā-okāse mahā-apadese vā. Buddhādayo mahante mahante apadisitva vuttāni mahākaranāni ti attho,</i> 'the causes (authorities) alleged when referring to Buddha and other great men.' Mr. Samarasekara takes it as <i>mahā-padesa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> I ought perhaps to have explained why I have ventured to differ from Childers in the rendering of the common word <i>patisunāti.</i> The root <i>&#347;ru</i> seems to have meant 'to sound' before it meant 'to hear'; and, whether this be so or not, <i>pati-sunāti</i> means not simply 'to consent,' but 'to answer (assentingly).' It has been pointed out to me that answer was formerly <i>andswerian</i> where <i>swerian</i> is probably not unrelated to the root <i>svar,</i> 'to sound.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> <i>Sutte otāretabbāni vinaye sandassetabbāni,</i> where one would expect to find the word <i>Piṭaka</i> if it had been in use when this passage was first written or composed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> <i>Sūkara-maddava.</i> See the note in my translation of the Milinda (1890), Vol. I, p. 244. Dr. Hoey informs me that the peasantry in these districts are still very fond of a bulbous root, a sort of truffle, found in the jungle, and called <i>sūkara-kanda.</i> Mr. K. E. Neumann, in his translation of the Majjhima (1896), p. xx, has collected several similar instances of truffle-like roots, or edible plants, having such names. The Sinhalese translation of the Dīgha (London and Colombo, 1905), p. 796, simply repeats the Pāli word. Buddhists do not attach much importance to the point. They have been mostly vegetarians, and are increasingly so. But their scheme of ethics works from within; and the Buddha expressly refused, in the case of Devadatta's schism, to lay down any hard and fast rule as to abstinence from flesh as food. It is perhaps of importance that the food prepared by Chunda and eaten by the Buddha is called Bhatta (below, § 21): this is not used elsewhere of meat.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> 'It should be understood,' says Buddhaghosa, 'that these are verses by the Theras who held the council.' And he repeats this at §§ 38, 41. These here seem to be two different versifications of the same legend.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> This is a most unusual way of speaking of the Buddha. In the Suttantas believers are represented as addressing him as <i>bhante,</i> lord or sir (the same form as that used by junior members of the Order in addressing their seniors); and as speaking of him by the epithet Bhagavā the Exalted One. Unbelievers address him as <i>bho Gotama</i>, and speak of him as the Samaṇa Gotama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> The Pukkusas were one of the despised tribes. Compare M. II, 152; A. II, 85; PP. IV, 19; Jāt. IV, 205, 306; Lalita Vistara XXI, 17. But Buddhaghosa says Pukkusa must here be simply a name, as the Mallas were Khattiyas. He adds that this Pukkusa was the owner of the five hundred carts that had just passed by; and that Aḷāra Kālāma was called Aḷāra because he was Dīgha-pingalo, Kālāma being his family name.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> This is a stock phrase constituting the final answer of a hitherto unconverted man at the end of one of those argumentative dialogues by which Gotama overcame opposition or expounded the truth. After a discussion of exalted themes it fits in very appropriately; here and elsewhere it is incongruous and strained. See below, V, 50.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> To understand what is here represented to have happened one must understand the mode in which the Buddhist Wanderers wore their robes. There was no tailoring at all. The set of three robes was simply three lengths of cotton cloth about a yard wide. One piece, folded in half, was wrapped round the body. Another piece covered the limbs from the waist to the ankles. It was supported by a girdle and went three or four times round. The third piece was put on over this last, went twice round the legs) and then the rest of it was thrown over the left shoulder, and passed under the right arm across the body. See below, ch. V, § 19.<br />
					Pukkusa had placed the two lengths of cloth, shawl-wise, over the shoulders of the recipients. When he left them Ānanda assisted the Buddha to put them on as Nos. 1 and 3 of a set of robes.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> We have here the commencement of the legend which afterwards grew into an account of an actual 'transfiguration' of the Buddha. It is very curious that it should have taken place soon after the Buddha had announced to Ānanda his approaching death, and that in the Buddhist Sutta it should be connected so closely with that event; for a similar remark applies also to the Transfiguration mentioned in the Gospels.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> Here, and above pp. 137-9, we have spelt the name of the smith, in English, as it is pronounced in Pāli, and should be pronounced in English.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> According to the commentator 'tradition says that there was a row of Sāla trees at the head <i>(sīsa)</i> of that couch, and another at its foot, one young Sāla tree being close to its head, and another close to its foot. The twin Sāla trees were so called because the two trees were equally grown in respect of the roots, trunks, branches, and leaves. There was a couch there in the park for the special use of the (periodically elected) chieftin of the Mallas, and it was this couch which the Exalted One asked Ānanda to make ready.'<br />
					There is no further explanation of the term <i>uttara-sīsakaɱ,</i> which may have been the name for a slab of wood or stone reserved on great occasions for the use of the leaders of the neighbouring republic, but available at other times for passers-by.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> We have here the unusual case of the Buddha being called Tathāgata, not by himself, but by a third person, the compiler of the Suttanta. The paragraph is perhaps moulded by inadvertence on the next one. But see § 10. Compare the note above on IV, 25.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains that even twenty to sixty angels or gods <i>(devatāyo)</i> could stand <i>āragga-koṭi-nittūdana-</i> (MS. <i>nittaddana-</i>) <i>matte pi,</i> 'on a point pricked by the extreme point of a gimlet,' without inconveniencing one another <i>(aññam aññam avyābādhenti).</i> It is most curious to find this exact analogy to the notorious discussion as to how many angels could stand on the point of a needle in a commentary written at just that period of Buddhist history which corresponds to the Middle Ages of Christendom. The passage in the text does not really imply or suggest any such doctrine, though the whole episode is so absurd that the author of the text could not have hesitated to say so, had such an idea been the common belief of the early Buddhists. With these sections should be compared the similar sections in Chapter VI, of which these are perhaps merely an echo.<br />
					There is no comment on <i>nittūdana</i>, but there can be little doubt that Childers's conjectural reading is correct.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> It is literally, 'the Eye in the world will vanish away,' where Eye is of course used figuratively of that by the aid of which spiritual truths can be perceived, corresponding exactly to the similar use in Europe of the word Light. The Master is often called 'He with the Eye,' 'He of the Spiritual Eye' (see, for instance, the last verses in this Book), and here by a bold figure of speech he is called the Eye itself, which was shortly about to vanish away from the world, the means of spiritual insight which was no longer to be available for the common use of all men. But this is, it will be noticed, only the lament of the foolish and ignorant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> The words in brackets have been inserted from par. III, 48 above. See par. VI, 19 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> This conversation occurs also below (VI, 17), and the older tradition probably had it only in that connexion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> King of kings is an adequate rendering of the 'King of the Rolling Wheel,' the wheels of whose chariot roll unhindered through the land; that is to say, a king whose power no other king can dispute, who is an acknowledged overlord. The idea, which is explained very fully in the next Suttanta, may have arisen with the rise of the Kosala power; but it may also be later. If we could trace its history it would afford us a guide to the date at which the Mahā Parinibbāna Suttanta assumed its present form.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains this passage thus: - 'As Benares cloth, by reason of its fineness of texture, does not take the oil, he therefore says: - "with <i>vihata</i> cotton wool," that is, with cotton wool that has been well forced asunder.' The technical use of the word, as applied to cotton wool, has only been found in this passage. It usually means 'torn' with grief.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> <i>Ayasāya tela-doṇiyā</i>, where one would expect <i>āyasāya,</i> but my MS. of the Dīgha Nikāya confirms twice over here, and twice again below (VI, 33, 35) the reading given by Childers. Buddhaghosa says the word here means gold. <i>Ayas</i> was originally used for bronze, and only later for iron also, and at last exclusively of iron. As <i>kaɱsa</i> is already a common word for bronze in very early Buddhist Pāli texts. I think <i>āyasa</i> (not <i>ayasa</i>) would here mean 'of iron.' When Buddha­ghosa says it is here a name for gold, we can only conclude that iron had become, in his time, a metal which he might fairly consider too base for the purpose proposed. The whole process as described is not very intelligible; and one might suppose that <i>ayasa</i> after all had nothing to do with any metal, and was a technical term descriptive of some particular size or shape or colour of oil vessel. But it is frequently found in the MSS. when iron is clearly meant. Thus in the popular verse at Saɱyutta 1, 77 on which a Jātaka is based (II, 140), which is inserted in the 'Anthologies' (Dhammapada 345, Khar. MS. No. 102), and twice quoted in the Netti (35, 153), the MSS. have both forms in spite of the metre favouring the long vowel. In this passage both Paññānanda's Colombo edition of 1877, and Samarasekara's version (Col. and Lond. 1905) have the short vowel only.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> <i>Thūpa.</i> A solid mound or tumulus or barrow, in the midst of which the bones and ashes are to be placed. The dome of St. Paul's as seen from the Thames Embankment gives a very good idea of one of the later of these Buddhist monumental mounds.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> <i>Pacceka-buddho.</i> One who has attained to the supreme and perfect insight; but dies without proclaiming the truth to the world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> The expression that Ānanda went 'into the Vihara' at the end of a conversation represented as having taken place in the Sāla Grove, would seem to point to the fact that this episode originally stood in some other connexion. Buddhaghosa attempts to explain away the discrepancy by saying that Vihara here means <i>Maṇḍala</i>. As the spot was the place for the performance of the communal ceremonies of the clan there was most likely a <i>Maṇḍala</i> there, and there must, from the context below, § 25), have been also some small closed-in building, a hut or cottage. It is only this latter that could have been called a Vihāra.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> Ānanda had entered the Noble Path, but had not yet reached the end of it. He had not attained to Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> <i>Advayena,</i> which Buddhaghosa explains as not being that kind of love which is now one thing and now another, or which varies in the presence or the absence of the object loved.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> That is, you too shall become an Arahant, shall attain Nirvana in this life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> A word has here slipped out of the text, <i>medhāvī</i> should stand before <i>jānāti</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> From here down to the end of section 18 is found also, nearly word for word, in the beginning of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p17">Mahā-Sudassana Suttanta,</a> translated below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> <i>Kuḍḍa-nagarake ti paṭirūpake sambādhe khuddakanagare. Uggangala-nagarake ti visama-nagarake</i> (S. V, fol. thau) <i>Kuḍḍa,</i> if this explanation be right, seems to be merely an old and unusual form for <i>kshudra,</i> and the Burmese correction into <i>khudda</i> to be unnecessary: but I venture to think it is more likely to be = <i>kuḍya,</i> and to mean a wall built of mud and sticks, or what is called in India, of wattle and daub. When Buddhaghosa explains <i>uggangala</i> as 'lawless,' he is expressing his view that a town in the jungle is likely to be a heathen, pagan sort of place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> With reference to Childers's note in his Dictionary on <i>mahāsālā,</i> with which every one must entirely agree, Buddhaghosa's explanation of the word will be interesting as a proof (if proof be needed) that the Ceylon scholars are not always trustworthy. He says: - <i>Khattiya­mahāsālā ti khattiya-mahāsārā, sārapattā mahākhattiyā. Eso nayo sabbatha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> Literally 'Put on his under-garment, and taking his upper­garment and his bowl, etc.' This sounds complicated; and why should he take his bowl? The Wanderers when at their lodging places on their travels lived (naturally in that beautiful climate) in undress-with only one robe on, the one from the waist to the feet. When they set out for the village on a visit, or on any ceremonious occasion, they put on the second robe, and (just as a European often carries his great-coat on his arm) carried the third with them. At some convenient spot near the village they would put this also on, and enter - so to speak - in full canonicals. And the bowl belonged to, formed part of, their official costume. See J. I, 55; III, 379; Sum. I, 45, 186; and the note above on Ch. IV, § 37, p. 145.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n101" href="#fn101">101</a>]</sup> <i>Kenakid eva karaṇīyena.</i> Professor Pischel, in his edition of the <i>Assalāyana Sutta</i> (p. 1), prints this expression <i>kenaki devakaraṇīyena,</i> and translates it (p. 28), 'for some religious purpose.' It seems to me that he has been misled by the commentary, which really presupposes the more correct division.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> <i>Samaṇa-brāhmaṇa,</i> which compound may possibly mean Samanas and Brāhmanas as it has usually been rendered, but I think not necessarily. Not one of those here specified were brahmins by birth, as is apparent from the Sumangala Vilāsinī on the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2"><i>Sāmañña­Phala Suttanta,</i></a> §§ 3-7. Compare the use of Kshatriya-brahmano, a soldier priest,' a Kshatriya who offered sacrifice; and of Brahmano, absolutely, as an epithet of an Arahant. In the use of the word <i>samaṇa</i> there seems to me to be a hopeless confusion between, a complete mingling of the meanings of, the two roots &#347;ram and &#347;am (which, in Pāli, would both become <i>sam</i>). It connotes both asceticism and inward peace, and might best be rendered 'devotee,' were it not for the intellectual inferiority implied by that word in our language. A Samaṇa-brahmin should therefore mean a man of any birth, who by his saintliness of life, by his renunciation of the world, and by his reputation as a religious thinker, had acquired the position of a quasi­brahmin and was looked up to by the people with as much respect as they looked up to a brahmin by birth. Compare further my 'Buddhist Birth Stories.' Vol. I, p. 260; and see J. 1, 57, 187; M. I. 285-6. 400; II, 54; A. I, 180; III, 228.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> On these degrees in the religious life, see M. I, 63; A. II, 238). They are described in my 'Buddhism' (21st ed., pp. 108 foll.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> Arahants are those who have reached Nirvana, the 'supreme goal, the highest fruit' of the Aryan Eightfold Path. To live 'the Life that's Right' <i>(sammā)</i> is to live in the Noble Path, each of the eight divisions of which is to be <i>sammā,</i> round, right and perfect, normal and complete. To live right <i>(sammā)</i> is therefore to have:­ (1) Right views, free from superstition; (2) right aims, high and worthy of the intelligent and earnest man; (3) right speech, kindly, open, truthful; (4) right conduct, in all concerns of life; (5) right livelihood, bringing hurt or danger to no living thing; (6) right perseverance, in all the other seven; (7) right mindfulness, the watchful, active mind; (8) right contemplation, earnest thought on the deep mysteries of life. In each of these the word right is <i>sammā,</i> and the whole paragraph being on the Aryan Path, the allusion is certainly to this central doctrine of the Buddhist Dhamma.<br />
					Buddhaghosa says that <i>bhikkhu sammā viharati,</i> who, having himself entered the Aryan Path, leads his brother into it, and this is, no doubt, good Buddhism. But it is a practical application of the text, a theological exegesis, and not a philological explanation. Even so it seems to lay the stress too much on 'bereft,' and too little on 'Arahants.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> Literally 'There is no <i>samaṇa.</i>' See note on § 26. I have followed, though with some doubt, Childers's punctuation. Buddhaghosa refers <i>padesa-vatti</i> to <i>samaṇo;</i> and <i>ito,</i> not to <i>padesa,</i> but to <i>magga,</i> understood; and it is quite possible that this is the correct explanation. On <i>samādhikāni</i> see the comment at Jātaka II, 383: Watters, 'On Yüan Chwāng,' II, 33. and Ed. Hardy, 'Buddhismus.'
					p. 44. Both Paññananda and Samarasekhara render it as above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> That is, Nirvana. Compare Mangala Sutta 10. 11, and the Dhammapada, verses 180, 354, and above, Chap. I, § 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that the last five words in the text (the last twelve words in my translation) were added by the Theras who held the Council. On Subhadda's ordination he has the following interesting note: - 'The Thera (that is, Ānanda), they say, took him on one side, poured water over his head from a water vessel, made him repeat the formula of meditation on the impermanency of the body (see my 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 161), shaved off his hair and beard, clad him in the yellow robes, made him repeat the "Three Refuges," and led him back to the Exalted One. The Exalted One himself admitted him then into the higher rank of the brotherhood, and pointed out to him a subject for meditation <i>(kammaṭṭhāna)</i>. He accepted this. and walking up and down in a quiet part of the grove, he thought and meditated upon it, till overcoming the Evil Spirit, he had acquired Arahantship, and with it the discriminating knowledge of all the Scriptures <i>(Paṭisambhidā)</i>. Then, returning, he came and took his seat beside the Exalted One.'<br />
					According to this, no set ceremony for ordination <i>(Saŋgha­kammaɱ),</i> as laid down in the Vinaya, took place; and it is otherwise probable that no such ceremony was usual in the earliest days of Buddhism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> <i>Bhante</i> or <i>āyasmā,</i>. This question has been fully discussed by Prof. Franke in the <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1908_vi.pdf">'Journal of the Pāli Text Society,' 1908.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> According to tradition (trans. by Rhys Davids and Oldenberg, 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 377 foll.) the Order considered this matter shortly after the Buddha's death, and declined to avail themselves of this permission. As to what these lesser precepts were see Rhys Davids. 'Questions of King Milinda,' I, 202 foll.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> This brother is represented as an obstinate, perverse man; so
					destitute of the proper <i>esprit de corps</i> that he dared to take part with the sisterhood, and against the brotherhood, in a dispute which had arisen between them. But after the social penalty here referred to had been duly imposed upon him, even his proud and independent spirit was tamed; he became humble; his eyes were opened; and he, also, attained to the 'supreme goal' of the Buddhist faith. (The passages arc shown in the index to 'Vinaya Texts.')</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> Comp. D. II. 287.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> Compare above, Chap. II, § 7. By 'the most backward' according to Buddhaghosa, the Exalted One referred to Ānanda, and he said this to encourage him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> The full text and an explanation of this Rapture will be found in
					the translator's 'Buddhism,' pp. 174-6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> These nine states are called in the Milinda, p. 176, the nine Anupubba-Vihāras. We have therefore, in this list, a technical, scholastic, attempt to describe the series of ideas involved in what was considered the highest thought. No one, of course, can have known what actually did occur; and the eight boundary lines between the nine states are purely conjectural.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> Brahmā, the first cause, the highest result of Indian theological speculation, the one God of the Indian Pantheists, is represented as using expressions full of deep allusions to the most characteristic Buddhist doctrines. The <i>Samussaya</i> is the result of the temporary collocation of the 'aggregations' <i>(khandha)</i> of mental and material qualities which give to each being (<i>bhūto,</i> that is, man, animal, god, ghost, fairy, or what not) its outward and visible shape, its individuality. <i>Loka</i> is here not the world in our sense, but the 'locality' in the Buddhist universe which such an individual occupies until it is dissolved. (Comp. Chap. II, §§ 12, 26.) Brahmā appears therefore as a veritable Doctor in theology, and I have been obliged to expand the translation to bring out all the meaning in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> On this celebrated verse see below the Introduction to Mahā­Sudassana-Suttanta. It must be the original of the first verse in the Chinese work, <i>Fa Kheu Pi Hu</i> (Beal, Dhammapada, p. 32), though it is there so changed that every clause has lost its point.</p>

					      <p class="in4">Whatever exists is without endurance,<br />
							And hence the terms 'flourishing' and 'decaying.'<br />
							A man is born, and then he dies.<br />
							Oh, the happiness of escaping from this condition!'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The very meaning which is here the most essential connotation of <i>saŋkhāra</i> is lost in the phrase 'whatever exists.' By a misapprehension of the, no doubt, difficult word <i>Dhamma,</i> which, however, never means 'term,' the second clause has lost its point. And by a grammatical blunder the third clause in the Chinese confines the doctrine, erroneously, to man. In a Chinese tale, called <i>Ngan shih niu,</i> translated by Mr. Deal, in the 'Indian Antiquary' for May, 1880, the following verses occur; and they are possibly another reflection of this stanza:</p>

					      <p class="in4">'All things that exist are transitory,<br />
							They must of necessity perish and disappear;<br />
							Though joined together, there must be separation;<br />
							Where there is life there must be death.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Compare the constantly repeated phrase: - 'Whatsoever hath an origin, in that is inherent the necessity of dissolution.' The perception of this is emphatically called the Eye for the Truth; and the doctrine is referred to in the next section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> In these four stanzas we seem to have the way in which the death of the Buddha would be regarded, as the early Buddhist thought, by four representative persons - the exalted God of the theologians; the Jupiter of the multitude (allowing in the case of each of these for the change in character resulting from their conversion to Buddhism); the holy, thoughtful Arahant; and the loving, childlike disciple.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> Nearly = V, § 6; and below, VI, 19.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> <i>Ugghāyanti.</i> I have followed the reading of my own MS., which is confirmed by the Sumangala Vilāsinī and the Mālālaŋkara­vatthu. <i>Vigghāyanti,</i> which Childers reads, would be questionable Buddhism. The spirits do not become extinct; that is, not as a general rule, as would be implied by the absolute statement: - 'Even the spirits, brethren, become extinct.' It is no doubt true that all spirits, from the lowest to the highest, from the most insignificant fairy to the God of theological speculation, are regarded as temporary. But when they cease to exist as gods or spirits <i>(devatā)</i>, they do not go out, they are not extinguished <i>(vigghāayanti);</i> they continue to exist in some other form. And though that other form would, from the European point of view, be a different being, as there would be no continuity of consciousness, no passage of a 'soul' from the one to the other; it would, from the Buddhist point of view, be the same being, as it would be the resultant effect of the same Karma. There would follow on the death of a <i>devatā,</i> not extinction, but a transmutation of force, a transmigration of character, a passing on, an inheritance of Karma. Only in the exceedingly rare case of an <i>anāgāmin</i>, of which an instance will be found above Chap. II, § 7, could it be said that a spirit becomes extinct.<br />
					The expression 'of worldly mind,' here and above in V, 6, is in Pāli <i>paṭhavi-saññiniyo,</i> an ambiguous phrase which has only as yet been found in this connexion. The word is here opposed to <i>vītarāga,</i> 'free from passion,' and I have therefore taken it in a spiritual sense. There is another possibility, viz. that it is used in an intellectual sense, 'making the idea of earth present to their mind'; and this would be in accordance with the use of <i>saññi</i> in the <i>Kasiṇa</i> meditations, in which spirits, like men, were supposed to indulge; see Dīgha II, 108. But how easily, especially in Buddhism, the intellectual merges into the religious may be seen from such a <i>Kasiṇa</i> phrase as <i>maraṇa-saññino,</i> used at Mahāvaɱsa V, 159, of good men.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> See the end of the first paragraph of this section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> The dress of the Mallas consisted probably of mere lengths of muslin or cotton cloth; and a suit of apparel consisted of two or, at the outside, of three of these - one to wrap around the loins, one to throw over the shoulders, and one to use as a turban. To make a canopy on occasions of state they would join such pieces together; to make the canopy into a tent they would simply add walls of the same material; and the only decoration, as simple as it is beautiful, would be wreaths of flowers, or single lotuses, hanging from the roof, or stretched along the sides. Every civil servant travelling on duty in remote districts in Ceylon has such a tent or canopy put up for him by the peasantry.</p>

							<p>One can see that the issue is respect versus superstition. Precisely how this worked is speculation on my part, but I propose that to take the body, keeping it outside the village, to the South of the village, where executions took place and the charnal ground lay would be disrespectful. The respectful thing was to exit via the East gate, towards the rising sun. To exit the East gate the village would need to be entered. To enter via the south gate would provoke superstitions (rise of the dead, allowing in spirits of the dead, etc.), as possibly would entering by way of the West gate (the setting sun, possibly just psychologically depressing), therefore they chose the North gate.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> The point of this interesting legend is that that the inhabitants of an lndian village of that time would have considered it a desecration or pollution to bring a dead body into or through their village. Authorities differ as to the direction in which it should be taken to avoid this. The old custom, according to Caland (p. 23) was to take it to the East or the West. Later priestly books (Manu, for instance, V, 92) say to the North. The Mallas wanted to go to the South. The remedy proposed by the spirits who are shocked at this impropriety, is more shocking still.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> At p. xxvi of the Introduction to his edition of the Vinaya, Prof. Oldenberg identifies this Subhdda with Subhadda the last convert, mentioned above at the end of Chap. V. They are different persons; the last convert being represented as a man of high character, incapable of the conduct here ascribed to this Subhadda. The last convert was a brahmin, traditionally supposed to be younger brother to <i>Aññā Kondañña,</i> the first convert; this Subhadda had been a barber in the village Ātumā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> It is possible that we have here the survival of some ancient custom. Spence Hardy appropriately refers to a ceremony among Jews (of what place or time is not mentioned) in the following terms: ­ 'Just before a Jew is taken out of the house to he buried, the relatives and acquaintances of the departed stand round the coffin; when the feet are uncovered; and each in rotation lays hold of the great toes, and begs pardon for any offence given to the deceased, and requests a favourable mention of them in the next world' ('Manual of Buddhism,' p. 348).<br />
					The Buddhist bhikkhus in Siam and the great majority of those in Ceylon (the adherents of the Siyam-samāgama) always keep one shoulder uncovered. It is evident that the bhikkhus in Burma and those in Ceylon, who belong to the Amara-pura-samāgama, arc more in accordance with ancient custom in wearing the robe ordinarily over both shoulders.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> There is something very quaint in the way in which the faithful Mallas are here represented as bringing coals to Newcastle. The 'storehouse of the waters' is in Pāli <i>udaka-sālā,</i> on which Buddhaghosa has two theories: first, that the Sāla trees around shed down a miraculous rain from their trunks and branches and leaves; and next, that the waters burst up from the earth and became as it were a diadem of crystal round the pyre. On the belief that water thus burst up miraculously through the earth, see 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 64, 67. If the reading be correct it is scarcely possible that <i>sālā</i> can here have anything to do with Sāla trees; but the other interpretation is open to the objections that <i>sālā</i> means an open hall rather than a storehouse, and that the belief in a 'storehouse of water' has not, as yet, been found elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> Here again the commentator expands and adds to the comparatively simple version of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> Here closes Buddhaghosa's long and edifying commentary. He has no note on the following Verses, which he says were added by Theras in Ceylon. The additional verse found in the Phayre MS. was in the same way probably added in Burma.</p>
