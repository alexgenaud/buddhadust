					<h4><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The general conclusions we have to draw as to the gradual growth of the various books in the Buddhist canon have been stated in <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.010.literature.htm">Chapter X of <i>'Buddhist India.'</i></a> To work out the details of it will be greatly facilitated by tabular statements of the differences and resemblances found in the various books, whether in matters of form or of ideas. The following table gives a list of all such passages in this book as have, so far, been traced elsewhere. Others will, no doubt, be discovered; but those here given will throw some light on the method of construction followed in the book. Only parallel passages are given, passages in which some other book has at least a paragraph or more couched in identical, or almost identical, words.</p>

					<p>A glance at column three, giving the pages of the text, shows a remarkable result. There are ninety-six pages of Pali text, beginning on p. 72. With a few gaps - pp. 92, 3; 113-15; 117-21; 130-3; 137-40; 148-50; 153; i58-60; 164-7 (nine in number)-the whole text is found, in nearly identical words, elsewhere. The gaps, filled with matter found only in the Book of the Great Decease, amount altogether to about 32 or 33 pages, that is to about one-third of the whole. That proportion would be reduced if we were to include passages of similar tendency, or passages of shorter length.</p>

					<p>Secondly; the parallel passages are found, without exception, in those books which belong to the oldest portion of the canon. In <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.010.literature.htm#pg188">'Buddhist India,' p. 188,</a> there is a table showing, in groups, the probable relative order in time of the Buddhist literature down to the time of Asoka.</p>

					<p>All these passages belong to the two earliest groups; all are found in books included in groups 4-6; not one occurs in any of the books included in the later groups - groups 7, 8, 9, and 10. So far as it goes, therefore, the present table is in harmony with the order suggested in the table referred to.</p>

					<p>Thirdly; the slight differences, the more important of which</p>

					<p>are noted in the table, are very suggestive. No. 26 is the episode of the stanzas uttered at the moment of the Buddha's death. The Saṃyutta gives it in the Brahma-Saṃyutta because the first verse is attributed to Brahmā. The last two verses are there put into the mouths of Ānanda and Anuruddha respectively, perhaps because Anuruddha's verse forms a more fitting conclusion. In the Dīgha Ānanda's comes last, either in deprecation of Ānanda (which is scarcely probable), or for the reason given in the note to the translation.</p>

					<p>In No. 14 we have four lines of verse, and the prose introductory to them, ascribed in the Dīgha to the Buddha, ascribed in the Aṇguttara to a former teacher whose story is there told by the Buddha. That previous teacher, though not a Buddha, is highly praised in the story; the epithet applied to him in the verses <i>(satthā)</i> is quite in the right place in that connexion; and the verses when spoken by the Buddha of another teacher, are quite appropriate. On the other hand, when put as the Dīgha puts them, into the mouth of the Buddha as spoken of himself, they are not in the best of taste, and sound forced. There can, I think, be no doubt but that the application of these verses to Sunetta the Teacher was the original one, and that the little poem was only later applied to the Buddha himself. But it does not follow in the least that the Aṇguttara is older than the Dīgha. For, as is shown by the references in the table, the Aṇguttara itself contains, in an earlier part of the work, the later application of these verses. There it gives the episode, word for word, as it occurs in the Dīgha. The two passages cannot be of the same age. It is not possible that the same story was told originally of two different people. But the two collections <i>(Nikāyas)</i> may very, well have been put together, from older materials of varying age, at the same time.</p>

					<p>No. 30 is the episode of the explosion of ill-will on the part of Subhadda. There is a slight but very suggestive difference here between the two texts, one found in our Suttanta the other in the Pañcasatika Khandaka of the Vinaya. For convenience of comparison the two versions of this episode are here reprinted side by side.</p>

And the venerable Mahā Kassapa left the high road, and sat himself down at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

							<p>Just at that time a certain ascetic who had picked up a Mandārava flower in Kusinārā was coming along the high road to Pāvā. Now the venerable Mahā Kassapa saw the ascetic coming in the distance, and on seeing him he said to that ascetic:</p>

							<p>'O friend! surely thou knowest our Master?'</p>

							<p>'Yea, friend! I know him. This day the Samaṇa Gotama has been dead a week. That is how I obtained this Mandārava flower.'</p>

							<p>'Impermanent are all component things! How is it possible that (they should not be dissolved?).'</p>

							<p>Now at that time a brother named Subhadda, who had been received into the Order in his old age, was seated in that company. And Subhadda, the recruit in his old age, said to those brethren:</p>

							<p>'Enough, Sirs! Weep not, neither lament! We are well rid of the great Samaṇa. We used to be annoyed by being told: "This beseems you, this beseems you not." But now we shall be able <a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> to do whatever we like; and what we do not like, that we shall not do!'</p>

							<p>'Enough, my brethren! Weep not, neither lament! Has not the Exalted One formerly declared this, that it is in the very nature of all things near and dear unto us that we must divide ourselves from them, leave them, sever ourselves from them?

					<p>A glance at the above columns shows that the two texts are identical except in two particulars. The Dīgha gives the episode in narrative form, whereas the Vinaya puts it into the mouth of Kassapa himself. And secondly, whereas the Dīgha puts Kassapa's speech after the outburst of Subhadda, the Vinaya puts it before - that is, the last two paragraphs in the Dīgha are transposed in the Vinaya.</p>

					<p>Professor Oldenberg, who was the first to point out (more than thirty years ago)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn1" href="#in1">i1</a>]</sup></span> the parallelism between the two texts, acutely suggests that the change is due to the position occupied by this episode in the Vinaya. It is there used as introduction to the account of the Council at Rājagaha held, according to the tradition, to counteract such sentiments as were expressed in Subhadda's outburst. It was considered more appropriate, therefore, that in that connexion, Subhadda's words should come last, to lead up to what follows. The whole of the story is accordingly taken from our Suttanta. But the last paragraphs are transposed, and the whole is put into the mouth of Kassapa, on whose advice the Council is stated to have been convened.</p>

					<p>This seems a very probable explanation of the transposition, and of the existence of two slightly different accounts of the <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> episode. If we accept it - and I think we should<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn2" href="#in2">i2</a>]</sup></span> - we have to face the further question: Why was the episode inserted in the Dīgha? It is given there in the middle of the account of the cremation of the Buddha at Kusinārā. It has very little to do either with what precedes, or with what follows it; and is said to have taken place away from Kusinārā. The outburst itself was of little importance in the long story of the Buddha's last days; and (in the older order as preserved in the Dīgha) is immediately overwhelmed by Mahā Kassapa's apt quotation from the Master's words. Have we not here a very similar motive, acting on either the same or very similar minds? Is it not precisely the part played by this anecdote in the traditional account of the First Council that led the compilers of the Dīgha to find a place for it in the Book of the Great Decease? They might so easily have left it out. As it stands it only breaks in upon the narrative. And, apart from the tradition about the First Council, it had no importance.</p>

					<p>There has been much discussion both for and against the authenticity of this First Council. Is this really necessary? Oldenberg's analysis of the comparative date of the different parts of the Vinaya has shown conclusively that the record, as we have it, is later than the Council of Vesālī, that is at least a hundred years later than the meeting whose proceedings it purports to record. What can be the value of so late a record? It may be objected to this that though the extant record is late the tradition may be older. No one can prove that it was not. But this would not help matters at all. We must then point out that the details as given are, as one might expect, quite inaccurate.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn3" href="#in3">i3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Space will only allow of one example being taken.</p>

					<p>It is well known that all the ancient sacred literatures of the world have grown up gradually, and are a mosaic of earlier <a id="pg77"><span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></a> and later material. The Buddhist Piṭakas form no exception. As regards the <i>Nikāyas</i> I have shown this elsewhere in considerable detail.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn4" href="#in4">i4</a>]</sup></span> Now the record, as we have it, presupposes the existence, already at the time of the Buddha's death, of the Five <i>Nikāyas</i> in their present arrangement!</p>

					<p>It follows that both on general principles of comparative criticism, and on consideration of a particular instance in this special case, the details given us in the Vinaya about the First Council cannot be trusted. But it does not follow, as a matter of certainty, that there was no Council at all. It is quite possible, and even probable, that the Order held a 'General Chapter,' as we should call it, soon after the Buddha's death. They kept no proper minutes of the meeting. We may conjecture what happened at it, but it would be only conjecture. And we must continue patiently, from the incidental references in the books themselves, to formulate a probable theory as to the method in which the literature gradually sprang up. The record handed down to us in the Vinaya is authentic enough; but only in the only way in which any such record can be considered authentic, that is, as evidence of beliefs held at the date at which it was composed.</p>

					the Exalted One held that comprehen­sive religious talk<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now when the Exalted One had sojourned<br />
					as long as he thought fit at Nālandā,<br />
					he addressed the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord!"<br />
					said Ānanda, in assent,<br />
					to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One proceeded,<br />
					with a great com­pany of the brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">20. Now the disciples at Pāṭaligāma<br />
					heard of his arrival there,<br />
					and they went on to the place where he was,<br />
					took their seats respectfully beside him,<br />
					and invited him to their village rest-house.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One signified,<br />
					by silence,<br />
					his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Then the Pāṭaligāma disciples<br />
					seeing that he had accepted the invitation,<br />
					rose from their seats,<br />
					and went away to the rest-house,<br />
					bowing to the Exalted One<br />
					and keeping him on their right<br />
					as they passed him.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arriving there<br />
					they strewed all the rest-house<br />
					with fresh sand,<br />
					placed seats in it,<br />
					set up a water-pot,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then they returned to the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">22. And the Exalted One robed himself,<br />
					took his bowl and other things,<br />

					washed his feet,<br />
					entered the hall,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the brethren also,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Pāṭaligāma disciples too,<br />

					<p class="f4">23. Then the Exalted One<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">24. Fivefold, 0 householders,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the first place<br />

					<p class="f4">This, 0 householders,<br />

					<p class="f4">25. When the Exalted One<br />

					and incited them,<br />
					and roused them,<br />
					and gladdened them,<br />
					far into the night<br />
					with religious discourse,<br />
					he dismissed them,<br />
					saying: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">"The night is far spent, 0 householders.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is time for you<br />
					to do what you deem most fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, lord!"<br />
					answered the disciples of Pāṭaligāma,<br />
					and they rose from their seats,<br />
					and bowing to the Exalted One,<br />
					and keeping him on their right hand<br />
					as they passed him,<br />
					they departed thence.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">&sect;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br />
					not long after the disciples <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> of Pāṭaligāma<br />
					had departed thence,<br />
					entered into his private chamber.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">26. At that time Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					were building a fortress at Pāṭaligāma<br />
					to repel the Vajjians,<br />
					and there were a number of fairies<br />
					who haunted in thousands<br />
					the plots of ground there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, wherever ground is so occupied<br />

					they bend the hearts<br />

					they bend the hearts of middling kings and ministers<br />

					<p class="f4">27. And the Blessed One,<br />
					with great and clear vision,<br />

					saw thousands of those fairies<br />
					haunting Pāṭaligāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he rose up very early in the morning,<br />
					and said to Ānanda: -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who is it then, Ānanda,<br />
					who is building a fortress<br />
					at Pāṭaligāma?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sunidha and Vassakāra, lord,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					are building a fortress there<br />
					to keep back the Vajjians."</p>

					<p class="f4">28. "They act, Ānanda,<br />
					as if they had consulted<br />
					with the Tāvatiṃsa angels.</p>

					<p class="f4">I Ānanda<br />
					with great and clear vision,<br />
					surpassing that of ordinary men,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, wherever ground is so occupied<br />

					<p class="f4">And as far, Ānanda,<br />
					as Aryan people resort,<br />
					as far as merchants travel,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> 29. Now Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					proceeded to the place<br />
					where the Exalted One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they had come there<br />
					they exchanged with the Exalted One<br />
					the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and stood there respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, so standing,<br />
					Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					spake thus to the Exalted One: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">"May the venerable Gotama do us the honour<br />
					of taking his meal,<br />
					together with the company of the brethren,<br />
					at our house to-day."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One signified,<br />
					by silence,<br />
					his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">30. Then when Sunidha and Vassakāra,<br />
					the chief ministers of Magadha,<br />
					perceived that he had given his consent,<br />
					they returned to the place where they dwelt.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on arriving there,<br />
					they prepared sweet dishes<br />
					of boiled rice,<br />
					and cakes;<br />
					and informed the Exalted One,<br />
					saying: ­</p>

					<p class="f4">"The hour of food has come, 0 Gotama,<br />
					and all is ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One robed himself early,<br />
					took his bowl with him,<br />
					and repaired, with the brethren,<br />
					to the dwelling-place of Sunidha and Vassakāra<br />
					and sat down on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And with their own hands<br />
					they set the sweet rice and the cakes<br />
					before the brethren<br />
					with the Buddha at their head,<br />
					and waited on them<br />
					till they had had enough.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One<br />
					had finished eating his meal,<br />
					the ministers brought a low seat,<br />
					and sat down respectfully at his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">31. And when they were thus seated<br />
					the Exalted One gave thanks in these verses: ­</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Wheresoe'er the prudent man shall take up his abode<br />
							<a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a><br /> Let him support the brethren there, good men of self-control,<br />

							Revered, they will revere him: honoured, they honour him again;<br />
							Are gracious to him as a mother to her own, her only son.<br />
							And the man who has the grace of the gods, good fortune he beholds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">32. And when he had thanked the ministers in these verses<br />
					he rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they followed him as he went, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">"The gate the Samana Gotama goes out by to-day<br />
					shall be called Gotama's gate,<br />
					and the ferry at which he crosses the river<br />
					shall be called Gotama's ferry."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the gate he went out at<br />
					was called Gotama's gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">33. But the Exalted One went on to the river.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time the river Ganges<br />
					was brimful and over­flowing;<br />
					and wishing to cross to the opposite bank,<br />
					some began to seek for boats,<br />
					some for rafts of wood,<br />
					whilst some made rafts of basket-work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One<br />
					as instantaneously as a strong man<br />
					would stretch forth his arm,<br />
					or draw it back again<br />
					when he had stretched it forth,<br />
					vanished from this side of the river,<br />
					and stood on the further bank<br />
					with the company of the brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">34. And the Exalted One beheld<br />
					the people who wished to cross to the opposite bank<br />
					looking some of them for boats<br />
					and some of them for rafts of wood,<br />
					and some of them for rafts of basket-work;<br />
					and as he beheld them<br />
					he brake forth at that time<br />
					into this song:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> "They who have crossed the ocean drear<br />

					<h3 class="ctr"><a id="ch2">Chapter II.</a></h3>

					<p class="f4">1. Now the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, Ānanda, let us go on to Koṭigāma"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord!"<br />
					said Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One proceeded<br />
					with a great company of the brethren<br />
					to Koṭigāma;<br />
					and there he stayed in the village itself.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. And at that place<br />
					the Exalted One addressed the brethren,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is through not understanding and grasping<br />
					four Aryan Truths, 0 brethren,<br />
					that we have had to run so long,<br />
					to wander so long<br />
					in this weary path of transmigration,<br />
					both you and I!</p>

					<p class="f4">And what are these four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Aryan truth about sorrow;<br />
					the Aryan truth about the cause of sorrow;<br />
					the Aryan truth about the cessation of sorrow;<br />
					and the Aryan truth about the path<br />
					that leads to that cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when these Aryan truths<br />
					are grasped and known<br />
					the craving for future life<br />
					is rooted out,<br />
					that which leads to renewed becoming<br />
					is destroyed,<br />
					and then there is no more birth!"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">3. Thus spake the Exalted One;<br />
					and when the Happy One had thus spoken,<br />
					then again the Teacher said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"By not seeing the Aryan Truths as they really are,<br />
							Long is the path that is traversed through many a birth:<br />
							<a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> When these are grasped, the cause of rebirth is removed,<br />
							The root of sorrow uprooted, and then there is no more birth."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. There too, while staying at Koṭigāma,<br />
					the Exalted One held that comprehensive religious talk<br />
					with the brethren,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such and such is upright conduct;<br />
					such and such is earnest contemplation;<br />
					such and such is intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great becomes the fruit,<br />
					great the advantage of earnest contemplation,<br />
					when it is set round with upright conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great the advantage of intellect<br />
					when it is set round with earnest contemplation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind set round with intelligence<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now when the Exalted One had remained<br />

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord!"<br />
					said Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One proceeded to the Nādikas<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br />
					by a strong effort of the will,<br />
					bent that sickness down again,<br />
					and kept his hold on life<br />
					till the time he fixed upon should come.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the sickness abated upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">24. Now very soon after<br />
					the Blessed One began to recover.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had quite got rid of the sickness,<br />
					he came out from his lodging,<br />
					and sat down in the shadow thereof<br />
					on a seat spread out there.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> the venerable Ānanda<br />
					went to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and saluted him,<br />
					and took a seat respectfully on one side,<br />
					and addressed the Exalted One,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have beheld, lord,<br />
					how the Exalted One was in health,<br />
					and I have beheld<br />
					how the Exalted One had to suffer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And though at the sight<br />
					of the sickness of the Exalted One<br />
					my body became weak as a creeper,<br />
					and the horizon became dim to me,<br />
					and my faculties were no longer clear,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span><br />
					yet notwithstanding<br />
					I took some little comfort<br />
					from the thought that the Exalted One<br />
					would not pass away<br />
					until at least he had left instructions<br />
					as touching the Order."</p>

					<p class="f4">25. "What, then, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does the Order expect that of me?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have preached the truth<br />
					without making any distinction<br />
					between exoteric and esoteric doctrine;<br />
					for in respect of the truths, Ānanda,<br />
					the Tathāgata has no such thing<br />
					as the closed fist of a teacher,<br />
					who keeps some things back.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Surely, Ānanda,<br />
					should there be any one<br />
					who harbours the thought,<br />
					'It is I who will lead the brotherhood,'<br />
					or,<br />
					'The Order is dependent upon me,'<br />
					it is he who should lay down instructions<br />
					in any matter concerning the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Tathāgata, Ānanda, thinks not<br />
					that it is he who should lead the brotherhood,<br />
					or that the Order is dependent upon him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why then should he leave instructions<br />
					in any matter concerning the Order?</p>

					<p class="f4">I too, 0 Ānanda, am now grown old,<br />
					and full of years,<br />
					my journey is drawing to its close,<br />
					I have reached my sum of days.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am turning eighty years of age;<br />
					and just as a worn-out cart, Ānanda,<br />
					can be kept going only with the help of thongs,<br />
					so, methinks, the body of the Tathāgata<br />
					can only be kept going<br />
					by bandaging it up.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is only, Ānanda when the Tathāgata,<br />
					by <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> ceasing to attend to any outward thing,<br />
					becomes plunged<br />
					by the cessation of any separate sensation<br />
					in that concentration of heart<br />
					which is concerned with no material object -<br />
					it is only then<br />
					that the body of the Tathāgata is at ease.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">26. <span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span>Therefore, 0 Ānanda,<br />
					be ye lamps unto your­selves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye a refuge to yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Betake yourselves to no external refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hold fast to the Truth as a lamp.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hold fast as a refuge to the Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Look not for refuge<br />
					to any one besides yourselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Ānanda, is a brother<br />
					to be a lamp unto himself,<br />
					a refuge to himself,<br />
					betaking himself<br />
					to no external refuge,<br />
					holding fast to the Truth as a lamp,<br />
					holding fast as a refuge to the Truth,<br />
					looking not for refuge to any one besides himself?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, 0 mendicants,<br />

					<p class="f4">And whosoever, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">1.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span> Now the Exalted One robed himself early in the morning,<br />

					<p class="f4">When, after he had returned<br />

					<p class="f4">"So be it, lord!"<br />

					<p class="f4">And taking up the mat<br />

					<p class="f4">2. So the Exalted One proceeded<br />
					to the Chapala Shrine,<br />
					and when he had come there<br />
					he sat down on the mat spread out for him,<br />
					and the venerable Ānanda took his seat<br />
					respectfully beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">1. Now the Exalted One early in the morning robed himself,<br />
					and taking his bowl,<br />
					entered Vesāli for alms;<br />
					and when he had passed through Vesāli,<br />
					and had eaten his meal and was returning from his alms­seeking he gazed at Vesāli with an elephant look<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn66" href="#n66">66</a>]</sup></span>and addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">' This will be the last time, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to Bhaṇḍa-gāma;<br />

					<p class="f4">13. Now when the Exalted One had remained as long as he desired at Bhoga-gama, he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Ānanda, let us go on to Pāvā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg137"><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></a> And there at Pāvā the Exalted One stayed at the Mango Grove of Chunda,<br />

					<p class="f4">14. Now Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />

					<p class="f4">And Chunda, the worker in metals, went to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />

					<p class="f4">And when he was thus seated,<br />

					<p class="f4">15. Then he, instructed, aroused, incited, and gladdened by the religious discourse,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One signified, by silence, his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">16. Then seeing that the Exalted One had consented, Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />

					and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him,<br />
					departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Now at the end of the night, Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he <a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> announced the hour to the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The hour, lord, has come,<br />

					<p class="f4">18. And the Exalted One robed himself early in the morning,<br />

					<p class="f4">When he had come thither he seated himself on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated he addressed Chunda, the worker in metals, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now the Exalted One addressed Chunda, the worker in metals, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">I see no one, Chunda, on earth nor in Māra's heaven,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said Chunda, the worker in metals, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever truffles remained over those he buried in a hole.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One then rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">20. Now when the Exalted One had eaten the rice prepared by Chunda, the worker in metals,<br />
					there fell upon him a dire sickness,<br />
					the disease of dysentery,<br />

					even unto death.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One, mindful and self-possessed,<br />

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> And the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Now the Exalted One went aside from the path to the foot of a certain tree;<br />

					<p class="f4">'Fold, I pray you, Ānanda, the robe" in four;<br />
					and spread it out for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am weary, Ānanda, and must rest awhile!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One,<br />
					and spread out the robe folded fourfold.</p>

					<p class="f4">22. And the Exalted One seated himself on the seat prepared for him;<br />
					and when he was seated,<br />
					he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					some water.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda, and would drink.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But just now, lord, about five hundred carts have gone over.</p>

					<p class="f4">That water stirred up by the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and turbid.</p>

					<p class="f4">This river Kakuṭṭha, lord,<br />

					is clear and pleasant,<br />
					cool and transparent,<br />
					easy to <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a>  get down into,<br />
					and delightful.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One may both drink the water,<br />
					and cool his limbs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">23. Again the second time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					some water.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda, and would drink.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And again the second time the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But just now, lord, about five hundred carts have gone over.</p>

					<p class="f4">That water stirred up by the wheels has become shallow and flows fouled and turbid.</p>

					<p class="f4">This river Kakuṭṭha, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">24. Again the third time the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					some water.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda, and would drink.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One:<br />
					and taking a bowl he went down to the streamlet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And lo! the streamlet which,<br />
					stirred up by the wheels,<br />
					was but just now become shallow,<br />
					and was flowing fouled and turbid,<br />
					had begun, when the venerable Ānanda came up to it,<br />
					to flow clear and bright and free from all turbidity.</p>

					<p class="f4">25. Then Ānanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How wonderful, how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tathāgata!<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">For this streamlet which,<br />

					now, as I come up to it,<br />
					is flowing clear and bright and free from all turbidity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And taking water in the bowl he returned towards the Exalted One;<br />
					and when he had come where the Exalted One was he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">How wonderful, <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> how marvellous is the great might and power of the Tathāgata!</p>

					<p class="f4">For this streamlet which,<br />

					was but just now become shallow and was flowing foul and turbid,<br />
					now, as I come up to it,<br />

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One drink the water!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Happy One drink the water!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One drank of the water.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">26. Now at that time a man named Pukkusa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					a young Mallian,<br />
					a disciple of Aḷāra Kālāma's, was passing along the high road from Kusinārā to Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					saw the Exalted One seated at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him, he went up to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and when he had come there he saluted the Exalted One,<br />
					and took his rest respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How wonderful a thing it is, lord!<br />
					and how marvellous,<br />
					that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm!</p>

					<p class="f4">27. 'Formerly, lord, Aḷāra Kālāma was once walking along the high road;<br />
					and leaving the road he sat himself down under a certain tree to rest during the heat of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, lord, five hundred carts passed by one after the other,<br />
					each close to Aḷāra Kālāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain man,<br />
					who was following close behind that caravan of carts,<br />
					went up to the place where Aḷāra Kālāma was,<br />
					and when he was come there he spake as follows to Aḷāra Kālāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, did you see those five hundred carts go by?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, indeed, I saw them not."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> '"But, lord, did you hear the sound of them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"No, indeed, sir, I heard not their sound?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, were you then asleep?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"No, sir, I was not asleep?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, were you then conscious?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Even so, sir?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"So that you, lord, though you were both conscious and awake,<br />
					neither saw,<br />
					nor heard the sound of five hundred carts passing by,<br />
					one after the other,<br />
					and each close to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, lord, even your robe was sprinkled over with the dust of them!"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"It is even so, sir."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then thought that man:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How wonderful a thing is it,<br />
					and how marvellous,<br />
					that those who have gone forth out of the world should pass their time in a state of mind so calm!</p>

					<p class="f4">So much so that a man though being both conscious and awake,<br />
					neither sees,<br />
					nor hears the sound of five hundred carts passing by,<br />
					one after the other,<br />
					and each close to him."</p>

					<p class="f4">'And after giving utterance to his deep faith in Aḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					he departed thence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">28. 'Now what think you, Pukkusa,<br />
					which is the more difficult thing either to do or to meet with -<br />
					that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					should neither see,<br />
					nor hear the sound of five hundred carts passing by,<br />
					one after the other,<br />
					close to him, -<br />
					or that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					should neither see,<br />
					nor hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings are flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts are crashing?'</p>

					<p class="f4">29.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What in comparison, lord,<br />
					can these five hundred carts do,<br />
					or six or seven or eight or nine or ten hundred,<br />
					yea, even hundreds and thousands of carts?</p>

					<p class="f4">That certainly is more difficult,<br />
					both to do and to meet with,<br />
					that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					should neither see,<br />
					nor hear the sound thereof when the falling rain goes on beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings are flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts are crashing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">30. 'Now on one occasion, Pukkusa,<br />
					I was dwelling <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> at Ātumā,<br />
					and was at the Threshing-floor.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time the falling rain began to beat and to splash,<br />
					and the lightnings to flash forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts to crash;<br />
					and two peasants, brothers,<br />
					and four oxen were killed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Pukkusa,a great multitude of people went forth from Ātumā,<br />
					and went up to the place where the two peasants, brothers,<br />
					and the four oxen, lay killed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">31. 'Now at that time, Pukkusa,<br />
					I had gone forth from the Threshing-floor,<br />
					and was walking up and down thinking at the entrance to the Threshing-floor.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain man came, Pukkusa,<br />
					out of that great multitude of people,<br />
					up to the place where I was;<br />
					and when he came up he saluted me,<br />
					and took his place respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he stood there, Pukkusa,<br />
					I said to the man:</p>

					<p class="f4">32. '"Why then, sir, is this great multitude of people assembled together?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But just now, the falling rain began to beat and to splash,<br />
					and the lightnings to flash forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts to crash;<br />
					and two peasants, brothers, were killed,<br />
					and four oxen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore is this great multitude of people gathered together.</p>

					<p class="f4">But where, lord, were you?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, have been here all the while."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But, lord, did you see it?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, saw nothing."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"But; lord, did you hear it?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, heard nothing."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Were you then, lord, asleep?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"I, sir, was not asleep."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Were you then conscious, lord?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Even so, sir."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"So that you, lord, being conscious and awake,<br />
					neither saw,<br />
					nor heard the sound thereof when the falling rain went on beating and splashing,<br />
					and the lightnings were flashing forth,<br />
					and the thunderbolts were crashing."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'"That is so, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">33. 'Then, Pukkusa, the thought occurred to that man:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> '"How wonderful a thing is it,<br />

					<p class="f4">so that a man, being conscious and awake,<br />
					neither sees,<br />
					nor hears the sound thereof when the falling rain is beating and splashing,<br />

					and the thunderbolts are crashing."</p>

					<p class="f4">And after giving utterance to his deep faith in me,<br />
					he departed from me<br />
					[with the customary demonstrations of respect].'</p>

					<p class="f4">34. And when he had thus spoken, Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					addressed the Blessed One in these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now I, lord, as to the faith that I had in Aḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					that I winnow away as in a mighty wind,<br />
					and wash it away as in a swiftly running stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent, lord, are the words of thy mouth,<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal that which is hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br />
					so that those who have eyes can see external forms -<br />
					just even so, lord,<br />
					has the truth been made known to me,<br />
					in many a figure,<br />
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, even I, betake myself, lord,<br />
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Truth,<br />
					and to the Brotherhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as a disciple,<br />
					as a true believer,<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					as long as life endures!'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">35. Now Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					addressed a certain man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fetch me, I pray you, my good man,<br />
					a pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So be it, sir!'<br />
					said that man, in assent, to Pukkusa, the young Mallian;<br />
					and he brought a pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> And the Mallian Pukkusa presented the pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear, to the Exalted One, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold is ready for wear.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One show me favour and accept it at my hands!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In that case, Pukkusa, robe me in one,<br />
					and Ānanda in one.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said Pukkusa, in assent, to the Exalted One;<br />
					and in one he robed the Exalted One,<br />
					and in one, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">36. Then the Exalted One instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened Pukkusa, the young Mallian,<br />
					with religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Pukkusa, the young Mallian,</p>

					<p class="f4">when he had been instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened by the Exalted One with religious discourse,<br />
					arose from his seat,<br />
					and bowed down before the Exalted One;<br />
					and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him,<br />
					departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">37. Now not long after the Mallian Pukkusa had gone,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda placed that pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
					burnished and ready for wear,<br />
					on the body of the Exalted One;<br />
					and when it was so placed on the body of the Exalted One<br />
					it appeared to have lost its splendour!"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How wonderful a thing is it, lord,<br />
					and how marvellous,<br />
					that the colour of the skin of the Exalted One should <a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> be so clear,<br />
					so exceeding bright!</p>

					<p class="f4">For when I placed even this pair of robes of burnished cloth of gold and ready for wear on the body of the Exalted One,<br />
					lo! it seemed as if }t had lost its splendour!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is even so, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two occasions, Ānanda, on which the colour of the skin of a Tathāgata becomes clear and exceeding bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the two?</p>

					<p class="f4">'On the night, Ānanda, on which a Tathāgata attains to the supreme and perfect insight,<br />
					and on the night in which he passes finally away in that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain -<br />
					on these two occasions the colour of the skin of the Tathāgata becomes clear and exceeding bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">38. 'And now this day, Ānanda,<br />
					at the third watch of the night,<br />
					in the Upavattana of Kusinārā,<br />
					in the Sāla Grove of the Mallians,<br />
					between the twin Sāla trees,<br />
					the utter passing away of the Tathāgata will take place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go on to the river Kakutthā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The pair of robes of cloth of gold,<br />
							All burnished, Pukkusa had brought,<br />
							Clad on with them the Master then<br />
							Shone forth in colour like to gold!<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn79" href="#n79">79</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">39. Now the Exalted One with a great company of the brethren went on to the river Kakutthā;<br />
					and when he had come there,<br />
					he went down into the water,<br />
					and bathed,<br />
					and drank.</p>

					<p class="f4">And coming up out agatn on the other side he went on to the Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> And when he was come there he addressed the venerable Chundaka, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Fold, I pray you, Chundaka, a robe in four and spread it out.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am weary, Chundaka, and would lie down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said the venerable Chundaka, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he folded a robe in four,<br />
					and spread it out.</p>

					<p class="f4">40. And the Exalted One laid himself down on his right side,<br />
					with one foot resting on the other;<br />
					and calm and self-possessed he meditated,<br />
					intending to rise up again in clue time.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Chundaka seated himself there in front of the Exalted One.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">41. The Buddha to Kakutthā's river came,<br />
							Whose clear and pleasant waters limpid flow.<br />
							He plunged beneath the stream wearied and worn,<br />
							The Buddha without equal in the world!<br />
							When he had bathed and drunk, the teacher then<br />
							Crossed o'er, the brethren thronging round his steps:<br />
							The Blessed Master, preaching the while the truth,<br />
							The Mighty Sage came to the Mango Grove.<br />
							There spake he to the brother Chundaka: ­<br />
							Spread me the fourfold robe out as a couch.'<br />
							Urged by the Holy One, he quickly spread<br />
							The fourfold robe in order on the ground.<br />
							The Master laid him clown, wearied and worn;<br />
							And there, before him, Chunda took his seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">42. And the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now it may happen. Ānanda,<br />
					that some one should stir up remorse in Chunda the smith,<br />
					by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is evil to thee, Chunda,<br />
					and loss to thee in that when the Tathāgata had eaten his last meal from thy provision,<br />
					then he died."</p>

					<p class="f4">Any such remorse, Ānanda, in Chunda the smith should be checked by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is good to thee, Chunda,<br />
					and gain to thee,<br />
					in that when the Tathāgata had eaten his last meal from thy provision,<br />
					then he died.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the very mouth of the Exalted One, Chunda,<br />
					have I heard, <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> from his own mouth have I received this saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These two offerings of food are of equal fruit,<br />
					and of equal profit,<br />
					and of much greater fruit<br />
					and much greater profit<br />
					than any other -<br />
					and which are the two?</p>

					<p class="f4">The offering of food which,<br />
					when a Tathāgata has eaten,<br />
					he attains to supreme and perfect insight;<br />
					and the offering of food which,<br />
					when a Tathāgata has eaten,<br />
					he passes away by that utter passing away in which nothing whatever remains behind -<br />
					these two offerings of food are of equal fruit and of equal profit,<br />
					and of much greater fruit and much greater profit than any others.</p>

					<p class="f4">There has been laid up by Chunda the smith a karma<br />
					redounding to length of life,<br />
					redounding to good birth,<br />
					redounding to good fortune,<br />
					redounding to good fame,<br />
					redounding to the inheritance of heaven,<br />
					and of sovereign power.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Ānanda. should be checked<br />
					any remorse in Chunda the smith.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn80" href="#n80">80</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">43. Then the Exalted One, perceiving how the matter stood,<br />
					uttered on that occasion this hymn of exultation:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'To him who gives shall virtue be increased;<br />
							In him who curbs himself, no anger can arise;<br />
							The righteous man casts off all evil ways,<br />
							And by the rooting out of lust, and bitterness,<br />
							And all infatuation, is at peace!'</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">End of the Fourth Portion for Recitation,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a></p>

					<h3 class="ctr"><a id="ch5">Chapter V</a></h3>

					<p class="f4">1. Now the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come. Ānanda, let us go on to the Sāla Grove of the Mallas,<br />
					the Upavattana of Kusinārā,<br />
					on the further side of the river Hiranyavati.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />
					said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the brethren to the Sāla Grove of the Mallas, the Upavattana of Kusinārā,  on the further side of the river Hiranyavati:<br />
					and when he had come there he addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Spread over for me, I pray you, Ānanda,<br />
					the couch with its head to the north,<br />
					between the twin Sāla trees.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I am weary, Ānanda, and would lie down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />
					said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he spread a covering over the couch with its head to the north,<br />
					between the twin Sāla trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One laid himself down on his right side,<br />
					with one leg resting on the other;<br />
					and he was mindful and self-possessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time the twin Sāla trees were all one mass of bloom with flowers out of season;<br />
					and <a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> all over the body of the Tathāgata<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn82" href="#n82">82</a>]</sup></span> these dropped and sprinkled and scattered themselves,<br />
					out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">And heavenly Mandārava flowers, too,<br />
					and heavenly sandalwood powder came falling from the sky,<br />
					and all over the body of the Tathāgata they descended and sprinkled and scattered themselves,<br />
					out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">And heavenly music was sounded in the sky,<br />
					out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">And heavenly songs came wafted from the skies,<br />
					out of reverence for the successor of the Buddhas of old!</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The twin Sāla trees are all one mass of bloom with flowers out of season;<br />
					all over the body of the Tathāgata these drop and sprinkle and scatter themselves,<br />

					<p class="f4">And heavenly songs come wafted from the skies,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now it is not thus, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">18. 'Long ago, Ānanda, there was a king, by name Mahā-Sudassana,<br />

					<p class="f4">Both by day and by night, Ānanda, the royal city Kusāvati resounded with the ten cries;<br />

					<p class="f4">And after this manner the venerable Ānanda presented all the Mallas of Kusinārā to the Exalted One in the first watch of the night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the Wanderer Subhadda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet this day,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now a certain feeling of uncertainty has sprung up in my mind;<br />
					and this faith have I in the Samana Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">24. Then the Wanderer Subhadda went to the Sāla Grove of the Mallas,<br />
					to the Upayattana of Kusinārā,<br />
					to the place where the venerable Ānanda was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come there he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Trouble not the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One is weary.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Wanderer Subhadda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Trouble not the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One is weary.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time the Wanderer Subhadda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">25. Now the Exalted One overheard this conversation of the venerable Ānanda with the Wanderer Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One called the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is enough, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not keep out Subhadda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Subhadda, Ānanda, may be allowed to see the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever I may say in answer to his questions,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda said to Subhadda, the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter in, friend Subhadda;<br />
					for the Exalted One gives you leave.'</p>

					<p class="f4">26. Then Subhadda, the Wanderer, went in to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and saluted him courteously,<br />
					and after exchanging with him the compliments of esteem and of civility,<br />
					he took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was thus seated, Subhadda, the Wanderer, said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The leaders in religious life<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn102" href="#n102">102</a>]</sup></span> who are heads of companies of <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> disciples and students,<br />
					teachers of students,<br />

					Kakkāyana of the Pakudha tree,<br />
					Sañgaya the son of the Belaṭṭhi slave-girl,<br />

					have they all,<br />
					according to their own assertion,<br />
					thoroughly understood things?<br />
					or have they not?<br />
					or are there some of them who have understood,<br />
					and some who have not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, Subhadda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let this matter rest whether they,<br />
					according to their own assertion,<br />
					have thoroughly understood things,<br />
					or whether they have not,<br />
					or whether some of them have understood<br />
					and some have not!</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, Subhadda, will I teach you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen well to that,<br />
					and give ear attentively,<br />
					and I will speak!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />
					said the Wanderer Subhadda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">27. And the Exalted One spake:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda,<br />
					the Aryan eightfold path is not found,<br />
					neither in it is there found a man of true saintliness<br />
					of the first,<br />
					or of the second,<br />
					or of the third,<br />
					or of the fourth degree.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda,<br />
					the Aryan eightfold path is found,<br />
					in it is found the man of true saintliness of the first,<br />
					and the second,<br />
					and the third,<br />
					and the fourth degree.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn103" href="#n103">103</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now in this doctrine and discipline, Subhadda,<br />
					is found the Aryan eightfold path,<br />
					and in it <a id="pg167"><span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></a> too, are found, Subhadda, the men of true saintliness of all the four degrees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Void are the systems of other teachers -<br />
					void of true saints.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this one, Subhadda, may the brethren live the Life that's Right,<br />
					so that the world be not bereft of Arahants.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn104" href="#n104">104</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">But twenty-nine was I when I renounced<br />
							The world, Subhadda, seeking after Good.<br />
							For fifty years and one year more, Subhadda,<br />
							Since I went out, a pilgrim have I been<br />
							Through the wide realm of System and of Law ­<br />
							Outside of that no victory can be won!<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn105" href="#n105">105</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yea, not of the first,<br />

					nor of the third,<br />
					nor of the fourth degree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Void are the systems of other teachers -<br />
					void of true saints.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in this one, Subhadda,<br />
					may the brethren live the perfect life,<br />
					that the world be not bereft of Arahants.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> And when he had thus spoken, Subhadda, the Wanderer, said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent, lord, are the words of thy mouth,<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal that which is hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a lamp into the darkness,<br />
					so that those who have eyes can see external forms -<br />
					just even so, lord,<br />
					has the truth been made known to me,<br />
					in many a figure,<br />
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, even I, betake myself, lord,<br />
					to the Exalted One as my refuge,<br />
					to the Truth,<br />
					and to the Brotherhood.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would fain be accepted as a probationer under the Exalted One,<br />
					as a full member in his Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">29. 'Whosoever, Subhadda, has formerly been a follower of another doctrine,<br />
					and thereafter desires to be received into the higher or the lower grade in this doctrine and discipline,<br />
					he remains on probation for the space of four months;<br />
					and at the end of the four months,<br />
					the brethren, exalted in spirit,<br />
					receive him into the lower or into the higher grade of the order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless in this case I acknowledge the difference in persons.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, lord, whosoever has formerly been a follower of another doctrine,<br />
					and then desires to be received into the higher or the lower grade in this doctrine and discipline, -<br />
					if, in that case, such a person remains on probation for the space of four months;<br />
					and at the end of the four months,<br />
					the brethren, exalted in spirit,<br />
					receive him into the lower or into the higher grade of the Order -<br />
					I too, then, will remain on probation for the space of four months;<br />
					and at the end of the four months let the brethren,<br />
					exalted in spirit,<br />
					receive me into the lower or into the higher grade of the Order!'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One called the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As it is, Ānanda, receive Subhadda into the Order!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so. lord!'<br />
					said the venerable Ānanda, in assent, to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> And Subhadda, the Wanderer, said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Great is your gain, friend Ānanda,<br />
					great is your good fortune, friend Ānanda,<br />
					in that you all have been sprinkled with the sprinkling of discipleship in this brotherhood at the hands of the Master himself!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So Subhadda, the Wanderer, was received into the higher grade of the Order under the Exalted One;<br />
					and from immediately after his ordination the venerable Subhadda remained alone and separate,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					and resolved.</p>

					<p class="f4">And ere long he attained to that supreme goal of the higher life,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn106" href="#n106">106</a>]</sup></span> for the sake of which the clansmen go out from all and every household gain and comfort to become houseless wanderers -<br />
					yea, that supreme goal did he, by himself,<br />
					and while yet in this visible world,<br />
					bring himself to the knowledge of,<br />
					and continue to realize,<br />
					and to see face to face!</p>

					<p class="f4">And he became conscious that birth was at an end,<br />
					that the higher life had been fulfilled,<br />
					that all that should be done had been accomplished,<br />
					and that after this present life there would be no beyond!</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Subhadda became yet another among the Arahants;<br />

					<p class="f4">1. Now the Exalted One addressed the venerable Ānanda, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It may be, Ānanda, that in some of you the thought may arise,<br />
					"The word of the master is ended,<br />

					<p class="f4">4. 'When I am gone, Ānanda, let the higher penalty be imposed on brother Channa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what, lord, is the higher penalty?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let Channa say whatever he may like, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is because you, 0 Vāseṭṭhas, have one purpose,<br />

					<p class="f4">But the purpose of the spirits, Vāseṭṭhas, is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us carry the body of the Exalted One by the north<br />

					<p class="f4">And going out again by the eastern gate, ­<br />

					<p class="f4">21. Now just at that time four chieftains of the Mallas had bathed their heads and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pyre of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, behold, they were unable to set it alight!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Mallas of Kusinārā said to the venerable Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, lord, can be the reason,<br />
					and what the cause that four chieftains of the Mallas having bathed their heads and clad themselves in new garments with the intention of setting on fire the funeral pyre of the Exalted One<br />
					were unable to set it alight?</p>

					<p class="f4">The purpose of the spirits, 0 Vāseṭṭhas, is different.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what, sir. is the purpose of the spirits?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The purpose of the spirits, 0 Vāseṭṭhas, is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">That venerable brother Mahā Kassapa is now journeying along the way from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a great company of the brethren,<br />
					with five hundred brethren.</p>

					<p class="f4">The funeral pyre of the Exalted One shall not catch fire until the venerable Mahā Kassapa shall have been able reverently to salute the feet of the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even according to the purpose of the spirits so, sir, let it be!'</p>

					<p class="f4">22. Then the venerable Mahā Kassapa went on to Makuṭa-bandhana of Kusinārā, to the shrine of the Mallas,<br />
					to the place where the funeral pyre of the Exalted One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had come up to it he arranged his robe on one shoulder;<br />
					and after bowing down with clasped hands,<br />
					he thrice walked reverently round the pyre,<br />
					and then, uncovering the feet,<br />
					he bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those five hundred brethren arranged their robes on one shoulder;<br />
					and bowing down with clasped <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> hands,<br />
					they thrice walked reverently round the pyre,<br />
					and then bowed down in reverence at the feet of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the homage of the venerable Mahā Kassapa and of those five hundred brethren was ended,<br />
					the funeral pyre of the Exalted One caught fire of itself.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn127" href="#n127">127</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">23. Now as the body of the Exalted One burned itself away,<br />
					from the skin and the integument,<br />
					and the flesh,<br />
					and the nerves,<br />
					and the fluid of the joints,<br />
					neither soot nor ash was seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only the bones remained behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as one sees no soot or ash when ghee or oil is burned;<br />
					so, as the body of the Exalted One burned itself away,<br />
					from the skin and the integument,<br />
					and the flesh,<br />
					and the nerves,<br />

					neither soot nor ash was seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only the bones remained behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of those five hundred pieces of raiment the very innermost and outermost were both consumed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the body of the Exalted One had been burnt up,<br />
					there came down streams of water from the sky and extinguished the funeral pyre of the Exalted One;<br />
					and there burst forth streams of water from the storehouse of the waters<br />
					[beneath the earth],<br />
					and extinguished the funeral pyre of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Mallas of Kusinārā also brought water scented <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> with all kinds of perfumes,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he divided the remains of the Exalted One equally into eight parts,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in2" href="#ifn2">i2</a>]</sup> It does not quite follow that the Vinaya is borrowing direct from the Dīgha. That may be so. But the Subhadda story may have been in existence before either Dīgha or Vinaya was put into its present shape. If so, it was doubtless current in the form now preserved by the Dīgha; and was changed by the compilers of the Vinaya. Both Oldenberg <i>(loc. cit.)</i> and Franke <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1908_vi.pdf">(<i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1908, 8-12)</a> suppose the Vinaya to be borrowing from the Dīgha. It is quite possible that the two books - Dīgha and Vinaya - may have been put together, as we now have them, at the same time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in3" href="#ifn3">i3</a>]</sup> It is admitted there were no reporters present. There were at the time of the Buddha's death no mechanical means available for writing anything beyond the most meagre notes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Ajātasattu Vedehīputto. The first word is not a personal name but an official epithet, 'he against whom there has arisen no (worthy or equal) foe' (so already in the Rig Veda but Sum. I 31 different). The second gives us the maiden family, or tribal (not personal) name of his mother. Her name, according to a Tibetan authority quoted by Rockhill, 'Life of the Buddha,' p. 63, was Vāsavī.<br />
					Persons of distinction arc scarcely eyer mentioned by name in Indian Buddhist hooks, a rule applying more especially to kings, but extended not unfrequently to private persons. Thus Upatissa, the disciple whom the Buddha himself declared to be 'the second founder of the kingdom of righteousness,' is referred to either as Dhamma-senāpati or as Sāriputta; epithets of corresponding origin to those in the text. See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.06.rhyt.pts.htm#pg193">above, Vol. 1, pp. 193-5.</a><br />
					By the Jains Ajātasattu is called Kūṇika or Koṇika, which again is probably not the name given to him at the rice-eating (the ceremony corresponding to infant baptism), but a nickname acquired in after-life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Evam mahiddihike evam mahānubhāve.</i> There is nothing magical or supernatural about the <i>iddhi</i> here referred to. <i>Etena tesaṃ samagga-bhāvaṃ kathesi</i> says the commentator simply: thus referring the former adjective to the power of union, as he does the second to the power derived from practice in military tactics <i>(hatthisippādīhi).</i> See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.11.rhyt.pts.htm#pg273">above, Vol. I, p. 273.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The wording of §2 is here repeated. [Ed.: included in this version.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> In the text there is a question, answer, and reply with each clause.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Cetiyāni,</i> which Sum. VII. explains as <i>Yakkha-cetiyāni.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The commentator adds that this was a vihara erected on the site of a former shrine of the Yakkha Sārandada. The teaching referred to is set out in full at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p19"><i>A.</i> IV, 16,</a> but the persons taught are there called Licchavis.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> 'Overcome' is literally 'done' <i>(karaṇīya),</i> but the word evidently has a similar sense to that which 'done' occasionally has in colloquial English. <i>Upalāpana,</i> which I have only met with here, must mean 'humbug, cajolery, diplomacy;' see the use of the verb <i>upa-lāpeti,</i> at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.03.021-025.pali.bd.htm#pg102"><i>S.</i> I, 102;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vin.</i></a> II, I 19; IV, 139; <i>Jāt.</i> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_249">II, 266, 267;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_448">IV, 56.</a> Sum. VII. explains it, at some length, as making an alliance, by gifts, with hostile intent, which comes to much the same thing. The root, I think, is <i>lī.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The word translated 'brethren' throughout is in the original <i>bhikkhu,</i> a word most difficult to render adequately by any word which would not, to Christians and in Europe, connote something different from the Buddhist idea. A <i>bhikkhu,</i> literally 'beggar,' was a disciple who had joined Gotama's order; but the word refers to their renunciation of worldly things, rather than to their consequent mendicancy; and they did not really beg in our modern sense of the word. Hardy has 'priests;' I have elsewhere used 'monks' and sometimes 'beggars' and 'members of the order.' This last is, I think, the best rendering; but it is too long for constant repetition, as in this passage, and too complex to be a really good version of <i>bhikkhu.</i> The members of the order were not priests, for they had no priestly powers. They were not monks, for they took no vow of obedience, and could leave the order (and constantly did so and do so still) whenever they chose. They were not beggars, for they had none of the mental and moral qualities associated with that word. 'Brethren' connotes very much the position in which they stood to one another; but I wish there were a better word to use in rendering <i>bhikkhu.</i></p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>I'll blunder into this one. This is a misunderstanding. Wrong desire is to be eliminated, no question. But the Buddha teaches not only the elimination of wrong desire but also that of any desire whatsoever, including that for attaining Nibbāna. This is explained by the simile of desire to reach a goal. When the goal is attained, the desire is let go. So 'good' desire is both useful and to be abandoned by the seeker, but for the Arahant it is completely abandoned.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The blundering misstatement that Buddhism teaches the suppression of desire (not of wrong desire) is still occasionally met with. The question is fully discussed in Mrs. Rhys Davids's article on 'The Will in Buddhism' (<i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1898).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This is an interesting analogue to Philippians iii. I 3: - 'I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark,' etc. See also below, Chap. V, § 68.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The exact distinction between <i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i> is here explained by Buddhaghosa as loathing sin as contrasted with fear of sin. But this is rather a gloss than an exact and exclusive definition. <i>Ahirikā</i> is shamelessness, <i>anotappaṃ</i> frowardness. At <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_32"><i>Jāt.</i> I, 207</a> we find <i>hiri</i> described as subjective, and <i>ottappa</i> as objective, modesty of heart as contrasted with decency in outward behaviour. See further Mrs. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist Psychology,' p. 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa takes this in a spiritual sense. He says: - 'These virtues are <i>bhujissāni</i> because they bring one to the state of a free man by delivering him from the slavery of craving.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The commentator explains: - 'These virtues are called <i>aparāmaṭṭhāni</i> because they are untarnished by craving or delusion, and because no one can say of him who practises them, "you have been already guilty of such and such a fault." Craving is here the hope of a future life in heaven, and delusion the belief in the efficacy of rites and ceremonies (the two <i>nissayas</i>), which are condemned as unworthy inducements to virtue. At <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p105"><i>A.</i> III, 132</a> these five qualities are ca1led <i>phāsu-vihārā,</i> states of bliss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> This paragraph is spoken of as if it were a well-known summary, and it is constantly repeated below. The word I have here rendered 'earnest contemplation' is <i>samādhi,</i> which occupies in the Five <i>Nikāyas</i> very much the same position as faith does in the New Testament; and this section shows that the relative importance of <i>samādhi, paññā,</i> and <i>sīla</i> played a part in early Buddhism just as the distinction between faith, reason, and works did afterwards in Western theology. It would be difficult to find a passage in which the Buddhist view of the relation of these conflicting ideas is stated with greater beauty of thought, or equal succinctness of form. See further Rhys Davids's <i>'The Yogavacara's Manual of Indian Mysticism,'</i> pp. xxv foll., and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.04.rhyt.pts.htm#pg156">above, Vol. I, p. 156.</a> Also E.W.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Arahant Buddhas. The meaning of these words must have been very present to the minds of those who used them at the time of the rise of what we call Buddhism; and there was little or no difference between the connotation of the two terms. As time went on the two were more and more differentiated, and hardened into technical terms. See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p58"><i>Saṃyutta</i> III, 65</a> on the difference between the two: and see <i>Saṃyutta</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.11.001-025.pali.bd.htm#pg233">I, 233;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p107">III, 160;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p198">IV, 175</a> for very old explanations of <i>Arahā,</i> and <i>Paṭisambhidā</i> I, 172 for an ancient commentary on the meaning of Buddha.</p>

							<p>RD does not see that Sāriputta said this with the full comprehension that he was not saying 'wisest of all' but 'as wise as all'. And he was speaking only of Buddhas, not of teachers of other views. There is no distinction between Arahantship and Buddhahood in terms of 'freedom of mind.' The distinction between the <i>Sammāsambuddha</i> and the Arahant is that the <i>Sammāsambuddha</i> awakens himself without the help of another whereas the Arahant awakens himself with the aid of the Dhamma taught by the <i>Sammāsambuddha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The <i>tertium quid</i> of the comparison is the completeness of the knowledge. Sāriputta acknowledges that he was wrong in jumping to the wide conclusion that his 0wn lord and master was the wisest of all the teachers of the different religious systems that were known to him. So far-after the cross-examination by the Buddha - he admits that his knowledge does not reach. But he maintains that he does know that which is, to him, after all the main thing, namely, that all the Buddhas must have passed through the process here laid down as leading up to the Enlightenment of Arahantship.<br />
					All the details he gives are details, not of Buddhahood, but of Arahantship. He makes no distinction between the two states of attainment. This is most important for the history of that Buddhology, which, in after centuries, was the main factor in the downfall of Buddhism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> As will be observed from the similar passages that follow, there is a regular sequence of clauses in the set descriptions of the Buddha's movements. The last clause should specify the particular grove or house where the Exalted One stayed; but it is also (in this and one or two other cases) inserted with due regularity even when it adds nothing positive to the sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Compare below, <a href="#ch4">Chapter IV,</a> §§ 2, 3; <a href="#pg131">p. 131.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> At first Nādika is (twice) spoken of in the plural number (a clan name); but then, thirdly, in the last clause, in the singular (a local name derived from the clan-name). Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that there were two villages of the same name on the shore of the same piece of water. The 'Brick Hall' was the public resting­place for travellers, and the name is noteworthy as almost all buildings were then of wood.<br />
					The expression used here is an idiomatic phrase descriptive of the arrival of travellers at a place: - 'and there, at X. so and so stayed in Y.' where X. is the name of the town or village, and Y. is the lodging­place the traveller occupies. (See just above in § 1 for a good instance.) The first name, the name X., is always the name of the town, and never an adjective in agreement with the second name. It seems simple enough; but even the best Sanskritists appear sometimes to be unfamiliar with the force of this Pāli idiom.</p>

It is fully treated of in each of the Nikāyas, forming the subject of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">Mahā Satippaṭṭhāna Suttanta</a> in the Dīgha Nikāya, and the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">Satippaṭṭhāna Suttanta</a> of the Majjhima Nikāya, and the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm">Satippaṭṭhāna Saṃyutta</a> of the <i>Saṃyutta Nikāya,</i> as well as of various passages in the <i>Aṇguttara Nikāya,</i> and of the <i>Vibhaṇga.</i> See above, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#pg80">Vol. I, pp. 80, 81;</a> and the translation, below, of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">pp. 290 foll.</a> of the text. The point is there discussed in detail.<br />
					Buddhaghosa has no comment here on the subject itself, reserving what he has to say for the comment on the Suttantas devoted entirely to it; but he observes in passing that the reason why the Exalted One laid stress, at this particular time and place, on the necessity of being 'mindful and thoughtful,' was because of the imminent approach of the beautiful courtezan in whose grove they were staying. The use of the phrase <i>sati upaṭṭhāpetabbā</i> below, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.16.rhyt.pts.htm#pg154">Chap. V, 9 (text, p. 141),</a> in reference to the way in which women should be treated, is quite in accordance with this explanation. But see the next note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> From this point down to the words 'he rose from his seat,' in <a href="#ch2">II, 24</a> is, with a few unimportant variations, word for word the same as <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya,</i></a> Vol. I, pp. 231-3. But the passage there follows immediately after the verses translated above, I. 34, so that the events here (in §§ 14-18) localized at Vesāli, are there localized at Koṭigāma. Our section <a href="#ch5">II, 5</a> is then inserted between our sections <a href="#ch2">II,</a> 18 and II, 19; and our section II, 11 does not occur at all, the Exalted One only reaching Ambapāli's grove when he goes there (as in our section II, 19) to partake of the meal to which he had been invited. Buddha­ghosa passes over this apparent discrepancy in silence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Literally 'by this woman.' But I have tried to reproduce the evident word-play. <i>'Ambapāli'</i> means mango grower, one who looks after mangoes.</p>

Having, as above stated, broken every bond of darkness <i>(tama),</i> those bhikkhus of mine, Ānanda, will be at the very top, in the highest condition. They will be at the very top of whom? Those bhikkhus who are willing to learn, and those who exercise themselves in the four ways of being mindful and thoughtful, they shall be at the top of all (the rest).

The last words, 'but they must be anxious to learn,' seem to me to be an afterthought. It is only those who are thoroughly determined to work out their own salvation, without looking for safety to any one else, even to the Buddha himself, who will, whilst in the world, enter into and experience Nirvana. But, of course, let there be no mistake, merely to reject the vain baubles of the current superstitious beliefs is not enough.

My MS. of the <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i> and the Turnour MS. of the <i>Sumangala Vilāsinī</i> read <i>pari-v-uṭṭhita,</i> and either spelling is correct. The fact is that the 'y' or 'v' in such cases is even less than euphonic; it is an assistance not to the speaker, but merely to the writer. Thus in the Sinhalese <i>duwanawā,</i> 'to run,' the spoken word is <i>duanawā,</i> and the 'w' is written only to avoid the awkward use in the middle of a written word of the initial sign for the sound 'a'. That the speakers of Pili found no difficulty in pronouncing two vowels together is abundantly proved by numerous instances. The writers of Pāli, in those cases in which the second vowel begins a word, use without hesitation the initial sign; but in the middle of the word this would be so ungainly that they naturally prefer to insert a consonantal sign to <i>to carry the vowel sign.</i> The varying readings I have pointed out are a strong confirmation of the correctness of the pronunciation of modern native scholars (in this case <i>pari-uṭṭhita</i>); and we may the more readily adopt it as the question is not really one concerning the pronunciation of <i>Pāli,</i> but concerning the use which modern native copyists make of their own alphabet.

							<p>This sutta is in answer to no such thing. This is a viewpoint dependent on RD's own views. The doctrine would have been understood: The Body is not the Self of the Buddha. To prolong it's life beyond it's natural life-span would need to be done with an act which could only be done by way of desire or compassion. On his own the Buddha would let the body die naturally, it would take a request such as suggested to Ānanda for him to so work things that the body would live on past it's natural lifespan.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> The narrative is now interrupted by the insertion of paragraphs which at first sight seem to be quite out of place. But the connexion, or want of connexion, between them and the main story is very suggestive as to the way in which the Suttanta was put together. The whole chapter is an answer to a possible objection, either from out­siders or from weaker members of the fold, that if the Buddha were really so great why did he die at all. The suggested answer is that he could have lived on if he had so wished; but he did not wish because he had certain kinds of power and insight and self-mastery which prevented him from doing so. For the purpose of this answer these paragraphs, already in existence among the Suttas current in the community, and dealing with these powers, are here repeated without any such connecting argument as we should find under similar circumstances, in a modern (written) book of apologetics. The argument suggested by them follows exactly the same lines as that in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p6">Mahāli Suttanta,</a> translated in the former volume (Number VI of the 'Dialogues').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> <i>Devatā</i> is a fairy, god, genius, or angel. I am at a loss how to render this word without conveying an erroneous impression to those not familiar with ancient ideas, and specially with ancient Indian ideas, of the spirit world. It includes gods of all sorts; tree and river nymphs; the kindly fairies or ghosts who haunt houses (see my <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_birth-stories.pdf">'Buddhist Birth Stories,' Tale 40</a>); spirits in the ground (see above, I, 26); the angels who minister at the great renunciation, the temptation, and the death of the Buddha; the guardian angels who watch over men, and towns, and countries; and many other similar beings. 'Celestial beings' would be wholly inapplicable, for instance, to the creatures referred to in the curious passage above (I, 26). 'Super­human being' would be an inaccurate rendering; for all these light and airy shapes come below, and after, man in the Buddhist order of precedence. 'Spirit' being used of the soul inside the human body, and of the human soul after it has left the body, and figuratively of mental faculties - none of which are included under <i>devatā</i> - would suggest ideas inconsistent with that of the Pāli word. As there is therefore no appropriate general word I have chosen, for each passage where the expression occurs, the word used in English of the special class more particularly referred to in the passage of the text. Here all kinds of <i>devatās</i> being referred to, and there being no word in English for them all, I have ventured to put the word <i>devatā</i> into my version, and to trouble the reader with this note.</p>

							<p>Matthew 21 18-22: <i>"Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever." And presently the fig tree withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, "How soon is the fig tree withered away!" Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, 'Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea'; it shall be done. And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."</i><br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa here tells a long story how Saṇgharakkhita Sāmaṇera, the nephew of Nāga Thera, attained Arahantship on the day of his admission to the order; and at once proceeded to heaven, and standing on the pinnacle of the palace of the king of the gods, shook the whole place with his big toe; to the great consternation and annoyance of the exalted dwellers therein! There is no doubt a real truth in the idea that deep thought can shake the universe, and make the palaces of the gods to tremble, just as faith is said in Matthew xxi. 21 to be able to remove mountains, and cause them to be cast into the sea. But these figurative expressions have, in Buddhism, become a fruitful soil for the outgrowth of superstitions and misunderstandings. The train of early Buddhist speculation in this field has yet to be elucidated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> The Bodhisatta's voluntary incarnation is looked upon by the Buddhists as a great act of renunciation, and curious legends have gathered about it. One is that on the night when she conceived his mother dreamt that a white elephant entered her side. The account will be found at length in my <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_birth-stories.pdf"><i>'Buddhist Birth Stories'</i></a> (pp. 62-4), and the earthquake is there mentioned in terms identical with those in the text. As I have pointed out in 'Buddhism' (p. 184), the white elephant legend is one of those hallowed sun stories by which half­converted Indians strove to embellish the life-story of the Teacher whose followers they had become. In the <i>Lalita Vistara</i> (Calc. ed. p. 63) the entrance of the elephant into Māyā precedes the dream; but though the ignorant may have therefore accepted it as a fact, it is of course only a figure of speech - and I venture to think from the Indian standpoint, a beautiful figure of speech - to express the incarnation of divine mildness and majesty in a human form. The use of such a figure is not confined to India. In one of the Apocryphal Gospels, the Gospel according to the Hebrews, the incarnation of the divine gentleness and love is expressed by saying that a dove from heaven 'entered into' the human form.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Windisch, <i>'Māra und Buddha,'</i> p. 75, makes this number refer to the number of entrances, and quotes <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/iti/iti.pali.bd.htm#pg15"><i>Itivuttaka,</i> p. 15,</a> in support.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> I do not understand the connexion of ideas between this paragraph and the idea repeated with such tedious iteration in the preceding paragraphs. The two seem to be in marked contrast, if not in absolute contradiction. Perhaps we have here the older tradition; and certainly this paragraph is more in accordance with the general impression of the character, and with the other sayings, of Gotama as handed down in the Pāli Piṭakas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> It is of great interest to notice what are the points upon which Gotama, in this last address to his disciples, and at the solemn time, when death was so near at hand, is reported to have lain such emphatic stress. Unfortunately we have only a fragment of the address, and, as it would seem from its commencement, only the closing fragment. This, however, is in the form of a summary, consisting of an enumeration of certain aggregates, the details of which must have been as familiar to the early Buddhists as the details of similar numerical terms-such as the ten commandments, the twelve tribes, the seven deadly sins, the four gospels, and so on - afterwards were to the Christians. This summary of the Buddha's last address may fairly be taken as a summary of Buddhism, which thus appears to be simply a system of earnest self-culture and self-control.<br />
					The following are the details of the aggregate technical terms used in the above summary, but it will be understood that the English equivalents used give rather a general than an exact representation of the ideas expressed by the Pāli ones. To attempt more would demand a treatise rather than a note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The four Earnest Meditations are:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. Meditation on the body.<br />
					2. Meditation on the sensations.<br />
					3. Meditation on the ideas.<br />
					4. Meditation on reason and character.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The. fourfold Great Struggle against evil is divided into:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. The struggle to prevent evil arising.<br />
					2. The struggle to put away evil states which have arisen.<br />
					3. The struggle to produce goodness not previously existing.<br />
					4. The struggle to increase goodness when it does exist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The four Roads to Saintship are four means by which <i>Iddhi</i> (see above, § 3, note) is to be acquired. They are:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. The will to acquire it united to earnest meditation and the struggle against evil.<br />
					2. The necessary exertion united to earnest meditation and the struggle against evil.<br />
					3. The necessary preparation of the heart united to earnest medita­tion and the struggle against evil.<br />
					4. Investigation united to earnest meditation and the struggle against evil.</p>

							<p>The difference between the <i>balāni</i> and the <i>indriyāni</i> is that the former is subjective power as perceived and used by the individual where the latter are objective forces.

					<p class="lgqt">The five moral powers (<i>balāni</i>) are said to be the same as the next class, called organs (<i>indriyāni</i>). It is no doubt most remarkable that, in a summary like this, two classes out of seven should be absolutely identical except in name. The difference of name is altogether too unimportant to account, by itself, for the distinction made. Either the currently accepted explanation of one of the two aggregate terms must be incorrect, or we must look for some explanation of the repetition other than the mere desire to record the double title. Is it impossible that the one class was split into two to bring the number of the classes up to the sacred number seven, corresponding to the seven Ratanas of a Cakkavatti?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The details of both classes are:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">1. Faith.<br />

Dr. Hoey informs me that the peasantry in these districts are still very fond of a bulbous root, a sort of truffle, found in the jungle, and called <i>sūkara-kanda.</i> Mr. K.E. Neumann, in his translation of the <i>Majjhima</i> (1896), p. xx, has collected several similar instances of truffle-like roots, or edible plants, having such names. The Sinhalese translation of the <i>Dīgha</i> (London and Colombo, 1905), p. 796, simply repeats the Pāli word. Buddhists do not attach much importance to the point. They have been mostly vegetarians, and are increasingly so. But their scheme of ethics works from within; and the Buddha expressly refused, in the case of Devadatta's schism, to lay down any hard and fast rule as to abstinence from flesh as food. It is perhaps of importance that the food prepared by Chunda and eaten by the Buddha is called <i>Bhatta</i> (below, § 21): this is not used elsewhere of meat.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> 'It should be understood,' says Buddhaghosa, 'that these are verses by the Theras who held the council.' And he repeats this at §§ 38, 41. These here seem to be two different versifications of the same legend.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> This is a most unusual way of speaking of the Buddha. In the Suttantas believers are represented as addressing him as <i>bhante,</i> lord or sir (the same form as that used by junior members of the Order in addressing their seniors); and as speaking of him by the epithet Bhagavā the Exalted One. Unbelievers address him as <i>bho Gotama,</i> and speak of him as the Samaṇa Gotama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> The Pukkusas were one of the despised tribes. Compare <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg152"><i>M.</i> II, 152;</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p85"><i>A.</i> II, 85;</a> <i>PP.</i> IV, 19; <i>Jāt.</i> IV, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_474">205,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_488">306;</a> <i>Lalita Vistara</i> XXI, 17. But Buddhaghosa says Pukkusa must here be simply a name, as the Mallas were Khattiyas. He adds that this Pukkusa was the owner of the five hundred carts that had just passed by; and that Aḷāra Kālāma was called Aḷāra because he was Dīgha-pingalo, Kālāma being his family name.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> This is a stock phrase constituting the final answer of a hitherto unconverted man at the end of one of those argumentative dialogues by which Gotama overcame opposition or expounded the truth. After a discussion of exalted themes it fits in very appropriately; here and elsewhere it is incongruous and strained. See below, V, 50.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> To understand what is here represented to have happened one must understand the mode in which the Buddhist Wanderers wore their robes. There was no tailoring at all. The set of three robes was simply three lengths of cotton cloth about a yard wide. One piece, folded in half, was wrapped round the body. Another piece covered the limbs from the waist to the ankles. It was supported by a girdle and went three or four times round. The third piece was put on over this last, went twice round the legs) and then the rest of it was thrown over the left shoulder, and passed under the right arm across the body. See below, ch. V, § 19.<br />
					Pukkusa had placed the two lengths of cloth, shawl-wise, over the shoulders of the recipients. When he left them Ānanda assisted the Buddha to put them on as Nos. 1 and 3 of a set of robes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> We have here the commencement of the legend which afterwards grew into an account of an actual 'transfiguration' of the Buddha. It is very curious that it should have taken place soon after the Buddha had announced to Ānanda his approaching death, and that in the Buddhist Sutta it should be connected so closely with that event; for a similar remark applies also to the Transfiguration mentioned in the Gospels.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> Here, and <a href="#pg137">above pp. 137-9,</a> we have spelt the name of the smith, in English, as it is pronounced in Pāli, and should be pronounced in English.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> According to the commentator 'tradition says that there was a row of Sāla trees at the head <i>(sīsa)</i> of that couch, and another at its foot, one young Sāla tree being close to its head, and another close to its foot. The twin Sāla trees were so called because the two trees were equally grown in respect of the roots, trunks, branches, and leaves. There was a couch there in the park for the special use of the (periodically elected) chieftin of the Mallas, and it was this couch which the Exalted One asked Ānanda to make ready.'<br />
					There is no further explanation of the term <i>uttara-sīsakaṃ,</i> which may have been the name for a slab of wood or stone reserved on great occasions for the use of the leaders of the neighbouring republic, but available at other times for passers-by.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> We have here the unusual case of the Buddha being called Tathāgata, not by himself, but by a third person, the compiler of the Suttanta. The paragraph is perhaps moulded by inadvertence on the next one. But see § 10. Compare the note above on <a href="#n75">IV, 25.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains that even twenty to sixty angels or gods <i>(devatāyo)</i> could stand <i>āragga-koṭi-nittūdana-</i> (MS. <i>nittaddana-</i>) <i>matte pi,</i> 'on a point pricked by the extreme point of a gimlet,' without inconveniencing one another <i>(aññam aññam avyābādhenti).</i> It is most curious to find this exact analogy to the notorious discussion as to how many angels could stand on the point of a needle in a commentary written at just that period of Buddhist history which corresponds to the Middle Ages of Christendom. The passage in the text does not really imply or suggest any such doctrine, though the whole episode is so absurd that the author of the text could not have hesitated to say so, had such an idea been the common belief of the early Buddhists. With these sections should be compared the similar sections in <a href="#ch6">Chapter VI,</a> of which these are perhaps merely an echo.<br />
					There is no comment on <i>nittūdana,</i> but there can be little doubt that Childers's conjectural reading is correct.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> It is literally, 'the Eye in the world will vanish away,' where Eye is of course used figuratively of that by the aid of which spiritual truths can be perceived, corresponding exactly to the similar use in Europe of the word Light. The Master is often called 'He with the Eye,' 'He of the Spiritual Eye' (see, for instance, the last verses in this Book), and here by a bold figure of speech he is called the Eye itself, which was shortly about to vanish away from the world, the means of spiritual insight which was no longer to be available for the common use of all men. But this is, it will be noticed, only the lament of the foolish and ignorant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> The words in brackets have been inserted from par. III, 48 above. See par. <a href="#ch6">VI,</a> 19 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> This conversation occurs also below (<a href="#ch6">VI,</a> 17), and the older tradition probably had it only in that connexion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> King of kings is an adequate rendering of the 'King of the Rolling Wheel,' the wheels of whose chariot roll unhindered through the land; that is to say, a king whose power no other king can dispute, who is an acknowledged overlord. The idea, which is explained very fully in the next Suttanta, may have arisen with the rise of the Kosala power; but it may also be later. If we could trace its history it would afford us a guide to the date at which the Mahā Parinibbāna Suttanta assumed its present form.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains this passage thus: - 'As Benares cloth, by reason of its fineness of texture, does not take the oil, he therefore says: - "with <i>vihata</i> cotton wool," that is, with cotton wool that has been well forced asunder.' The technical use of the word, as applied to cotton wool, has only been found in this passage. It usually means 'torn' with grief.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> <i>Ayasāya tela-doṇiyā,</i> where one would expect <i>āyasāya,</i> but my MS. of the <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i> confirms twice over here, and twice again below (<a href="#ch6">VI,</a> 33, 35) the reading given by Childers. Buddhaghosa says the word here means gold. <i>Ayas</i> was originally used for bronze, and only later for iron also, and at last exclusively of iron. As <i>kaṃsa</i> is already a common word for bronze in very early Buddhist Pāli texts. I think <i>āyasa</i> (not <i>ayasa</i>) would here mean 'of iron.' When Buddha­ghosa says it is here a name for gold, we can only conclude that iron had become, in his time, a metal which he might fairly consider too base for the purpose proposed. The whole process as described is not very intelligible; and one might suppose that <i>ayasa</i> after all had nothing to do with any metal, and was a technical term descriptive of some particular size or shape or colour of oil vessel. But it is frequently found in the MSS. when iron is clearly meant. Thus in the popular verse at <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_03_kosalasamyutta.htm#p11"><i>Saṃyutta</i> I, 77</a> on which a <i>Jātaka</i> is based <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_201">(II, 140),</a> which is inserted in the 'Anthologies' (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/dhp/kd.dhp.pali.bd.htm#v345"><i>Dhammapada</i> 345,</a> <i>Khar.</i> MS. No. 102), and twice quoted in the <i>Netti</i> (35, 153), the MSS. have both forms in spite of the metre favouring the long vowel. In this passage both Paññānanda's Colombo edition of 1877, and Samarasekara's version (Col. and Lond. 1905) have the short vowel only.</p>

Buddhaghosa attempts to explain away the discrepancy by saying that Vihara here means <i>Maṇḍala</i>. As the spot was the place for the performance of the communal ceremonies of the clan there was most likely a <i>Maṇḍala</i> there, and there must, from the context below, § 25), have been also some small closed-in building, a hut or cottage.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> With reference to Childers's note in his Dictionary on <i>mahāsālā,</i> with which every one must entirely agree, Buddhaghosa's explanation of the word will be interesting as a proof (if proof be needed) that the Ceylon scholars are not always trustworthy.

The Wanderers when at their lodging places on their travels lived (naturally in that beautiful climate) in undress-with only one robe on, the one from the waist to the feet. When they set out for the village on a visit, or on any ceremonious occasion, they put on the second robe, and (just as a European often carries his great-coat on his arm) carried the third with them. At some convenient spot near the village they would put this also on, and enter - so to speak - in full canonicals. And the bowl belonged to, formed part of, their official costume.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> <i>Samaṇa-brāhmaṇa,</i> which compound may possibly mean Samanas and Brāhmanas as it has usually been rendered, but I think not necessarily. Not one of those here specified were brahmins by birth, as is apparent from the Sumangala Vilāsinī on the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2"><i>Sāmañña­Phala Suttanta,</i></a> §§ 3-7. Compare the use of <i>Kshatriya-brahmano,</i> a soldier priest,' a Kshatriya who offered sacrifice; and of Brahmano, absolutely, as an epithet of an Arahant. In the use of the word <i>samaṇa</i> there seems to me to be a hopeless confusion between, a complete mingling of the meanings of, the two roots <i>√ram</i> and <i>√am</i> (which, in Pāli, would both become <i>sam</i>). It connotes both asceticism and inward peace, and might best be rendered 'devotee,' were it not for the intellectual inferiority implied by that word in our language. A <i>Samaṇa-brahmin</i> should therefore mean a man of any birth, who by his saintliness of life, by his renunciation of the world, and by his reputation as a religious thinker, had acquired the position of a quasi­brahmin and was looked up to by the people with as much respect as they looked up to a brahmin by birth.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> Arahants are those who have reached Nirvana, the 'supreme goal, the highest fruit' of <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/atthangika_magga.htm">the Aryan Eightfold Path.</a> To live 'the Life that's Right' <i>(sammā)</i> is to live in the Noble Path, each of the eight divisions of which is to be <i>sammā,</i> round, right and perfect, normal and complete. To live right <i>(sammā)</i> is therefore to have:­ (1) Right views, free from superstition; (2) right aims, high and worthy of the intelligent and earnest man; (3) right speech, kindly, open, truthful; (4) right conduct, in all concerns of life; (5) right livelihood, bringing hurt or danger to no living thing; (6) right perseverance, in all the other seven; (7) right mindfulness, the watchful, active mind; (8) right contemplation, earnest thought on the deep mysteries of life. In each of these the word right is <i>sammā,</i> and the whole paragraph being on the Aryan Path, the allusion is certainly to this central doctrine of the Buddhist Dhamma.<br />
					Buddhaghosa says that <i>bhikkhu sammā viharati,</i> who, having himself entered the Aryan Path, leads his brother into it, and this is, no doubt, good Buddhism. But it is a practical application of the text, a theological exegesis, and not a philological explanation. Even so it seems to lay the stress too much on 'bereft,' and too little on 'Arahants.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> Literally 'There is no <i>samaṇa.'</i> See note on <a href="#n102">§ 26.</a> I have followed, though with some doubt, Childers's punctuation.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that the last five words in the text (the last twelve words in my translation) were added by the Theras who held the Council. On Subhadda's ordination he has the following interesting note: - 'The Thera (that is, Ānanda), they say, took him on one side, poured water over his head from a water vessel, made him repeat the formula of meditation on the impermanency of the body (see my <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_birth-stories.pdf"><i>'Buddhist Birth Stories,'</i></a> p. 161), shaved off his hair and beard, clad him in the yellow robes, made him repeat the "Three Refuges," and led him back to the Exalted One. The Exalted One himself admitted him then into the higher rank of the brotherhood, and pointed out to him a subject for meditation <i>(kamma-ṭ-ṭhāna)</i>. He accepted this. and walking up and down in a quiet part of the grove, he thought and meditated upon it, till overcoming the Evil Spirit, he had acquired Arahantship, and with it the discriminating knowledge of all the Scriptures <i>(Paṭisambhidā).</i> Then, returning, he came and took his seat beside the Exalted One.'<br />
					According to this, no set ceremony for ordination <i>(Saṇgha­kammaṃ),</i> as laid down in the Vinaya, took place; and it is otherwise probable that no such ceremony was usual in the earliest days of Buddhism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> These nine states are called in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/miln/idx_milinda.htm"><i>Milinda,</i></a> p. 176, the nine Anupubba-Vihāras. We have therefore, in this list, a technical, scholastic, attempt to describe the series of ideas involved in what was considered the highest thought. No one, of course, can have known what actually did occur; and the eight boundary lines between the nine states are purely conjectural.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> Brahmā, the first cause, the highest result of Indian theological speculation, the one God of the Indian Pantheists, is represented as using expressions full of deep allusions to the most characteristic Buddhist doctrines. The <i>Samussaya</i> is the result of the temporary collocation of the 'aggregations' <i>(khandha)</i> of mental and material qualities which give to each being (<i>bhūto,</i> that is, man, animal, god, ghost, fairy, or what not) its outward and visible shape, its individuality. <i>Loka</i> is here not the world in our sense, but the 'locality' in the Buddhist universe which such an individual occupies until it is dissolved. (Comp. Chap. II, §§ 12, 26.) Brahmā appears therefore as a veritable Doctor in theology, and I have been obliged to expand the translation to bring out all the meaning in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> On this celebrated verse see below the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.17.rhyt.pts.htm#pg192">Introduction to Mahā­Sudassana-Suttanta.</a> It must be the original of the first verse in the Chinese work, <i>Fa Kheu Pi Hu</i> (<a href="../../../resources/pdf/beal/beal.dhammapada.pdf">Beal, <i>Dhammapada,</i></a> p. 32), though it is there so changed that every clause has lost its point.</p>

					      <p class="in4">Whatever exists is without endurance,<br />
							And hence the terms 'flourishing' and 'decaying.'<br />
							A man is born, and then he dies.<br />
							Oh, the happiness of escaping from this condition!'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The very meaning which is here the most essential connotation of <i>saṅkhāra</i> is lost in the phrase 'whatever exists.' By a misapprehension of the, no doubt, difficult word <i>Dhamma,</i> which, however, never means 'term,' the second clause has lost its point. And by a grammatical blunder the third clause in the Chinese confines the doctrine, erroneously, to man. In a Chinese tale, called <i>Ngan shih niu,</i> translated by Mr. Beal, in the <i>'Indian Antiquary'</i> for May, 1880, the following verses occur; and they are possibly another reflection of this stanza:</p>

					      <p class="in4">'All things that exist are transitory,<br />
							They must of necessity perish and disappear;<br />
							Though joined together, there must be separation;<br />
							Where there is life there must be death.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Compare the constantly repeated phrase: - 'Whatsoever hath an origin, in that is inherent the necessity of dissolution.' The perception of this is emphatically called the Eye for the Truth; and the doctrine is referred to in the next section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> In these four stanzas we seem to have the way in which the death of the Buddha would be regarded, as the early Buddhist thought, by four representative persons - the exalted God of the theologians; the Jupiter of the multitude (allowing in the case of each of these for the change in character resulting from their conversion to Buddhism); the holy, thoughtful Arahant; and the loving, childlike disciple.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> Nearly = <a href="#ch5">V,</a> § 6; and below, <a href="#ch6">VI,</a> 19.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> <i>Ugghāyanti.</i> I have followed the reading of my own MS., which is confirmed by the <i>Sumangala Vilāsinī</i> and the <i>Mālālaṇkara­vatthu. Vigghāyanti,</i> which Childers reads, would be questionable Buddhism. The spirits do not become extinct; that is, not as a general rule, as would be implied by the absolute statement: - 'Even the spirits, brethren, become extinct.' It is no doubt true that all spirits, from the lowest to the highest, from the most insignificant fairy to the God of theological speculation, are regarded as temporary. But when they cease to exist as gods or spirits <i>(devatā),</i> they do not go out, they are not extinguished <i>(vigghāayanti);</i> they continue to exist in some other form. And though that other form would, from the European point of view, be a different being, as there would be no continuity of consciousness, no passage of a 'soul' from the one to the other; it would, from the Buddhist point of view, be the same being, as it would be the resultant effect of the same Karma. There would follow on the death of a <i>devatā,</i> not extinction, but a transmutation of force, a transmigration of character, a passing on, an inheritance of Karma. Only in the exceedingly rare case of an <i>anāgāmin,</i> of which an instance will be found above <a href="#ch2">Chap. II,</a> § 7, could it be said that a spirit becomes extinct.<br />
					The expression 'of worldly mind,' here and above in <a href="#ch5">V,</a> 6, is in Pāli <i>paṭhavi-saññiniyo,</i> an ambiguous phrase which has only as yet been found in this connexion. The word is here opposed to <i>vītarāga,</i> 'free from passion,' and I have therefore taken it in a spiritual sense. There is another possibility, <i>viz.</i> that it is used in an intellectual sense, 'making the idea of earth present to their mind'; and this would be in accordance with the use of <i>saññi</i> in the <i>Kasiṇa</i> meditations, in which spirits, like men, were supposed to indulge; see <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.16.pali.bd.htm#pg108"><i>Dīgha</i> II, 108.</a> But how easily, especially in Buddhism, the intellectual merges into the religious may be seen from such a <i>Kasiṇa</i> phrase as <i>maraṇa-saññino,</i> used at <i>Mahāvaṃsa</i> V, 159, of good men.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> The dress of the Mallas consisted probably of mere lengths of muslin or cotton cloth; and a suit of apparel consisted of two or, at the outside, of three of these - one to wrap around the loins, one to throw over the shoulders, and one to use as a turban. To make a canopy on occasions of state they would join such pieces together; to make the canopy into a tent they would simply add walls of the same material; and the only decoration, as simple as it is beautiful, would be wreaths of flowers, or single lotuses, hanging from the roof, or stretched along the sides. Every civil servant travelling on duty in remote districts in Ceylon has such a tent or canopy put up for him by the peasantry.</p>

							<p>One can see that the issue is respect versus superstition. Precisely how this worked is speculation on my part, but I propose that to take the body, keeping it outside the village, to the South of the village, where executions took place and the charnal ground lay would be disrespectful. The respectful thing was to exit via the East gate, towards the rising sun. To exit the East gate the village would need to be entered. To enter via the south gate would provoke superstitions (rise of the dead, allowing in spirits of the dead, etc.), as possibly would entering by way of the West gate (the setting sun, possibly just psychologically depressing), therefore they chose the North gate.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> The point of this interesting legend is that that the inhabitants of an lndian village of that time would have considered it a desecration or pollution to bring a dead body into or through their village. Authorities differ as to the direction in which it should be taken to avoid this. The old custom, according to Caland (p. 23) was to take it to the East or the West. Later priestly books (Manu, for instance, V, 92) say to the North. The Mallas wanted to go to the South. The remedy proposed by the spirits who are shocked at this impropriety, is more shocking still.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> At p. xxvi of the Introduction to his edition of the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm">Vinaya,</a> Prof. Oldenberg identifies this Subhdda with Subhadda the last convert, mentioned above at the end of Chap. V. They are different persons; the last convert being represented as a man of high character, incapable of the conduct here ascribed to this Subhadda. The last convert was a brahmin, traditionally supposed to be younger brother to <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/annakondanna.htm"><i>Aññā Kondañña,</i></a> the first convert; this Subhadda had been a barber in the village Ātumā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> It is possible that we have here the survival of some ancient custom. Spence Hardy appropriately refers to a ceremony among Jews (of what place or time is not mentioned) in the following terms: ­ 'Just before a Jew is taken out of the house to be buried, the relatives and acquaintances of the departed stand round the coffin; when the feet are uncovered; and each in rotation lays hold of the great toes, and begs pardon for any offence given to the deceased, and requests a favourable mention of them in the next world' (<a href="../../../resources/pdf/hardy/hardy-manual-budhism.pdf"><i>'Manual of Buddhism,'</i></a> p. 348).<br />
					The Buddhist bhikkhus in Siam and the great majority of those in Ceylon (the adherents of the <i>Siyam-samāgama</i>) always keep one shoulder uncovered. It is evident that the bhikkhus in Burma and those in Ceylon, who belong to the <i>Amara-pura-samāgama,</i> arc more in accordance with ancient custom in wearing the robe ordinarily over both shoulders.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> There is something very quaint in the way in which the faithful Mallas are here represented as bringing coals to Newcastle. The 'storehouse of the waters' is in Pāli <i>udaka-sālā,</i> on which Buddhaghosa has two theories: first, that the Sāla trees around shed down a miraculous rain from their trunks and branches and leaves; and next, that the waters burst up from the earth and became as it were a diadem of crystal round the pyre. On the belief that water thus burst up miraculously through the earth, see <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_birth-stories.pdf"><i>'Buddhist Birth Stories,'</i></a> pp. 64, 67. If the reading be correct it is scarcely possible that <i>sālā</i> can here have anything to do with Sāla trees; but the other interpretation is open to the objections that <i>sālā</i> means an open hall rather than a storehouse, and that the belief in a 'storehouse of water' has not, as yet, been found elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> Here again the commentator expands and adds to the comparatively simple version of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> Here closes Buddhaghosa's long and edifying commentary. He has no note on the following Verses, which he says were added by Theras in Ceylon. The additional verse found in the Phayre MS. was in the same way probably added in Burma.</p>
