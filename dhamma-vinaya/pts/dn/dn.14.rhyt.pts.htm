					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Mahā Padāna Sutta</b></h4>

					<p>We find in this tract the root of that Bira<i>n</i>a-weed which, growing up along with the rest of Buddhism, went on spreading so luxuriantly that it gradually covered up much that was of value in the earlier teaching, and finally led to the down-fall, in its home in India, of the ancient faith. The doctrine of the Bodhisatta, of the Wisdom-Being, drove out the doctrine of the Aryan Path. A gorgeous hierarchy of mythological wonder-workers filled men's minds, and the older system of self-training and self-control became forgotten.</p>

					<p>Even at its first appearance here the weed is not attractive. The craving for edification is more manifest in it than the desire for truth. We have legends of six forerunners of the historical Buddha, each constructed with wearisome iteration, in imitation of the then accepted beliefs as to the life of Gotama. So exactly do these six legends follow one pattern that it has been possible, without the omission of any detail, to arrange them in parallel columns.</p>

					<p>The main motive of this parallelism is revealed in the constantly repeated refrain <i>Ayam ettha dhammatā:</i> 'That, in such a case, is the rule,' the Norm, the natural order of things, according to the reign of law in the moral and physical world. Precisely the same idea is emphasized in the doctrine of dependent origination, the <i>Paṭcca-samuppāda,</i> placed here in the mouth of Vipassi, the most ancient of these six teachers of old. The fact that it is so placed shows that the early
					Buddhists, when our Suttanta was composed, believed this doctrine to have been pre-Buddhistic.</p>

					<p>It is probable that all the great religious teachers of antiquity appealed, in support of their views, to the wise men of still older times. It is so recorded of most of them; and where it is not recorded, as in the cases of Lao Tsü and Zarathustra, that is probably due to the meagreness of the extant records. In every country where the level of intelligence was sufficient to produce a great leader of men in matters of religion, it was sufficient also to bear in remembrance the names at least, and a vague notion as to some of the doctrines, of former, if perhaps less successful and famous, reformers.</p>

					<p><a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> But a Wisdom-Being, appearing from aeon to aeon under similar circumstances to propound a similar faith! This is an exclusively Indian conception; in Indian literature it is mainly Buddhist; and in Buddhist literature its first appearance is in documents of the date of our Suttanta. Did the Buddha himself know anything of this theory? Possibly not. The theory of a number of successive Buddhas pre-supposes the conception of a Buddha as a different and more exalted personage than an Arahant. Now in our oldest documents these two conceptions are still in a state of fusion. The word Buddha does not occur in its later, special, technical sense. It occurs often enough in ambiguous phrases, where it may be translated by 'Converted One, Awakened One.' Thus at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v408">Sutta Nipāta 48</a> [sic. vs 408, #III.1] it is said, of Gotama, 'The Awakened One (<i>Buddho</i>) came to Rājagaha'; but the time referred to is some years before he had become a Buddha in the later technical sense. And at Sutta <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v167">Nipāta 167</a> it is said: 'Let us ask Gotama, the awakened one who has passed beyond anger and fear'; but the very same adjectives are used at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/kd/iti/iti.3.than.ati.htm#p68">Itivuttaka, No. 68,</a> of any ordinary Arahant. So the phrases used to describe the mental crises in Gotama's career are invariably precisely the same as those used under similar circumstances of his disciples; and this holds good both of his going forth, and of his victory and attainment of Nirvana under the Tree of Wisdom. Further than that, in long descriptions of Gotama — such for instance as that in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#IV.3">Sutta Nipāta, verses 153 to 167</a> — all the epithets used are found elsewhere applied to one or other of his disciples. The teacher never called himself a Buddha (as distinct from an Arahant). When addressed as Buddha, or spoken of as such, by his followers, it is always doubtful whether anything more is meant than an enlightened Arahant.</p>

					<p>It is needless to state that this does not in the least imply any sense of equality between the teacher and his disciples. The very oldest documents represent the difference as immeasurable; but as a difference of degree, not of kind. The question is as to the manner of the growth and hardening of this sense of difference; and as to the consequent gradual change in the connotation of words.</p>

					<p>In the episode of the events between the Wisdom Tree and the First Discourse, in which — for the first time perhaps — we twice have the epithet Sammāsambuddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, it is in a similar way associated both times on equal terms with Arahā. So <a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> the word Bodhisatta has gradually changed its meaning and implication. First used of Gotama between the Going Forth and the Nirvana, it is then used of him from the moment of conception; then of all the Buddhas from conception to Arahantship; then of those beings on earth — men or animals — who were eventually to become Buddhas; then of gods; and finally it became a sort of degree in theology, and was used as a term of respect for any learned and able Mahāyānist doctor.</p>

					<p>The word Apadāna, used in the title of this Suttanta for the legend or life-story of a Buddha, is also used as a title of a book in the supplementary Nikāya. There it has come generally to mean the legend or life-story of an Arahant, male or female, though the older connotation is also found. In later books it is never used, I think, for the legend of a Buddha. The full title may mean the Story of the Great Ones — that is the Seven Buddhas — or the Great (the important) Story — that is the Story of the Dhamma, and its bearers and promulgators. The last is probably what is meant, as in the corresponding title of the Mahāvastu.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Bandhuman the rāja, brethren,<br />
					let the brahmin soothsayers be invested with new robes<br />
					and gratified their every desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">34. And Bandhuman the rāja, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">36. And when the boy Vipassi was born, brethren,<br />

					by the which verily he could see<br />

					<p class="f4">37. And when the boy Vipassi was born, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now it was because of this,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then at the thought<br />
					"It is the babe who is judging cases aright"<br />
					ever more and more did that word<br />
					"a Seer, a Seer"<br />
					become used as his name.</p>

					<p class="f4">38. Now Bandhuman rāja, brethren,<br />
					had three palaces built for the boy Vipassi,<br />
					one for the rains,<br />
					one for the winter<br />
					and one for the summer,<br />
					and he had them fitted<br />
					with every kind of gratification<br />
					for the five senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it came to pass that Vipassi spent <a id="pg18"><span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span></a> the four months of the rainy season in the rains-palace,<br />
					ministered to by bands of female musicians;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">And seeing them he asked his charioteer: —</p>

					<p class="f4">11. Thereupon Bandhuman rāja, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">We must not have him going forth from the House into the Homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">We must not let what the brahmin soothsayers spoke of come true."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, that these things might not come to pass, he let the youth be still more surrounded by sensuous pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus Vipassi continued to live amidst the pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> 14. Now the young lord Vipassi, brethren,<br />

					saying: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Get ready the carriages, good charioteer,<br />
					and let us go through the park<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yea, my lord,"<br />
					replied the charioteer,<br />
					and harnessed the state carriages<br />
					and sent word to Vipassi: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"The carriages are ready, my lord;<br />
					do now what you deem to be fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vipassi mounted a state carriage,<br />
					and drove out in state<br />
					into the park.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Now the young lord Vipassi saw, brethren,<br />
					as he was driving to the park,<br />
					a shaven-headed man,<br />
					a Wanderer,<br />
					wearing the yellow robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seeing him<br />
					he asked the charioteer: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"That man, good charioteer,<br />
					what has he done,<br />
					that his head is unlike other men's heads<br />
					and his clothes too<br />
					are unlike those of others?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is what they call a Wanderer,<br />
					because, my lord,<br />
					he is one who has gone forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is that,<br />
					to have gone forth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"To have gone forth, my lord,<br />
					means being thorough in the religious life,<br />
					thorough in the peaceful life,<br />
					thorough in good actions,<br />
					thorough in meritorious conduct,<br />
					thorough in harmlessness,<br />
					thorough in kindness to all creatures."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent then, friend charioteer,<br />
					is what they call a Wanderer,<br />
					since excellent indeed, friend charioteer,<br />
					is being thorough in the religious life,<br />
					thorough in the peaceful life,<br />
					thorough in good actions,<br />
					thorough in meritorious conduct,<br />
					thorough in harmlessness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherefore drive up to that forth-gone man."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, my lord,"<br />
					replied the charioteer,<br />
					and drove up to the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vipassi addressed him, saying: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"You, master,<br />
					what have you done<br />
					that your head is not as other men's heads,<br />
					nor your clothes<br />
					as those of other men?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, my lord,<br />
					am one who has gone forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What, master, is that,<br />
					to have gone forth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It means, my lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Excellently indeed, master,<br />

					<p class="f4">16. Then the lord Vipassi, brethren,<br />
					bade his charioteer, saying: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come then, good charioteer,<br />
					do you take the carriage<br />
					and drive it hence back to my rooms.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I will even here<br />
					cut off my hair,<br />
					and don the yellow robe,<br />
					and go forth from the House<br />
					into the Homeless state."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> "Yea, my lord,"<br />
					replied the charioteer,<br />
					and drove back.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the lord Vipassi,<br />
					there and then,<br />
					cutting off his hair<br />
					and donning the yellow robe,<br />
					went forth from the House<br />
					into the Homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Now at Bandhumati, brethren,<br />
					the rāja's seat,<br />
					a great number of persons —<br />
					some eighty-four thousand souls<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					heard of what lord Vipassi had done,<br />
					and thought: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely this is no ordinary religious rule,<br />
					this is no common going forth,<br />
					in that the lord Vipassi himself<br />
					has had his head shaved<br />
					and has donned the yellow robe<br />
					and has gone forth from the House<br />
					into the Homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the lord Vipassi has done this,<br />
					why then should not we also?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And they all had their heads shaved,<br />
					and donned the yellow robes,<br />
					and in imitation of Vipassi the Bodhisat<br />
					they went forth from the House<br />
					into the Homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Vipassi the Bodhisat<br />
					went on his rounds through the villages,<br />
					towns,<br />
					and cities<br />
					accompanied by that multitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. Now there arose, brethren,<br />
					in the mind of Vipassi the Bodhisat,<br />
					when he was meditating in seclusion,<br />
					the following consideration: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"That indeed is not suitable for me<br />
					that I should live beset.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Twere better were I to dwell alone,<br />
					far from the crowd!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So after a time he dwelt alone,<br />
					away from the crowd.</p>

					<p class="f4">These eighty-four thousand Wanderers went one way,<br />
					and Vipassi the Bodhisat<br />
					went another way.</p>

					<p class="f4">19. Now there arose, brethren,<br />
					in the mind of Vipassi the Bodhisat,<br />
					when he had gone to his place,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"Verily this world has fallen upon trouble;<br />

					and falls from one state,<br />
					and springs up in another.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg24"><span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></a> And from this suffering, moreover,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then to Vipassi the Bodhisat, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, from attention to the cause<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a> 3. Then, brethren, did that Great Brahma,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Great Brahma, brethren,<br />

					<p class="f4">And a second time, brethren,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. But this Great Brahma, brethren, addressed Vipassi a third time:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings whose eyes are hardly dimmed by dust,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, when Vipassi the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					became aware of the entreaty of the Brahma,<br />

					with a Buddha's Eye<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And so looking, brethren,<br />
					he saw beings whose eyes were nearly free from dust,<br />
					<a id="pg32"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span></a> and beings whose eyes were much dimmed with dust,<br />
					beings sharp of sense<br />
					and blunted in sense,<br />
					beings of good and of evil disposition,<br />
					beings docile and indocile,<br />
					some among them discerning the danger in rebirth<br />
					and in other worlds,<br />
					and the danger in wrong doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">As in a pond of blue,<br />
					or red,<br />
					or white lotuses,<br />
					some lotus-plants born in the water<br />
					grow up in the water,<br />
					do not emerge from the water,<br />
					but thrive sunken beneath;<br />
					and other lotus-plants,<br />
					born in the water<br />
					and grown up in the water,<br />
					reach to the level;<br />
					while other lotus-plants<br />
					born in the water<br />
					and grown up in the water,<br />
					stand thrusting themselves above the water,<br />
					undrenched by it;<br />
					even so, brethren, did Vipassi the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					look down over the world with a Buddha's Eye,<br />
					and see beings whose eyes were much dimmed with dust,<br />
					beings sharp of sense<br />

					beings docile and indocile,<br />
					some among them discerning the danger in rebirth<br />

					and the danger in wrong doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Thereupon that Great Brahma, brethren,<br />
					when he became aware in thought<br />
					of the thoughts of Vipassi,<br />
					spoke to him in verse: —<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"As on a crag, on crest of mountain standing,<br />
							A man might watch the people far below,<br />
							E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br />
							O Seer of all, the terraced heights of Truth,<br />
							Look down, from grief released, upon the nations<br />
							Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.<br />
							Arise, thou Hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br />
							Thou freed from debt! Lord of the pilgrim band!<br />
							Walk the world o'er, sublime and blessed Teacher!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Teach us the Truth; there are who'll understand."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg33"><span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span></a> Thereupon, brethren, Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					made response in verse to that great Brahma: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Wide opened are the portals to Nirvana!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Let those that hear renounce their empty faith!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Despairing of the weary task, O Brahma,<br />
							I spake not of this doctrine, sweet and good, to men."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, brethren, that Great Brahma thinking: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily I am the one<br />
					by whom an opening has been given<br />
					for the preaching of the Truth<br />
					by Vipassi the Exalted One, the Arahant, the Buddha Supreme,"</p>

					<p class="f4">bowed down before Vipassi,<br />
					and passing round him by the left vanished away.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then to Vipassi, brethren, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					this occurred: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"To whom now should I first preach the Truth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will quickly understand this doctrine?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is Khaṇḍa a rāja's son,<br />
					and Tissa, the chaplain's son,<br />
					both dwelling at Bandhumati.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are learned, open-minded and wise,<br />
					and for long have had but little dust in their eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were now to teach the Truth first to them,<br />
					they would quickly understand it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, brethren, did Vipassi,<br />
					like a strong man stretching his bent arm out,<br />
					or drawing back his outstretched arm,<br />
					vanish from the Wisdom Tree<br />
					and appear in the Sanctuary,<br />
					in the deer-park at Bandhumati.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn79" href="#n79">79</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">9. And Vipassi, brethren,<br />
					bade the park-keeper, saying: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ho you, good park-keeper,<br />
					go into Ban- <a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> dhumati and tell Khaṇḍa the rāja's son,<br />
					and Tissa the chaplain's son, that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					has arrived at Bandhumati<br />
					and abides in the Khema deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wishes to see you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ay, my lord,"<br />
					replied the park-keeper,<br />
					and went to Bandhumati<br />
					and gave this message to Khanda<br />
					and Tissa:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					has arrived at Bandhumati<br />
					and abides in the Khema deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wishes to see you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">10. Then they,<br />
					ordering out their state carriages,<br />
					mounted,<br />
					and drove out from Bandhumati<br />
					to the deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">As far as there was a road<br />
					they drove,<br />
					and then alighting<br />
					went on foot into the presence of Vipassi.</p>

					<p class="f4">And being come<br />
					they saluted Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					and seated themselves beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. To them Vipassi discoursed in due order;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn80" href="#n80">80</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is to say,<br />
					he gave them illustrative talk on generosity,<br />
					on right conduct,<br />
					on heaven,<br />
					on the danger,<br />
					the vanity<br />
					and the defilement of lusts,<br />
					on the advantages of renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Exalted One saw that they had become prepared,<br />
					softened,<br />
					un-prejudiced,<br />
					upraised<br />
					and believing in heart,<br />
					then he proclaimed that Truth<br />
					which the Buddhas alone have won;<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the doctrine of Sorrow,<br />
					of its origin,<br />
					of its cessation,<br />
					and the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just as a clean cloth,<br />
					from which all stain has been washed away,<br />
					will readily take the dye,<br />
					just even so did Khaṇḍa and Tissa obtain,<br />
					even while sitting there,<br />
					the pure and stainless Eye for the Truth,<br />
					and they knew: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever has a beginning,<br />
					in that is also inherent<br />
					the necessity of passing away."</p>

					<p class="f4">12. Then they having seen the Truth,<br />
					won the Truth,<br />
					understood the Truth,<br />
					sounded the depths of Truth,<br />
					having crossed the waters of doubt<br />
					and put away perplexity,<br />
					having gained full confidence<br />
					and become dependent on none other<br />
					for the teaching of the Master,<br />
					addressed Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					and said: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord,<br />
					most excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just <a id="pg35"><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span></a> as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which has been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which has been hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that those who had eyes<br />
					could see external forms, —<br />
					even so has the truth been made known<br />
					in many a figure<br />
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">We here, lord, betake ourselves<br />
					to the Exalted One as our guide,<br />
					and to the Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">May we be suffered<br />
					to go forth from the world<br />
					under the Exalted One,<br />
					may we be suffered<br />
					to obtain ordination."</p>

					<p class="f4">13. And so, brethren, Khaṇḍa the rāja's son<br />
					and Tissa the chaplain's son<br />
					obtained retreat<br />
					and ordination<br />
					under Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Them did Vipassi instruct,<br />
					arouse,<br />
					incite<br />
					and gladden<br />
					with religious discourse,<br />
					making clear the danger,<br />
					the vanity<br />
					and the corruption of component things,<br />
					and the advantage in Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they<br />
					thus instructed,<br />
					aroused,<br />
					incited<br />
					and gladdened by his discourse,<br />
					their hearts ere long,<br />
					being void of grasping,<br />
					were set free from the Intoxicants.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">14. Now a great multitude, brethren,<br />
					of the inhabitants of Bandhumati —<br />
					some 84,000 souls —<br />
					heard that Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					had come to Bandhumati<br />
					and was staying at the Sanctuary (Khema),<br />
					in the deer-preserve;<br />
					and how Khaṇḍa the rāja's son<br />
					and Tissa the chaplain's son,<br />
					had actually<br />
					at his instigation<br />
					shaved their heads<br />
					and put on the yellow robe,<br />
					and had gone forth from the House<br />
					into the Homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">And hearing it they thought: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely this is no ordinary religious rule,<br />
					this is no common going forth,<br />
					in that the rāja's son<br />

					<p class="f4">Khaṇḍa and Tissa have indeed done this;<br />

					<p class="f4">So all that multitude came out from Bandhumati<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />

					<p class="f4">17. And so, brethren, those 84,000 souls<br />

					<p class="f4">And hearing it they thought: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely this is no ordinary religious rule,<br />
					this is no common going forth,<br />
					in that the rāja's son<br />
					and the chaplain's son<br />
					and these 84,000 souls<br />
					have had their heads shaved,<br />
					have donned the yellow robe<br />
					and gone forth from the House<br />
					into the Homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Khaṇḍa and Tissa<br />
					and these 84,000 souls<br />
					have indeed done this;<br />
					why then should not we?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So all that multitude of recluses came out from Bandhumati<br />
					to see Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					and when they were in his presence<br />
					they saluted him and sat down by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to them Vipassi discoursed in due order;<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					he gave them illustrative talk on generosity,<br />
					on right conduct,<br />
					on heaven,<br />
					on the danger,<br />
					the vanity<br />
					and the defilement of lusts,<br />
					on the advantages of renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One saw that they had become prepared,<br />
					softened,<br />
					un-prejudiced,<br />
					upraised<br />
					and believing in heart,<br />
					then he proclaimed that Truth<br />
					which the Buddhas alone have won;<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the doctrine of Sorrow,<br />
					of its origin,<br />
					of its cessation,<br />
					and the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just as a clean cloth,<br />
					from which all stain has been washed away,<br />
					will readily take the dye,<br />
					just even so did those 84,000 souls obtain,<br />
					even while sitting there,<br />
					the pure and stainless Eye for the Truth,<br />
					and they knew: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever has a beginning,<br />
					in that is also inherent<br />
					the necessity of passing away."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they having seen the Truth,<br />
					won the Truth,<br />
					understood the Truth,<br />
					sounded the depths of Truth,<br />
					having crossed the waters of doubt<br />
					and put away perplexity,<br />
					having gained full confidence<br />
					and become dependent on none other<br />
					for the teaching of the Master,<br />
					addressed Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />
					and said: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most excellent, lord,<br />
					most excellent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up<br />
					that which has been thrown down,<br />
					or were to reveal<br />
					that which has been hidden away,<br />
					or were to point out the right road<br />
					to him who has gone astray,<br />
					or were to bring a light into the darkness<br />
					so that those who had eyes<br />
					could see external forms, —<br />
					even so has the truth been made known<br />
					in many a figure<br />
					by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">We here, lord, betake ourselves<br />
					to the Exalted One as our guide,<br />
					and to the Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">May we be suffered<br />
					to go forth from the world<br />
					under the Exalted One,<br />
					may we be suffered<br />
					to obtain ordination."</p>

					<p class="f4">17. 'And so, brethren, those 84,000 recluses<br />
					obtained retreat<br />
					and ordination<br />
					under Vipassi, the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Them did Vipassi instruct,<br />
					arouse,<br />
					incite<br />
					and gladden<br />
					with religious discourse,<br />
					making clear the danger,<br />
					the vanity<br />
					and the corruption of component things,<br />
					and the advantage in Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they<br />
					thus instructed,<br />
					aroused,<br />
					incited<br />
					and gladdened by his discourse,<br />
					their hearts ere long,<br />
					being void of grasping,<br />
					were set free from the Intoxicants.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">22. Now at that time, brethren, a vast company of bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a>]</sup></span> was staying at Bandhumati.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to Vipassi the Exalted One, Arahant, Buddha Supreme,<br />

					this idea arose in his mind: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is now a vast company of bhikkhus dwelling at Bandhumati.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were now to grant leave to the bhikkhus and say: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, draping his outer robe over one shoulder,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now to me as I meditated in solitude<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Kareri,</i> according to Childers, is <i>Capparis trifoliata.</i> The Cy. states that this tree which stood by the entrance to the cottage was a Varuṇa-tree, suggestive, if true, of the superseded tree-cult into which Varuṇa-worship had declined. See Rhys Davids's <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.012.religion1.htm#pg235">'Buddhist India,' p. 235;</a> <i>Jāt.</i> IV, 8. There were four principal buildings in the Jeta Wood: the cottage or chamber in question, the Kosamba-tree cottage, a perfumed chamber, and the fir-tree house (<i>salaḷa = sarala-ghara</i>). According to the commentator each cost 100,000 [? kahapaṇas] to build, but the ancient bas-relief on the Bharahat Tope shows clearly cottages, and apparently cottages of only one room each. In § 12 below this cottage is called a vihāra; and the latter word, in the ancient texts, always means a single room or lodging-place. Anātha-piṇḍika had built the first three, King Pasenadi the last.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Māḷo.</i> Buddhaghosa describes this as a <i>nisīdana-sālā,</i> or sitting-room, built near the cottage. At the time when this Suttanta was composed it meant a thatched roof supported by wooden pillars. There were no walls to it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> According to the Cy. only religious teachers, religious disciples, Pacceka-Buddhas, and the Saviour Buddhas could recall their own or other previous lives, and, of the first, only those who taught Karma. Except the memories of the great Buddhas, which have no limit whatever, a limit is given in the case of each of these classes, past which they could not recall. This systematizing of a popular belief seems to indicate that, when Buddhaghosa lived, no claim to such transcendent memory was actually made among his contemporaries.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa distinguishes between the 'omniscient knowledge' by which the Buddha realizes the drift of the talk in the Brahmajāla Suttanta ('<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm">Dialogues,' I, 2</a>), and the divine hearing, as by a finer sense, operating here.</p>

The notes appended by Dr. Neumann to his translation of that Sutta, giving parallels from Christian archaeology, are of great interest. [<i>Reden Gotamo Buddho's</i> Majjhimanikayo, III, pp. 253 ft.) How the Birth-legend had developed in the fifth century A.D. may be seen in the Nidanakatha, translated in Rhys Davids's <i>'Buddhist Birth Stories,'</i> pp. 62 ff.<br />
					This state of mind in Rule the first, according to a voluminous comment by Buddhaghosa, refers more to the termination of the Bodhisat's life in the Tusita heaven, than to any miraculous embryonic commencement. He is depicted as being fully aware, with his angelic neighbours, of the imminent culminating career awaiting him, and to have selected country, region, town, father and mother, on the eve of his 'fall' from heaven. He is further said to be conscious that he was <i>qu¢</i> god deceased: — 'Thus fallen (or deceased) he knows 'I fall.' But he is not aware of his <i>cuti-cittaɱ,</i> or dying thought. As to when there is awareness of re-conception, the Buddhist fathers were not agreed. But they admit that, in its content, the dawning idea was either the first, or the fifth of the eight types of 'good thought' enumerated in Dhamma-Sangaṇi (pp. 1, 39 of the translation). But we learn, under § 21, that there was no consciousness by way of the five senses before birth.</p>

They would be undergoing purgatory for karma of grievous offences against parents and the religious world, and of cruelty to animals. Very long in body and with bats' nails, they were condemned to crawl up the Cakkavāḷa rock, till finding no food, they turned back and fell into the river of brine flowing round the world. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This simile, occurring in a similar connexion in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg121"><i>M.</i> III, 121,</a> is elsewhere (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.03.pali.bd.htm"><i>'Dialogues,'</i> I, 87;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg17"><i>M.</i> II, 17</a>) applied to self-knowledge, <i>i.e.</i> of one's body and mind and their interdependence. The point of the simile is not the perfection of the jewel, but the clarity of vision. The myth of the visible embryo recurs in mediaeval Christian art. See Neumann, <i>op. cit.;</i> and <i>'Buddhist Birth Stories,'</i> p. 65 <i>n.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The Cy. holds that these disjunctives may be understood to include a term of from seven to twelve months. Seven months' embryos, it adds, live, but cannot endure heat or cold; eight months' babes do not live — a midwife tradition that, we fancy, is still current here and now.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Cf. the account of the birth of Gotama, <i>'Buddhist Birth Stories,'</i> p. 66, and of the <i>four,</i> not <i>three,</i> adoring kings in some early Christian bas-reliefs, Neumann, op. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> As an emblem of sovereignty, says the Cy., in which case the emblem is usually named, not its bearers. But these were devata, angels or fairies or gods.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Each action of the babe had for the later Buddhists its symbolical meaning. Standing on the earth meant obtaining the Four Iddhipadas. Facing the north meant the spiritual conquest of multitudes. The seven strides were the Seven Bojjhangas. The canopy was the umbrella of emancipation. Looking around meant unveiled knowledge. The bull-cry meant the irrevocable turning of the wheel of the Truth or Law. The 'lion-roar' of 'the last birth' meant the arahantship he would attain in this life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Suppaṭṭhita-pādo:</i> literally, 'well-planted feet.' The traditional meaning is, that the whole under-surface touched the ground at once. The Great Man was 'flat-footed,' and did not toe or heel the ground in walking.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> If the foot of a 'Great Man' be measured in four parts, two are taken up by the sole and toes, one is under the leg, and one is the heel projecting rearward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> And all four, fingers and toes, are of equal length, like a monkey's. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Like a lattice, says the Cy., and explains this to mean that there is no 'webbing' between fingers and toes, but that these are set in right lines, like the meshes of a net.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Ensuring the maximum of flexibility. Cy. This is desirable in sitting cross-legged.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> With protuberant well-modelled joints, like an ear of rice or barley. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Hence the Buddhas only wash as an example to their followers. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> He will not stoop, nor lean backward, as if catching at the stars, nor have a crooked spine, but tower up symmetrically like a golden tower-gate in a city of the gods. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> <i>Citantaraṁso,</i> lit. he has the shoulder-interval filled up. The Cy. explains, the two sides of the back have no depression in the middle, nor look separated, but from the small of the back upwards the fleshy covering is as a level golden slab.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Literally, he has the banyan circumference. It was believed that a banyan always measured the same, like the diameter of a circle, in height as in width.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Samavattakkhandho.</i> According to the Cy. the exterior of the whole vocal apparatus is here meant, rather than the trunk or shoulders only.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> That is, the Great Man at a more adult stage has eight more than the normal thirty-two. How the learned brahmins saw these signs in the babe is not explained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> According to Childers, the Indian cuckoo. The Great Man's voice is very clear and pure-toned, neither worn nor broken nor harsh. Cy. Yoga-culture is to-day held to yield, as one result, a pleasant musical voice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Like flax-blossom. Cy. Perhaps a tradition of Aryan origin.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> Completely surrounding the eyes, thick like a black cow's; bright and soft like a new-born red calf's. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> <i>Uṇhīsa-sīso.</i> This expression, says the Cy., refers to the fullness either of the forehead or of the cranium. In either case the rounded highly-developed appearance is meant, giving to the unadorned head the decorative dignified effect of a crested turban, and the smooth symmetry of a water-bubble.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> In the text this refrain occurs after the naming of each mark. [Ed.: Here expanded.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> Literally by hip to hip; women passing him from arm to arm, men from one shoulder to another, explains the Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> The Cy. relates of the bird that it sings a flute-like song after pecking at honey and mangoes, and that the song exercises a sort of Orpheus-spell over every beast that hears it. Asandhimittā, the consort of Asoka, was converted by it. She had inquired of the Order, if it were known what the Buddha's voice was like; and on its being compared to the karavīka's song, wished to hear that. Asoka sent for one, which would not sing in its cage, till a mirror was placed by it. Fancying it saw a kinsman, it sang, throwing every one into ecstasies, and so exalting the queen's idea of the Buddha's voice, that she attained 'the fruit of <i>sotāpatti.</i>'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> That is, not by special practice, but as the result of action in former births, as with the fairies' power of vision. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Vipassi refers rather to the inward vision of the seer. Vipassana is insight or intuition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> Namely by giving signs of dissatisfaction when a decision was wrong.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> <i>Nippurisehi turiyehi.</i> Both words are ambiguous. Childers, following B.R., who follow Wilson, renders <i>turiya</i> by musical instrument. It is very doubtful whether it ever means that. Music, or orchestra, seems to be required in such passages as I have noted. <i>Nippurisa</i> (only found as yet in this connexion) may be non-human (that is, fairy), or not male. See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.17.pali.bd.htm#pg171"><i>D.</i> II, 171;</a> <i>M.</i> I, 571; <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.038.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> I, 145;</a> <i>Vin.</i> I, 15; II, 180; <i>J.</i> I, 58, and Senart's note at <i>Mahāvastu</i> III, 486. The alternative rendering would therefore be 'fairy music' But the commentator evidently takes the words in the meaning given above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> The legendary age of humans at the time of Vipassi was 80,000 years, so that we may reckon 1000 of his years as one of ours. When this legend is afterwards related of Gotama Buddha (in the <i>Nidānakathā</i>), he is said to have reached his majority (sixteen years) when the drives begin.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> <i>Antepuraṁ,</i> or harem. Tradition adds that he 'dismissed his womenfolk, and sat alone in his bedchamber, pierced in heart by this first dart.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> Text repeats in full as in § 1. [Ed.: Here expanded.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> <i>Pāṇa,</i> 'living creatures.' The number is the usual idiom for a multitude, no more pretending to accuracy than our 'a thousand thanks.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Vāsupagato. The commentary explains this as meaning 'when seated under his Wisdom-Tree.' But the word in the text is quite vague; and it is only the later tradition which thought it edifying to limit all such deep questions as the one discussed in the following sections to one time and place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> <i>Yoniso manasikārā.</i> The Cy. paraphrases thus that interesting idiom: '<i>i.e.</i> from attention to expedients (<i>upāya,</i> that is, expedients in analysis, comp. <i>S.</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.12.015.pali.bd.htm#pg17">II, 17;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.090.pali.bd.htm#pg135">III, 135;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.053.pali.bd.htm">III, 53;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.112.pali.bd.htm">III, 161;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/10_tens/an10.060.pali.bd.htm#pg111">A.

There is here no attempt to substitute, as an equivalent for <i>yoni,</i> a term for origin or basis — <i>nidāna, e.g.</i> or <i>mūla.</i> The observation that is <i>yoniso</i> appears to Buddhaghosa to be of causation viewed as phenomenal only, as process of invariable antecedent and consequent, with application of the methods of induction known since J. S. Mill as the Methods of Agreement and Difference.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> The translating of <i>upādanaɱ</i> must always be inadequate; we having no word to fill its dual sense of something-to-hand, Staff, fuel, and a laying hold of something. If 'data,' which is etymologically' akin, had chanced to be <i>danda,</i> there would have been an approximation in implication. That the term, in the commentarial tradition, held this active force is clear from <i>anupādāya,</i> 'void of grasping,' being paraphrased by <i>agahetvā,</i> not having laid hold of. See also <i>'Psychological Ethics,'</i> p. 322, <i>n.</i> 1; <i>'Asl.'</i> pp. 385, 450.</p>

							<p>Notes 58-59. What Rhys Davids calls 'the representative faculty' is <i>'mano'</i> 'mind' the cognitive aspect of what we call the mind. Western thought is reluctant to call 'mind' an organ of sense.<br />
							'Name-and-form' <i>'nāma-rūpa'</i> is better left as 'name-and-form' than thought of as 'mind and matter'. Rhys Davids thought is again here conditioned by Western philosophy. The idea is 'named-forms'. What individualized consciousness (consciousness that has come into existence) is aware of is named-forms. Named-forms give rise to consciousness. Identification with consciousness of named-forms is what is called existence. Existence is bound up in individuality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> The sixfold field is the sphere of action of the six senses; that is, our five senses, and the representative faculty.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> The Cy. here inquires into the omission of the two ultimate links in the 'Chain of Causation' that are given in most of the passages where the formula occurs — notably in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm">Nidana Samyutta</a> and in the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i> (I, pp. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.009.pali.bd.htm#pg49">49-52,</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.038.pali.bd.htm#pg261">261,</a> etc.); also in <i>Dh.S.,</i> p. 348, and <i>Vibh.,</i> pp. 135 <i>ff.</i> It judges that, whereas <i>avijjā</i> and <i>sahkhārā</i> relate to existence <i>prior</i> to that in which the remainder of the terms from <i>viññāṇaṁ</i> to <i>jarāmaraṇaṁ,</i> for any given individual, hold true, Vipassi's <i>vipassanā</i> was confining itself to any given present life. Mr. Loveday, in his essay on the 'Chain,' also came to the conclusion that, to apply the links in succession to any individual life, 'ignorance' and 'the sahkharas' must be referred to prior existence. (<i>J.A.O.S.,</i> 1894.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> In <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p67"><i>S.</i> II, 114</a> their independence is compared to two sheaves of reeds leaning one against the other.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Literally 'the Vipassanā Way to insight.' As this is not a stock phrase in this connexion it doubtless contains a play on the name Vipassi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> That is, the new individual, divisible into five constituent parts, called into being by the grasping attitude maintained during the previous life. <i>Khandho,</i> group, is rendered by 'body' in § 19 — 'whole body of Ill' — and, in both connexions, is always paraphrased by <i>rāsi,</i> or heap. Buddhist Pluralism turned away from unifying concepts, and chose to picture organic processes under aggregates. The concept is not so atomistic as we might think, the 'heap' referring to past and potential repetition of process.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> This is the standing phrase for the attainment, not of Buddhahood, but of Arahantship.

Such low crafts, however, are not classed as <i>takka</i> in the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#p8">'Moralities' list of Dialogues, I, pp. 16 ff.</a> And it is very possible that <i>'takka'</i> conveyed, to the religious mind of that day, much the same that so-called 'mere logic' or 'sophistry' does at the present time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> 'Although merely referred to,' says the Cy., 'as one among them, he is to be understood as the chief Great-Brahma in this universe.' But the title of Sahampati, given in the Vinaya and Majjhima versions, seems to be a later gloss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> On the super-normal sense of a Buddha, one of his ten <i>balas</i> or powers, see <i>'Vibhanga,'</i> p. 340.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> The following verses and the response are otherwise arranged in the Vinaya and Majjhima versions, in the former immediately following the deity's petition, in the latter immediately following the lotus simile.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> In the text simply, O Exalted (or Blessed) One; — practically the only expression not literally reproduced.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> <i>Amatassa dvārā;</i> literally the doors of ambrosia. On this term see Appendix I.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn3" href="#edn3">ed3</a>]</sup></span> Cf. also <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.034.pali.bd.htm#pg227"><i>M.</i> I, 227:</a> — <i>amatadvāraṁ.</i> 'Wide-flung the living gate, the safe (road) leading to Nirvana.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> <i>Pamuñcantu saddhaɱ.</i> The expression is ambiguous. Oldenberg, 'Vinaya Texts' I, 88, renders it 'Let them send forth faith to meet it.' We think it means let them give up their faith in rites, and gods, and ceremonies, with especial references to the offerings to the dead. Comp. R.0. Franke in Z.D.M.G., 1909, p. 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> Tradition apparently identified this with Isipatana, the deer-park, in Gotama Buddha's time, at Benares, and attributed the name Khema to the park as having been given as a deer-preserve, or refuge. Cy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> Cf. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.03.rhyt.pts.htm#pg135"><i>'Dialogues,'</i> I, p. 135.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> <i>Aṭṭha-saṭṭhi sata-sahassaɱ</i> — 6,800.000 — is the literal figure given. See <a href="#pg39">p. 39.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Pātimokkha,</i></a> literally the Disburdenment. The text as we have it (translated in 'Vinaya Texts' Vol. I) dates only from the times of early Buddhism, and it is not likely that this technical name used as the title was much older.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> These verses, except lines 8 and 9, have been included in the Dhammapada 184-6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> The Suddhāvāsā devā comprise the five highest spheres of celestials in the so-called <i>Rūpa loka,</i> <i>i.e.</i> the universe of Form, the five being named successively in the text. Beyond these five heavens were yet four spheres of the Formless. The following paragraphs develop the assertion on <a href="#pg7">p. 7:</a> 'And gods also have revealed these matters to him.' ...</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> The text here is greatly abbreviated. It is intended that numbers of the gods claim to have been, in a previous birth, the followers of each successive Buddha; and § 29 is to be understood, in full, for each Buddha. The full text is given, as usual, for the first and last cases only. {Ed.: here expanded fully.}</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> The Cy. interprets as active: — <i>na kañci sattaṁ tapentī ti</i> — they torment no one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Paraphrased as 'lovely to look at, beautiful, charming.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> Paraphrased as 'because they see vividly the beautiful vision of the former.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> Rhys Davids omits rather than abridges. In abridgments I unabridge following the Pali, using Rhys David's terminology and make no typographical distinction. Where he has simply omitted a passage I reconstruct it from the Pali using his terminology, place it in square brackets and italicize.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn3" href="#edfn3">ed3</a>]</sup> I do not find any 'Appendix 1' in my copies of this or the other volumes of the Dialogues.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn4" href="#edfn4">ed4</a>]</sup> The text abbreviates and gives no clue as to the diminishing numbers of devas. The number for Sikhi is 'thousands' as with Vipassi, the number for Gotama is 'hundreds.' One would expect a diminishing number for each Buddha proportional to the stated following of Arahants. It is also conceivable that each description of each Buddha contained the text in full of the 'leaving the world, becoming a recluse, etc.' but this is not indicated in the text. Also for this group of sections I have retained the wording of their first appearance whereas Woodward has altered the order and some wording. I have changed the wording for the Gotama entry to that given by Rhys Davids.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn5" href="#edfn5">ed5</a>]</sup> Rhys Davids abridges with: [And in each of these heavens numbers of the gods accosted me and told me of their previous birth under Vipassi and the following Buddhas down to the present one, myself.]</p>
