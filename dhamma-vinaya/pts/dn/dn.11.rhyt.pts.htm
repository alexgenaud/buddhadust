					<h4 class="ctr c">Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Kevaddha Sutta</h4>

					<p>In this Sutta we have the position taken up by the early Buddhists, and no doubt by Gotama himself, as to the practice of the wonders or miracles, in which there was then universal belief.</p>

					<p>They were not, however, miracles in our Western sense. There was no interference by an outside power with the laws of nature. It was supposed that certain people, by reason of special (but quite natural) powers, could accomplish certain special acts beyond the power of ordinary men. These acts are eight in number: and as set forth in detail (above, (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.03.pali.bd.htm#pg88">: pp. 88, 89</a>) remind us of some (not of all) the powers now attributed to mediums. The belief is not Buddhist. It is pre-Buddhistic, and common to all schools of thought in India.</p>

					<p>As usual<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Buddha is represented as not taking the trouble to doubt or dispute the fact of the existence of such powers. He simply says that he loathes the practice of them and that a greater and better wonder than any or all of them; is education in the system of self-training which culminates in Arahatship. There is no evidence of a similarly reasonable view of this question of wonders having been put forward by any Indian teacher before the Buddha.</p>

					<p>It is very strange that Childers should have stated (<i>Dict,</i> P. 157) that 'Iddhī is the peculiar attribute of the Arahats.' He gives no authority for the statement. Devadatta, who was the very reverse of an Arahat, was noted for his power of Iddhī. And of the many Arahats mentioned in the books, only one or two, notably <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna,</a> were famed for this acquirement. They could have it, of course; just as they could have any craft or skill of the unconverted. But the eight powers referred to above are called the <i>'pothujjanikā'</i> — or <i>'puthujjanikā-īddhī'</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> or <i>āmisā-iddhī</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>; that is, pre- <a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> cisely not an attribute of the Arahats, or even of men in the lower stages of the Path, but of the worldly, the unconverted, a practice carried out for worldly gain.</p>

					<p>We have the Iddhī, the majestic movement, of animals<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the Iddhī, the glory and majesty and potency, of a king<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> — the Iddhī, the prosperity and splendour, of a rich young man<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> — the Iddhī, the craft and power, of a hunter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> — the Iddhī, in the technical sense just explained, of the unconverted wonder-worker. The Iddhī of the Arahats, as such, was the majesty and potency of their victory, of their emancipation.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>In illustration of his position Gotama is represented to have told a wonderful legend-how a Bhikshu, seeking the answer to a deep problem in religion and philosophy, goes up and up, by the power of his Iddhī, from world to world, appealing to the gods. In each heaven, as he mounts ever higher, the gods confess their ignorance, and send him on to the gods above, more potent and more glorious than they. And so he comes at last to the great god of gods, the Mahā Brahmā himself, only to be taken discreetly aside, and told in confidence, so that the gods may not hear it, that he too, the Mahā Brahmā, does not know the answer!</p>

					<p>All the details of the story are worked out with persistent humour, characteristic of such legends in the Buddhist books, in order to bring out the two lessons — in the first place how, in all such matters, to trust to the gods is to lean on a broken reed; and secondly, how perfectly useless is the power of such Iddhī, which, even at its best, can give no better help than that to one in earnest about higher things.</p>

					<p>The problem put is of great interest; and goes to the very core of the Buddhist <i>Welt-anschauung,</i> of Buddhist philosophy. <i>The world, as we know it, is within each of us.</i></p>

					<p>'Verily, I declare to you, my friend, that within this very body, mortal as it is and only a fathom high, but conscious and endowed with mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> is, the world, and the waxing thereof, and the waning thereof, and the way that leads to the passing away thereof!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>On this Dr. Karl, Neumann, whose illustrations of Buddhist <a id="pg274"><span class="f2 g"><b>[274]</b></span></a> texts from passages in Western literature, old and new, are so happy, appropriately compares Schopenhauer's saying (<i>W.W.V.</i> I, 538),'One can also say that Kant's teaching leads to the view that the beginning and end of the world are not to be sought without, but within, us.'</p>

					<p>The problem, as put by the Bhikshu to the gods, is: 'Where do the elements pass away?' The Buddha, in giving his solution, first says that that is not the right way to put the question. It ought to be: 'Where do the elements find no foothold; where does that union of qualities that make a person (<i>nāma</i> and <i>rūpa</i>) pass away?'</p>

					<p>The alteration is suggestive. The person should be introduced; a thinking being. We only know of the elements and their derivatives, as reflected in, constructed by, human intelligence. To the question, as thus altered, the answer is: 'They find no foothold in the mind of the Arahat, and when intellection (with special reference to the representative faculty) ceases, then they, and the person with them, cease.'</p>

					<p>So in the Bāhiya story <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p10">(<i>Ud.</i> I, 10)</a> we are told:</p>

							<p class="in2">'There, where earth, water, fire, and wind no footing find,<br />
							There are the nights not bright, nor suns resplendent,<br />
							No moon shines there, there is no darkness seen.<br />
							And then, when he, the Arahat hath, in his wisdom, seen;<br />
							From well and ill, from form and formless, is he freed!'</p>

					<p>This is a striking, and in all probability intentional, contrast to the Upanishad passages where the same kind of language is used of the Great Soul, the corollary of the human soul. It is one of many instances (as has been pointed out by Father Dahlmann) where the same expressions, used in the <i>Piṭakas</i> of the Arahat, are used in the older or later priestly speculation of God.</p>

					<p>We have another reference to the view that the Four Elements find no foothold in the Arahat at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.01.021-030.pali.bd.htm#pg15"><i>Saɱyutta</i> I, 15</a> And we see what is meant by this from <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v1111">verse 1111 in the <i>Sutta Nipāta:</i></a> 'To him who harbours no delight in feelings that arise, either from within or without, cognition <i>(Viññāṇa)</i> tends to wane.' That is, of course, not that his mental activity grows less — the mental alertness of the Arahat is laid stress upon throughout the books. The picture drawn of the Arahat <i>par excellence,</i> the Buddha himself, is a standing example of what the early Buddhists considered a man to be in whom the Viññāṇa had waned. Whatever else it is, it is the very reverse of a man intellectually asleep, unconscious of what is said to him dull to ideas. But it is the picture of <a id="pg275"><span class="f2 g"><b>[275]</b></span></a> a man to whom the Four Elements, and all that follows from them, material things, and the ways in which they affect him, have ceased to have the paramount importance they have to the thoughtless.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy,<br />
					who knows all worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />

					the Brahmas, and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples, —<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />

					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the Tathāgata (the one who has found the truth);<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has thus become a recluse<br />
					he lives self-restrained by that restraint that should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight,<br />
					and he sees danger<br />
					in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure are his means of livelihood,<br />
					good is his conduct,<br />
					guarded the doors of his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindful and self-possessed<br />

					and expecting that gifts will come,<br />
					he passes his life in honesty<br />

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof,<br />
					far off from the vulgar practice,<br />
					from the sexual act.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Kevaddha, the Great Brahmā<br />
					took that brother by the arm<br />
					and led him aside,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These gods,<br />
					the retinue of Brahmā,<br />

					that there is nothing I cannot see,<br />
					nothing I have not understood,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore I gave no answer<br />

					<p class="f4">I do not know, brother,<br />
					where those four great elements —<br />

					cease,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore you, brother, have done wrong,<br />

					you have undertaken this long search,<br />

					for an answer to this question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go you now,<br />
					return to the Exalted One,<br />
					ask him the question,<br />
					and accept the answer<br />
					according as he shall make reply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">84. Then, Kevaddha, that Bhikkhu,<br />
					as quickly as one could stretch forth his bended arm,<br />
					or draw it in when stretched forth,<br />
					vanished from the Brahmā world,<br />
					and appeared before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he bowed in salutation to me,<br />
					and took his seat on one side;<br />
					and, so seated,<br />
					he said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where is it, Sir,<br />
					that these four great elements —<br />
					earth, water, fire, and wind —<br />
					cease,<br />
					leaving no trace behind?'</p>

					<p class="f4">85. And when he had thus spoken, Kevaddha,<br />
					I answered him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Long, long ago, brother,<br />
					<a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> sea-faring traders were wont,<br />
					when they were setting sail on an ocean voyage,<br />
					to take with them a land-sighting bird.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the ship got out of sight of the shore<br />
					they would let the land-sighting bird free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bird would fly to the East,<br />
					and to the South<br />
					and to the West,<br />
					and to the North,<br />
					to the zenith,<br />
					and to the intermediate points of the compass.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if anywhere on the horizon<br />
					it caught sight of land,<br />
					thither would it fly.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if no land,<br />
					all around about,<br />
					were visible,<br />
					it would come back even to the ship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, brother, do you,<br />
					having sought an answer to this question,<br />
					and sought it in vain,<br />
					even up to the Brahmā-world,<br />
					come back therefore to me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><b>[223]</b></span> Now the question, brother,<br />
					should not be put as you have put it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead of asking<br />
					where the four great elements cease,<br />
					leaving no trace behind,<br />
					you should have asked:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Where do earth, water, fire, and wind,<br />
							And long and short, and fine and coarse,<br />
							Pure and impure, no footing find?<br />
							Where is it that both name and form<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Die out, leaving no trace behind?"</p>

					<p class="f4">On that, the answer is:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"The intellect of Arahatship,<br />
							the invisible,<br />
							the endless,<br />
							accessible from every side.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg284"><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></a> There is it that earth, water, fire, and wind,<br />
							And long and short, and fine and coarse,<br />
							Pure and impure, no footing find.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">There is it that both name and form<br />
							Die out, leaving, no trace behind.<br />
							When intellection ceases they all also cease."'</p>

					<p>Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Kevaddha, the young householder,<br />
					pleased at heart,<br />
					rejoiced at the spoken word.</p>

It is most probable that the <i>Jātaka</i> is right in both cases as to the meaning of these charm-names, and that the objector is intentionally represented, like Kaṇha in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p3"><i>Ambaṭṭha Suttanta,</i></a> to be 'drawing the long bow.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> From here to the end has been translated by the late Henry C. Warren in his <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-67.htm"><i>'Buddhism in Translations,'</i> pp. 308 foll.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> The question and answer in §68 is repeated, in the text, in each case.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> So also <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#pg31">above, p. 31.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Atisitvā.</i> The Siamese edition has <i>abhisiṅsitvā.</i> On <i>atisitvā</i> see Morris in the <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1886_ii.pdf"><i>J.P.T.S.,</i> 1886,</a> and Fausböll at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#v366"><i>S.N.</i> II, 366</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>Nāmā ca rūpā ca;</i> that is, the mental and the physical. Dr. Neumann puts this into nineteenth-century language by translating — 'subject and object.' And however un-Buddhistic the phrase may be — for no Buddhist would use an expression apparently implying a unity in the subject — it really, if by subject be understood an ever-changing group of impermanent faculties or qualities, comes very near to the Buddhist meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Pahaɱ.</i> Buddhaghosa takes this in the sense of <i>tittha;</i> that is, ghat, flight of steps or shelving beach from which to step down into water. James d'Alwis, who usually gives the view of Baṭuwan Tuḍawa, took it as = <i>pabhaɱ,</i> shining — which Buddhaghosa, who gives it as an alternative explanation, had rejected (<i>'Buddhist Nirvāṇa,'</i> P. 39). Dr. Neumann, the only European writer who has discussed the point, thinks it is put by the poet, <i>metri causā</i> for <i>pajahaɱ,</i> 'rejecting.' But an English poet, if he wanted to save a syllable, would scarcely write 'reacting for rejecting.' And the Pāli poet, had he wished to give that meaning, could easily have found other means. He need have gone no further afield than adopting simply <i>jahaɱ.</i> That <i>viññāṇa,</i> when qualified by such adjectives as those here used, can be meant for the <i>viññāna</i> of a man who has attained to Nirvāṇa, could be supported by other passages from the <i>Piṭakas.</i></p>
