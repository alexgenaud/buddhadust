					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Lohikka Sutta</b></h4>

					<p>It is not easy to put ourselves in the mental position suitable for appreciating the kind of idea that underlies the argument in this Suttanta. The social view against which it is directed lies too remote from the social views universally admitted now in the West. But in the sixth century B.C. in the Eastern valley of the Ganges, the question as to the ethics of teachers and teaching was one of wide interest and of great importance.</p>

					<p>Saŋkara quotes with approval the rules of the priestly law books which lay down that the ears of a Sūdra who hears the Veda (including of course the theosophy of the Upanishads) are to be filled with molten lead and lac. His tongue is to be split if he recites it; his body is to be cut through if he preserves it in his memory.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> God himself has bestowed the exclusive right of teaching upon the hereditary priests;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> who indeed claim to be, each of them, great divinities,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> even to the gods.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> And it would be a danger to social order if they taught women, or any males not twice-born, or any twice-born males who would not share their views as to the ethics of teaching, and as to the privileges and prerogatives of the priest as teacher.</p>

					<p>These passages are much later than the Piṭakas. But they, and the many others like them, give a fair idea of the spirit animating one section at least of the priests, and of a trend of opinion that doubtless had its supporters also in Piṭaka times. When Asoka thought he had brought about such a chance in public opinion that those who had been very gods upon the earth had come to be gods no longer, he was very far from thinking right. That is a battle that is not so easily won. But the expression of his belief is sufficient to show that the striking idea he thought he had killed was far older than our existing text of Manu.</p>

					<p>On the other hand one may be permitted to doubt whether the gentle measures approved by Saŋkara for keeping people in that state of life into which their evil deeds in a previous birth had brought them, were ever actually, in practice, <a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a> carried out. The Piṭakas themselves give ample proof that, in spite of the priests, there were not a few base-born people who succeeded, in that time at least, not only in getting taught, but in becoming teachers. And this was not the case only among the despised Buddhists. The numerous passages collected by Dr. Muir in his article in the 'Indian Antiquary' for 1877 show that the priestly literature itself — the law books and the epics — has preserved evidence of the lax way in which the strict rules as to exclusion from teaching or being taught were really carried out. And that is especially the case, according to the priestly tradition, in ancient times, as old, or older, than the rise of Buddhism.</p>

					<p>The fact doubtless is that, though there were bigots among the Brahmans, and though they were strong enough to establish, before the time to which our present Sutta refers, rules as to restriction of teaching which no one in priestly circles could venture formally to dispute — yet that there was also always a strong party in India, to which many of the more liberal minded of the Brahmans themselves belonged, who looked with sympathy on relaxations of these rules. The general practice must have been that, the hereditary priests kept the magic of the sacrifice, and the emoluments and privileges that went with the knowledge of it, in their own hands. Even the higher teaching of the mysteries of theosophy was to be handed down only from priest-father to son, or from priestly teacher to pupil. But there were many exceptions. The numerous Brahmans who were not priests were wont, of course, to emphasise the importance rather of birth than of knowledge. We have enough evidence, even in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads, of others, besides the priests, being teachers of the higher wisdom. The four powerful kings, and the still important free clans, though they gave support to the Brahmans, gave also equal support to other teachers — just as, in later times, Hindu and Buddhist sovereigns are found supporting Buddhists and Hindus alike.</p>

					<p>Our knowledge of Indian views of life having been hitherto derived almost exclusively from the priestly books, scholars have inevitably tended to attach too great a degree of importance to what the priests describe as the proper state of things. As a matter of fact it never really prevailed. Even now the Brahmans, or those who in the census returns claim to be such, form only about five per cent of the population. And of these the vast majority are not priests at all; they are engaged in all sorts of worldly occupations.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> We <a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> must not judge India at any time, much less in the time of the Buddha, through the yellow spectacles of Saŋkara, or even of the priestly compilers of Manu. As M. Barth said, already in 1873, in protesting against Lassen for falling into this mistake:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> 'We must distinguish, more than Lassen does, between different epochs, as well as between the pretensions of a caste and the real state of things. The Brahmans had not yet monopolised the intellectual life. Certain testimonies of the epics, applicable to this very period, as also the very nature of the Vedic books, show for example that there existed alongside of them an entire profane literature of great extent ... .which was certainly, at first, in other hands. ... Their teaching (that of the Brahmans), it is true, appears to have been in a high degree esoteric and exclusive.'</p>

					<p>The position taken up by the Buddha on this question, as appears from our present Sutta (and such other passages as M. I, 513-.524; A. I, 277; III, 123-127; M.P.S. II, 32 = A. III, 69 = V, 56 = Mil. 144), is that every one should be allowed to learn; that every one, having certain abilities, should be allowed to teach; and that, if he does teach, he should teach all and to all; keeping nothing back, shutting no one out. But no man should take upon himself to teach others unless and until he have first taught himself, and have also acquired the faculty of imparting to others the truth he has gained himself.</p>

					<p>There can, I think, be very little doubt but that the great teacher is here voicing the opinion of many others of liberal views, his contemporaries and predecessors. He lays no claim, either in our Sutta or elsewhere, to any special peculiarity in this respect. It is taken for granted that the arguments put into his mouth in our Sutta will appeal to the Brahman to whom they are addressed. And they are based not on any distinctively Buddhist doctrine but on general ethical principles accepted, or rather acceptable, by all.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">XII. Lohikka Sutta</h4>

					<h1>Some Points in the Ethics of Teaching</h1>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.12.than.ati.htm#p1">than</a>]</span> T<span class="f2">HUS</span> H<span class="f2">AVE</span> I <span class="f2">HEARD</span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One, when once passing on a tour through the Kosala districts with a great multitude of the members of the Order, with about five hundred Bhikshus, arrived at Sālavatikā (a village surrounded by a row of Sāla trees).</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Lohikka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> the Brahman was established at Sālavatikā, a spot teeming with life, with much grassland and woodland and corn, on a royal domain granted him by King Pasenadi of Kosala, as a royal gift, with power over it as if he were the king.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time Lohikka the Brahman was thinking of harbouring, the following wicked view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose that a Samaṇa or a Brāhmaṇa have reached up to some good state (of mind), then he should tell no one else about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what can one man do for another?</p>

					<p class="f4">To tell others would be like the man who, having broken through an old bond, should entangle himself in a new one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, I say, is this (desire to declare to others); it is a form of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what can one man do for another?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg289"><span class="f2 g"><b>[289]</b></span></a> Now Lohikka the Brahman heard the news:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say that the Samaṇa Gotama, of the sons of the Sākyas, as, who went out from the Sākya clan to adopt the religious life, has now arrived, with a great company of the brethren of his Order, on his tour through the Kosala districts, at Sālavatikā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"That Exalted One is an Arahat, fully awakened, abounding, in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, an exalted one, a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly knows, and sees as it were face-to-face, this universe — including the worlds above of the gods, the Brahmās, and the Māras; and the world below with its Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas, its princes and peoples — and having, known it, he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim both in the spirit and in the letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher life doth he make known in all its fullness, and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And good is it to pay visits to Arahats like that."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt225" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg225"><span class="f2">[225]</span></a> 4. Then Lohikka the Brahman said to Bhesikā the barber:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come now, good Bhesikā, go where the Samaṇa Gotama is staying, and, on your arrival, ask in my name as to whether his sickness and indisposition has abated, as to his health and vigour and condition of ease; and speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the venerable Gotama, and with him the brethren of the Order, accept the to-morrow's meal from Lohikka the Brahman.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">5. "Very well, Sir," said Bhesikā the barber, acquiescing in the word of Lohikka the Brahman, and did so even as he had been enjoined.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented, by silence, to his request.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And when Bhesikā the barber. perceived that the Exalted One had consented, he rose from his seat, and passing the Exalted One with his right hand towards him, went to Lohikka the Brahman, and on his arrival spake to him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg290"><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></a> "We addressed that Exalted One,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Sir, in your name, even as you commanded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One hath consented to come."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt226" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg226"><span class="f2">[226]</span></a> 7. Then Lohikka the Brahman, when the night had passed, made ready at his, own dwelling place sweet food, both hard and soft, and said to Bhesikā the barber:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come now, good Bhesikā, go where the Samaṇa Gotama is staying, and on your arrival, announce the time to him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is time, O Gotama, and the meal is ready.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, Sir," said Bhesikā the barber in assent to the words of Lohikka the Brahman; and did so even as he had been enjoined.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One, who had robed himself early in the early morning, went robed, and carrying his bowl with him, with the brethren of the Order, towards Sālavatikā.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Now, as he went, Bhesikā the barber walked, step by step, behind the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The following wicked opinion has occurred to Lohikka the Brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose that a Samaṇa or a Brahmaṇa have reached up to some good state (of mind), then he should tell no one else about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what can one man do for another?</p>

					<p class="f4">To tell others would be like the man who, having broken through an old bond, should entangle himself in a new one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, I say, is this (desire to declare to others); it is a form of lust.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Twere well, Sir, if the Exalted One would disabuse his mind thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what can one man do for another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That may well be, Bhesikā, that may well be."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt227" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg227"><span class="f2">[227]</span></a>9. And the Exalted One went on to the dwelling-place of Lohikka the Brahman, and sat down on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Lohikka the Brahman satisfied the Order, with the Buddha at its head, with his own hand, with sweet food both hard <a id="pg291"><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></a> and soft, until they refused any more.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One had finished his meal, and had cleansed the bowl and his hands, Lohikka the Brahman brought a low seat and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to him, thus seated, the Exalted One spake as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, what they say, Lohikka, that the following wicked opinion has arisen in your mind:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose that a Samaṇa or a Brahmaṇa have reached up to some good state (of mind), then he should tell no one else about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what can one man do for another?</p>

					<p class="f4">To tell others would be like the man who, having broken through an old bond, should entangle himself in a new one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, I say, is this (desire to declare to others); it is a form of lust'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is so, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "Now what think you, Lohikka?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you not established at Sālavatikā?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, that is so, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then suppose, Lohikka, one were to speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lohikka the Brahman has a domain at Sālavatikā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him alone enjoy all the revenue and all the produce of Sālavatikā, allowing nothing to anybody else!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the utterer of that speech be a danger-maker as touching the men who live in dependence upon you, or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He would be a danger-maker, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And making that danger, would he be a person who sympathised with their welfare, or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He would not be considering their welfare, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And not considering their welfare, would his heart stand fast in love toward them, or in enmity?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In enmity, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when one's heart stands fast in enmity, is that unsound doctrine, or sound?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is unsound doctrine, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now if a man hold unsound doctrine, Lohikka, I declare that one of two future births will be his lot, either purgatory or rebirth as an animal.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt228" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg228"><span class="f2">[228]</span></a>11. Now what think you, Lohikka?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is not King Pasenadi of Kosala in possession of Kāsi and Kosala?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, that is so, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then suppose, Lohikka, one were to speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'King Pasenadi of Kosala is in possession of Kāsi and Kosala.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him enjoy all the revenue and all the produce of Kāsi and Kosala, allowing nothing to <a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> anybody else.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the utterer of that speech be a danger-maker as touching the men who live in dependence on King Pasenadi of Kosala — both you yourself and others — or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He would be a danger-maker, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And making that danger, would he be a person who sympathised with their welfare, or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He would not be considering their welfare, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And not considering their welfare, would his heart stand fast in love toward them, or in enmity?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In enmity, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when one's heart stands fast in enmity, is that unsound doctrine, or sound?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is unsound doctrine, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now if a man hold unsound doctrine, Lohikka, I declare that one of two future births will be his lot, either purgatory or rebirth as an animal.</p>

					<p class="f4">12 and 14. So then, Lohikka, you admit that he Who should say that you, being in occupation of Sālavatikā, should therefore yourself enjoy all the revenue and produce thereof, bestowing nothing on any one else; and he who should say that King Pasenadi of Kosala, being in power over Kāsi and Kosala, should therefore himself enjoy all the revenue and produce thereof, bestowing nothing on any one else — would be making danger for those living in dependence on you; or for those, you and others, living in dependence upon the King.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that those who thus make danger for others, must be wanting in sympathy for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that the man wanting in sympathy has his heart set fast in enmity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that to have one's heart set fast in enmity is unsound doctrine: --</p>

					<p class="f4">13 and 15. Then just so, Lohikka, he who should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose a Samaṇa or a Brāhmaṇa to have reached up to some good state (of mind), then should he tell no one else about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For what can one man do for another?</p>

					<p class="f4">To tell others would be like the man who, having broken through an old bond, should entangle himself in a new one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, I say, is this desire to declare to others, it is a form of lust' —</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt229" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg229"><span class="f2">[229]</span></a> just <a id="pg293"><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></a> so he who should say thus, would be putting obstacles in the way of those clansman who, having taken upon themselves the Doctrine and Discipline — set forth by Him-who-has-won-the-Truth, have attained to great distinction therein — to the fruit of conversion, for instance, or to the fruit of once returning, or to the fruit of never returning, or even to Arahatship — he would be putting obstacles in the way of those who are bringing to fruition the course of conduct that will lead to rebirth in states of bliss in heaven.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But putting obstacles in their way he would be out of sympathy for their welfare; being out of sympathy for their welfare his heart would become established in enmity; and when one's heart is established in enmity, that is unsound doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now if a man hold unsound doctrine, Lohikka, I declare that one of two future births will be his lot, either purgatory or rebirth as an animal<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt230" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg230"><span class="f2">[230]</span></a> 16. 'There are these three sorts of teachers in the world, Lohikka, who are worthy of blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whosoever should blame such a one, his rebuke would be justified, in accord with the facts and the truth, not improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first place, Lohikka, there is a sort of teacher who has not himself attained to that aim of Samaṇaship for the sake of which he left his home and adopted the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without having himself attained to it he teaches a doctrine (Dhamma) to his hearers, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is good for you, this will make you happy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those hearers of his neither listen to him, nor give ear to his words, nor become stedfast in heart through their knowledge thereof; they go their own way, apart from the teaching, of the master.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a teacher may be rebuked, setting out these facts, and <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> adding:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are like one who should make advances to her who keeps repulsing him, or should embrace her who turns her face away from him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, do I say, is this lust of yours (to go on posing as a teacher of men, no one heeding, since they trust you not).</p>

					<p class="f4">For what, then, can one man do for another?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Lohikka, is the first sort of teacher in the world worthy of blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whosoever should blame such a one, his rebuke would be justified, in accord with the facts and the truth, not improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">17. In the second place, Lohikka, there is a sort of teacher who has not himself attained to that aim of Samaṇaship for the sake of which he left his home and adopted the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without having himself attained to it he teaches a doctrine to his hearers, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is good for you; that will make you happy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And to him his disciples listen; <a id="pt231" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg231"><span class="f2">[231]</span></a> they give ear to his words; they become stedfast in heart by their understanding what is said; and they go not their own way, apart from the teaching of the master.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a teacher may be rebuked, setting out these facts and adding:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are like a man who, neglecting his own field, should take thought to weed out his neighbour's field.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, do I say, is this lust of yours (to go on teaching others when you have not taught yourself).</p>

					<p class="f4">For what, then, can one man do for another?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, Lohikka, is the second sort of teacher in the world worthy of blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whosoever should blame such a one, his rebuke would be justified, in accord with the facts and the truth, not improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">18. And again, Lohikka, in the third place, there is a sort of teacher who has himself attained to that aim of Samaṇaship for the sake of which he left his home and adopted the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having himself attained it, he teaches the doctrine to his hearers, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is good for you, that will make you happy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But those hearers of his neither listen to him, nor give ear to his words, nor become stedfast in heart through understanding thereof; they go their own way, apart <a id="pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> from the teaching of the master.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a teacher may be rebuked, setting out these facts, and adding:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are like a man who, having broken through an old bond, should entangle himself in a new one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that, do I say, is this lust of yours (to go on teaching when you have not trained yourself to teach).</p>

					<p class="f4">For what, then, can one man do for another?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Lohikka, is the third sort of teacher in the world worthy of blame.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whosoever should blame such a one, his rebuke would be justified, in accord with the facts and the truth, not improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">And these, Lohikka, are the three sorts of teachers of which I spoke."</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>[<a id="pt232" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg232"><span class="f2">[232]</span></a>, <a id="pt233" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg233"><span class="f2">[233]</span></a>]</b> 19. And when he had thus spoken, Lohikka the Brahman spake thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is there, Gotama, any sort of teacher not worthy of blame in the world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lohikka, there is a teacher not worthy, in the world, of blame."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what sort of a teacher, Gotama, is so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, Lohikka, there appears in the world<br />
					one who has won the truth, an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy,<br />
					who knows all worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One, a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face this universe,<br />
					— including the worlds above of the gods,<br />
					the Brahmas, and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples, —<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />
					doth he proclaim,<br />
					both in the spirit and in the letter,<br />
					the higher life doth he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or one of his children,<br />
					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the Tathāgata (the one who has found the truth);<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes, and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the killing of living things,<br />
					he holds aloof<br />
					from the destruction of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lays the cudgel and the sword aside,<br />
					and ashamed of roughness,<br />
					and full of mercy,<br />
					he dwells compassionate and kind<br />
					to all creatures that have life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the taking of what has not been given,<br />
					he lives aloof<br />
					from grasping what is not his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes only what is given,<br />
					and expecting that gifts will come,<br />
					he passes his life in honesty<br />
					and purity of heart.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away unchastity,<br />
					he is chaste.</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds himself aloof,<br />
					far off,<br />
					from the vulgar practice,<br />
					from the sexual act.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away lying words,<br />
					he holds himself aloof<br />
					from falsehood.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks truth,<br />
					from the truth he never swerves;<br />
					faithful and trustworthy,<br />
					he breaks not his word to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away slander,<br />
					he holds himself aloof<br />
					from calumny.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he hears here<br />

					to raise a quarrel against the people here;<br />
					what he hears elsewhere<br />
					he repeats not here<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus does he live as a binder together<br />
					of those who are divided,<br />
					an encourager of those who are friends,<br />
					a peacemaker,<br />
					a lover of peace,<br />
					impassioned for peace,<br />
					a speaker of words that make for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away rudeness of speech,<br />
					he holds himself aloof<br />
					from harsh language.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever word is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the ear,<br />
					lovely,<br />
					reaching to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					pleasing to the people,<br />
					beloved of the people -<br />

					on religion,<br />
					on the discipline of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas some recluses and Brahmans,<br />

					<p class="f4">(25) Administering medicines in rotation.</p>

					<p class="f4">he holds aloof from such low arts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then he, Lohikka,<br />
					being thus master of the minor moralities,<br />
					sees no danger from any side,<br />
					that is, so far as concerns<br />
					his self-restraint in conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka, as a sovereign, duly crowned,<br />
					whose enemies have been beaten down,<br />
					sees no danger from any side;<br />
					that is, so far as enemies are concerned,<br />
					so is he confident.</p>

					<p class="f4">And endowed with this body of morals,<br />
					so worthy of honour,<br />
					he experiences, within himself,<br />
					a sense of ease without alloy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is it, Lohikka, that he becomes righteous.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Lohikka, is he guarded as to the doors of his senses?</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Lohikka, he sees an object with his eye<br />
					he is not entranced in the general appearance or the details of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sets himself to restrain<br />
					that which might give occasion for evil states,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					to flow in over him<br />
					so long as he dwells unrestrained<br />
					as to his sense of sight.<br />
					He keeps watch upon his faculty of sight,<br />
					and he attains to mastery over it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so, in like manner,<br />
					when he hears a sound with his ear,<br />
					or smells an odour with his nose,<br />
					or tastes a flavour with his tongue,<br />
					or feels a touch with his body,<br />
					or when he cognises a phenomenon with his mind<br />
					he is not entranced in the general appearance or the details of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sets himself to restrain<br />
					that which might give occasion for evil states,<br />
					covetousness and dejection,<br />
					to flow in over him<br />
					so long as he dwells unrestrained<br />
					as to his mental (representative) faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps watch upon his representative faculty,<br />
					and he attains to mastery over it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And endowed with this self-restraint,<br />
					so worthy of honour,<br />
					as regards the senses,<br />
					he experiences, within himself, a sense of ease<br />
					into which no evil state can enter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is it, Lohikka,<br />
					that he becomes guarded<br />
					as to the doors of his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Lohikka, is he mindful and self-possessed?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this matter, Lohikka, he<br />
					in going forth or in coming back<br />
					keeps clearly before his mind's eye<br />
					<i>(all that is wrapt up therein — the immediate object of the act itself, its ethical significance, whether or not it is conducive to the high aim set before him, and the real facts underlying the mere phenomenon of the outward act).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And so also in looking forward,<br />
					or in looking round;<br />
					in stretching forth his arm,<br />
					or in drawing it in again;<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in masticating or swallowing,<br />
					in obeying the calls of nature,<br />
					in going or standing or sitting,<br />
					in sleeping or waking,<br />
					in speaking or in being still,<br />
					he keeps himself aware<br />
					of all it really means.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is it, Lohikka,<br />
					that he becomes mindful and self-possessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Lohikka, is he content?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this matter, Lohikka,<br />
					he is satisfied with sufficient robes<br />
					to cherish his body,<br />
					with sufficient food<br />
					to keep his stomach going.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whithersoever he may go forth,<br />
					these he takes with him as he goes<br />
					- just as a bird with his wings, Lohikka,<br />
					whithersoever he may fly,<br />
					carries his wings with him as he flies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is it, Lohikka,<br />
					that he becomes content.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, master of this so excellent body of moral precepts,<br />
					gifted with this so excellent self-restraint as to the senses,<br />
					endowed with this so excellent mindfulness and self-possession,<br />
					filled with this so excellent content,<br />
					he chooses some lonely spot<br />
					to rest at on his way<br />
					— in the woods,<br />
					at the foot of a tree,<br />
					on a hill side,<br />
					in a mountain glen,<br />
					in a rocky cave,<br />
					in a charnel place,<br />
					or on a heap of straw in the open field.</p>

					<p class="f4">And returning thither after his round for alms<br />
					he seats himself, when his meal is done,<br />
					cross-legged,<br />
					keeping his body erect,<br />
					and his intelligence alert, intent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the hankering after the world,<br />
					he remains with a heart that hankers not,<br />
					and purifies his mind of lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the corruption of the wish to injure,<br />
					he remains with a heart free from ill temper,<br />
					and purifies his mind of malevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away torpor of heart and mind,<br />
					keeping his ideas alight,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he purifies his mind of weakness and of sloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away flurry and worry,<br />
					he remains free from fretfulness,<br />
					and with heart serene within,<br />
					he purifies himself of irritability and vexation of spirit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away wavering,<br />
					he remains as one passed beyond perplexity;<br />
					and no longer in suspense as to what is good,<br />
					he purifies his mind of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Lohikka,<br />
					as when a man, after contracting a loan,<br />
					should set a business on foot,<br />
					and his business should succeed,<br />
					and he should not only be able<br />
					to pay off the old debt he had incurred,<br />
					but there should be a surplus over<br />
					to maintain a wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then would he realise:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I used to have to carry on my business<br />
					by getting into debt,<br />
					but it has gone so well with me<br />
					that I have paid off what I owed,<br />
					and have a surplus over<br />
					to maintain a wife.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were a prey to disease,<br />
					in pain, and very ill,<br />
					and his food would not digest,<br />
					and there were no strength left in him;<br />
					and after a time<br />
					he were to recover from that disease,<br />
					and his food should digest,<br />
					and his strength come back to him;<br />
					then, when he realised his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were bound in a prison house,<br />
					and after a time<br />
					he should be set free from his bonds,<br />
					safe and sound,<br />
					and without any confiscation of his goods;<br />
					when he realised his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were a slave,<br />
					not his own master,<br />
					subject to another,<br />
					unable to go whither he would;<br />
					and after a time<br />
					he should be emancipated from that slavery,<br />
					become his own master,<br />
					not subject to others,<br />
					a free man,<br />
					free to go whither he would;<br />
					then, on realising his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man, rich and prosperous,<br />
					were to find himself on a long road,<br />
					in a desert, where no food was,<br />
					but much danger;<br />
					and after a time<br />
					were to find himself out of the desert,<br />
					arrived safe,<br />
					on the borders of his village,<br />
					in security and peace;<br />
					then, on realising his former and his present state,<br />
					he would be of good cheer at that,<br />
					he would be glad of heart at that: —</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, Lohikka, he,<br />
					so long as these five hindrances<br />
					are not put away within him<br />
					looks upon himself as in debt,<br />
					diseased,<br />
					in prison,<br />
					in slavery,<br />
					lost on a desert road.<br />
					But when these five hindrances<br />
					have been put away within him,<br />
					he looks upon himself as freed from debt,<br />
					rid of disease,<br />
					out of jail,<br />
					a free man,<br />
					and secure.</p>

					<p class="f4">And gladness springs up within him<br />
					on his realising that,<br />
					and joy arises to him thus gladdened,<br />
					and so rejoicing<br />
					all his frame becomes at ease,<br />
					and being thus at ease<br />
					he is filled with a sense of peace,<br />
					and in that peace his heart is stayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then estranged from lusts,<br />
					aloof from evil dispositions,<br />
					he enters into and remains in the First Rapture<br />
					— a state of joy and ease born of detachment,<br />
					reasoning and investigation going on the while.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so pervade,<br />
					drench,<br />
					permeate,<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with the joy and ease born of detachment,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka, as a skilful bathman<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					will scatter perfumed soap powder<br />
					in a metal basin,<br />
					and then besprinkling it with water,<br />
					drop by drop,<br />
					will so knead it together<br />
					that the ball of lather,<br />
					taking up the unctuous moisture,<br />
					is drenched with it,<br />
					pervaded by it,<br />
					permeated by it within and without,<br />
					and there is no leakage possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Lohikka,<br />
					he suppressing all reasoning and investigation<br />
					enters into and abides in the Second Jhāna,<br />
					a state of joy and ease,<br />
					born of the serenity of concentration,<br />
					when no reasoning or investigation goes on,<br />
					— a state of elevation of mind,<br />
					a tranquillisation of the heart within.</p>

					<p class="f4">And his very body does he so pervade,<br />
					drench,<br />
					permeate,<br />
					and suffuse with the joy and ease born of concentration,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if there were a deep pool,<br />
					with water welling up into it<br />
					from a spring beneath,<br />
					and with no inlet from the east or west,<br />
					from the north or south,<br />
					and the god should not<br />
					from time to time<br />
					send down showers of rain upon it.<br />
					Still the current of cool waters<br />
					rising up from that spring<br />
					would pervade,<br />
					fill,<br />
					permeate,<br />
					and suffuse the pool<br />
					with cool waters,<br />
					and there would be no part or portion of the pool<br />
					unsuffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Lohikka, he,<br />
					holding aloof from joy,<br />
					becomes equable;<br />
					and mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he experiences in his body<br />
					that ease which the Arahats talk of when they say:<br />
					'The man serene and self-possessed<br />
					is well at ease,'<br />
					and so he enters into<br />
					and abides in the Third Jhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And his very body<br />
					does he so pervade,<br />
					drench,<br />
					permeate,<br />
					and suffuse with that ease<br />
					that has no joy with it,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as when in a lotus tank<br />
					the several lotus flowers,<br />
					red or white or blue,<br />
					born in the water,<br />
					grown up in the water,<br />
					not rising up above the surface of the water,<br />
					drawing up nourishment from the depths of the water,<br />
					are so pervaded,<br />
					drenched,<br />
					permeated,<br />
					and suffused<br />
					from their very tips<br />
					down to their roots<br />
					with the cool moisture thereof,<br />
					that there is no spot in the whole plant,<br />
					whether of the red lotus,<br />
					or of the white,<br />
					or of the blue,<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then further, Lohikka, he,<br />
					by the putting away alike of ease and of pain,<br />
					by the passing away alike of any elation,<br />
					any dejection,<br />
					he had previously felt,<br />
					enters into and abides in the Fourth Jhāna,<br />
					a state of pure self-possession and equanimity,<br />
					without pain and without ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sits there<br />
					so suffusing even his body<br />
					with that sense of purification,<br />
					of translucence of heart,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were sitting<br />
					so wrapt from head to foot in a clean white robe,<br />
					that there were no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not in contact with the clean white robe<br />
					— just so, Lohikka, does he sit there,<br />
					so suffusing even his body<br />
					with that sense of purification,<br />
					of translucence of heart,<br />
					that there is no spot in his whole frame<br />
					not suffused therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he applies and bends down his mind<br />
					to that insight that comes from knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">He grasps the fact:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This body of mine has form,<br />
					it is built up of the four elements,<br />
					it springs from father and mother,<br />
					it is continually renewed<br />
					by so much boiled rice and juicy foods,<br />
					its very nature is impermanence,<br />
					it is subject to erasion,<br />
					abrasion,<br />
					dissolution,<br />
					and disintegration;<br />
					and therein is this consciousness of mine, too, bound up,<br />
					on that does it depend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if there were a veluriya gem,<br />
					bright, of the purest water,<br />
					with eight facets,<br />
					excellently cut,<br />
					clear, translucent,<br />
					without a flaw,<br />
					excellent in every way.<br />
					And through it a string,<br />
					blue, or orange-coloured,<br />
					or red, or white, or yellow<br />
					should be threaded.<br />
					If a man, who had eyes to see,<br />
					were to take it into his hand,<br />
					he would clearly perceive<br />
					how the one is bound up with the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he applies and bends down his mind<br />
					to the calling up of a mental image.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls up from this body<br />
					another body,<br />
					having form,<br />
					made of mind,<br />
					having all (his own body's) limbs and parts,<br />
					not deprived of any organ.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were to pull out a reed from its sheath.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the reed,<br />
					this the sheath.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reed is one thing,<br />
					the sheath another.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from the sheath<br />
					that the reed has been drawn forth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And similarly were he to take a snake out of its slough,<br />
					or draw a sword from its scabbard.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he applies and bends down his mind<br />
					to the modes of the Wondrous Gift.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys the Wondrous Gift in its various modes<br />
					— being one he becomes many,<br />
					or having become many becomes one again;<br />
					he becomes visible or invisible;<br />
					he goes, feeling no obstruction,<br />
					to the further side of a wall or rampart or hill,<br />
					as if through air;<br />
					he penetrates up and down through solid ground,<br />
					as if through water;<br />
					he walks on water without breaking through,<br />
					as if on solid ground;<br />
					he travels cross-legged in the sky,<br />
					like the birds on wing;<br />
					even the Moon and the Sun,<br />
					so potent, so mighty though they be,<br />
					does he touch and feel with his hand;<br />
					he reaches in the body<br />
					even up to the heaven of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as a clever potter or his apprentice<br />
					could make,<br />
					could succeed in getting out of properly prepared clay<br />
					any shape of vessel he wanted to have<br />
					— or an ivory carver out of ivory,<br />
					or a goldsmith out of gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he applies and bends down his mind<br />
					to the Heavenly Ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">With that clear Heavenly Ear<br />
					surpassing the ear of men<br />
					he hears sounds both human and celestial,<br />
					whether far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were on the high road<br />
					and were to hear the sound of a kettledrum<br />
					or a tabor or the sound of chank horns and small drums<br />
					he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the sound of a kettledrum,<br />
					this is the sound of a tabor,<br />
					this of chank horns, and of drums.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he directs and bends down his mind<br />
					to the knowledge which penetrates the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Penetrating with his own heart<br />
					the hearts of other beings, of other men,<br />
					he knows them.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns —</p>

					<p class="f4">The passionate mind to be passionate,<br />
					and the calm mind calm;<br />
					the angry mind to be angry,<br />
					and the peaceful mind peaceful;<br />
					the dull mind to be dull,<br />
					and the alert mind alert;<br />
					the attentive mind to be attentive,<br />
					and the wandering mind wandering;<br />
					the broad mind to be broad,<br />
					and the narrow mind narrow;<br />
					the mean mind to be mean,<br />
					and the lofty mind lofty;<br />
					the stedfast mind to be stedfast,<br />
					and the wavering mind to be wavering;<br />
					the free mind to be free,<br />
					and the enslaved mind enslaved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as a woman or a man or a lad,<br />
					young and smart,<br />
					on considering attentively<br />
					the image of his own face<br />
					in a bright and brilliant mirror<br />
					or in a vessel of clear water<br />
					would, if it had a mole on it,<br />
					know that it had,<br />
					and if not,<br />
					would know it had not.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he directs and bends down his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the memory<br />
					of his previous temporary states.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recalls to mind<br />
					his various temporary states in days gone by<br />
					— one birth,<br />
					or two or three or four or five births,<br />
					or ten or twenty or thirty or forty or fifty<br />
					or a hundred or a thousand<br />
					or a hundred thousand births,<br />
					through many an aeon of dissolution,<br />
					many an aeon of evolution,<br />
					many an aeon of both dissolution and evolution.</p>

					<p class="f4">'In such a place such was my name,<br />
					such my family,<br />
					such my caste,<br />
					such my food,<br />
					such my experience of discomfort or of ease,<br />
					and such the limits of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed away from that state,<br />
					I took form again in such a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I had such and such a name<br />
					and family<br />
					and caste<br />
					and food<br />
					and experience of discomfort or of ease,<br />
					such was the limit of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed away from that state<br />
					I took form again here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">— thus does he call to mind<br />
					his temporary states in days gone by<br />
					in all their details,<br />
					and in all their modes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if a man were to go from his own to another village,<br />
					and from that one to another,<br />
					and from that one should return home.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'From my own village I came to that other one.</p>

					<p class="f4">There I stood in such and such a way,<br />
					sat thus, spake thus, and held my peace thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence I came to that other village;<br />
					and there I stood in such and such a way,<br />
					sat thus, spake thus, and held my peace thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, from that other village,<br />
					I have returned back again home.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he directs and bends down his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the fall and rise of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the pure Heavenly Eye,<br />
					surpassing that of men,<br />
					he sees beings as they pass away<br />
					from one form of existence<br />
					and take shape in another;<br />
					he recognises the mean and the noble,<br />
					the well favoured and the ill favoured,<br />
					the happy and the wretched,<br />
					passing away according to their deeds:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such beings,<br />
					evil-doers in act and word and thought,<br />
					revilers of the noble ones,<br />
					holding to wrong views,<br />
					acquiring for themselves that Karma<br />
					which results from wrong views,<br />
					they, on the dissolution of the body, after death,<br />
					are reborn in some unhappy state of suffering or woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But such and such beings,<br />
					well-doers in act and word and thought,<br />
					not revilers of the noble ones,<br />
					holding to right views,<br />
					acquiring for themselves that Karma<br />
					that results from right views,<br />
					they, on the dissolution of the body, after death,<br />
					are reborn in some happy state in heaven.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the pure Heavenly Eye,<br />
					surpassing that of men,<br />
					he sees beings as they pass away from one state of existence,<br />
					and take form in another;<br />
					he recognises the mean and the noble,<br />
					the well favoured and the ill favoured,<br />
					the happy and the wretched,<br />
					passing away according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if there were a house with an upper terrace on it<br />
					in the midst of a place where four roads meet,<br />
					and a man standing thereon,<br />
					and with eyes to see,<br />
					should watch men entering a house,<br />
					and coming forth out of it,<br />
					and walking hither and thither along the street,<br />
					and seated in the square in the midst.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those men are entering a house,<br />
					and those are leaving it,<br />
					and those are walking to and fro in the street,<br />
					and those are seated in the square in the midst.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus serene,<br />
					made pure, translucent,<br />
					cultured, devoid of evil,<br />
					supple, ready to act,<br />
					firm, and imperturbable,<br />
					he directs and bends down his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of the destruction of the Deadly Floods.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the Path that leads to the cessation of pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as they really are:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These are the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the origin of the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the cessation of the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the Path that leads to the cessation of the Deadly Floods.'</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, thus knowing, thus seeing,<br />
					the heart is set free<br />
					from the Deadly Taint of Lusts,<br />
					is set free from the Deadly Taint of Becomings,<br />
					is set free from the Deadly Taint of Ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, thus set free,<br />
					there arises the knowledge of his emancipation,<br />
					and he knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rebirth has been destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher life has been fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">What had to be done has been accomplished.</p>

					<p class="f4">After this present life there will be no beyond!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Lohikka,<br />
					as if in a mountain fastness<br />
					there were a pool of water,<br />
					clear, translucent, and serene;<br />
					and a man, standing on the bank,<br />
					and with eyes to see,<br />
					should perceive the oysters and the shells,<br />
					the gravel and the pebbles<br />
					and the shoals of fish<br />
					as they move about or lie within it:<br />
					he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This pool is clear, transparent, and serene,<br />
					and there within it<br />
					are the oysters and the shells,<br />
					and the sand and gravel,<br />
					and the shoals of fish are moving about or lying still.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg296"><span class="f2 g"><b>[296]</b></span></a> And whosoever the teacher be, Lohikka, under whom the disciple attains to distinction so excellent as that,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> that, Lohikka, is a teacher not open to blame in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whosoever should blame such a one, his rebuke would be unjustifiable, not in accord either with the facts or with the truth, without good ground."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt234" href="../../pali/dn/dn.12.pali.bd.htm#pg234"><span class="f2">[234]</span></a> 78. And when he had thus spoken, Lohikka the Brahman said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just, Gotama, as if a man had caught hold of a man, falling over the precipitous edge of purgatory, by the hair of his head, and lifted him up safe back on the firm land — just so have I, on the point of falling into purgatory, been lifted back on to the land by the venerable Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Most excellent, O Gotama, are the words of thy mouth, most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up what has been thrown down, or were to reveal what has been hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external forms — just even so has the truth been made known to me, in many a <a id="pg297"><span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span></a> figure, by the venerable Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I, even I, betake myself to the venerable Gotama as my guide, to the Doctrine, and to the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple; as one who, from this day forth as long as life endures, has taken him as his guide!"</p>

The census shows that out of 261 millions only fifteen millions could read or write. On this striking fact Mr. Baines comments (p. 211) 'The second influence antagonistic to a more general spread of literacy is the long continued existence of a hereditary class whose object it has been to maintain their own monopoly of book learning as the chief buttress of their social supremacy. The opposition of the Brahmins to the rise of the writer class has been already mentioned; and the repugnance of both, in the present day, to the diffusion of learning amongst the masses, can only be appreciated after long experience.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This is open to two interpretations: 'What can the teacher gain from a disciple?' or 'What can a disciple gain from a teacher?' 'Why should you trouble about others? they cannot help you!' or 'Why should you trouble about others? you cannot help them!' But in either case the implied ground of the argument is the proposition that a man's rise or fall, progress or defeat, in intellectual and religious matters, lies in himself. He must work out his own salvation.</p>
