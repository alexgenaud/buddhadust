					<h4><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>This Suttanta is an expansion of the conversation recorded in the Book of the Great Decease <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.16.rhyt.pts.htm#fn97">(above, Ch. V, § 17).</a></p>

					<p>The same legend recurs as the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_95">Mahā-Sudassana Jātaka, No. 95</a> in Mr. Fausböll's edition. As the latter differs in several important particulars from our Suttanta, it is probably not taken directly from it, but is merely derived from the same source. To facilitate comparison between the two I add here a translation of the Jātaka.</p>

					<p>The part enclosed in square brackets [] is the so-called Story of the Present: and the whole was probably written in Ceylon in the fifth century of our era. There is every reason to believe, for the reasons given in my <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.011.jataka.htm#pg201"><i>'Buddhist India'</i> (pp. 201-7),</a> that the stories themselves belong to a very early period in the history of Buddhism and are, many of them, older even than Buddhism. We may be sure that if this particular story had been abstracted by the author of the commentary from our Suttanta, he would not have ventured to introduce such serious changes into what he regarded as sacred writ.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">Mahā-Sudassana Jātaka.</h4>

					<p>['How transient are all component things.' This the Master told when lying on his death-couch, concerning that word of Ānanda the Thera, when he said:- 'Do not, O Exalted One, die in this little town,' and so on.</p>

					<p>When the Tathāgata was at the Jetavana<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn1" href="#in1">i1</a>]</sup></span> he thought:-</p>

					<p><a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> 'The Thera Sāriputta, who was born at Nālagāma, has died, on the day of the full moon in the month of Kattika, in the chamber in which he had been born;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn2" href="#in2">i2</a>]</sup></span> and Mahā-Moggallāna in the latter, the dark half of that same month. As my two chief disciples are thus dead, I too will pass away at Kusinārā.' Thereupon he proceeded straight on to that place, and lay down on the Uttarasisaka couch, between the twin Sāla trees, never to rise again.</p>

					<p>Then the venerable Ānanda besought him, saying:- 'Let not the Exalted One die in this little township, in this little town in the jungle, in this branch township. Let the Exalted One die in one of the other great cities, such as Rājagaha, and the rest!'</p>

					<p>But the Master answered:- 'Say not, Ānanda, that this is a little township, a little town in the jungle, a branch township. I was dwelling formerly in this town at the time when I was Sudassana, the king of kings; and then it was a great city, surrounded by a jewelled rampart, twelve leagues in length!</p>

					<p>And at the request of the Thera, he, telling the tale, uttered the Mahā-Sudassana-Sutta.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn3" href="#in3">i3</a>]</sup></span>]</p>

					<p>Now on that occasion when Queen Subhaddā saw Mahā-Sudassana when he had come down out of the Palace of Righteousness, and was lying down, not far off, on the appropriate couch, spread out in the grove of the seven kinds of gems, and when she said:- 'Thine, O king, are these four and eighty thousand cities, of which the chief is the royal city of Kusāvatī. Set thy heart on these';-</p>

					<p>Then replied Mahā-Sudassana: 'Speak not thus, O queen! but exhort me rather, saying:- "Cast away desire for these, long not after them.'"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn4" href="#in4">i4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg194"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span></a> And when she asked:- 'Why so, O king?' 'To-day my time is come, and I shall die!' was his reply.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn5" href="#in5">i5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Then the weeping queen, wiping her eyes, brought herself with difficulty and distress to address him accordingly. And having spoken, she wept, and lamented; and the other four and eighty thousand women wept too, and lamented; and of the attendant courtiers not one could restrain himself, but all also wept.</p>

					<p>But the Bodisat stopped them all, saying 'Enough, my friends! Be still!' And he exhorted the queen, saying:- 'Neither do thou, O queen, weep: neither do thou lament. For down even unto a grain of sesamum fruit there is no such thing as a compound which is permanent! All are transient, all have the inherent quality of dissolution!'</p>

					<p>And when he had so said, he further uttered this stanza:-</p>

					      <p class="in2">'How transient are all component things!<br />
							Growth is their nature and decay:<br />
							They are produced, they are dissolved again:<br />
							To bring them into full subjection, that is bliss.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn6" href="#in6">i6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>[In these verses the words 'How transient are all component things!' mean 'Dear lady Subhaddā, wheresoever and by whatsoever causes made or come together, compounds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn7" href="#in7">i7</a>]</sup></span> - that is, all those things which possess the essential constituents [whether material or mental] of existing things,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn8" href="#in8">i8</a>]</sup></span> - all these compounds are impermanence itself. For of these form<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn9" href="#in9">i9</a>]</sup></span> is impermanent, reason<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn10" href="#in10">i10</a>]</sup></span> is impermanent, the [mental] eye<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn11" href="#in11">i11</a>]</sup></span> is impermanent, and qualities<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn12" href="#in12">i12</a>]</sup></span> are impermanent. And whatever treasure there be, whether conscious or unconscious, that is transitory. Understand therefore "How transient are all component things!"</p>

					<p>'And why? "Growth is their nature and decay." These, all, have the inherent quality of coming into [individual] existence, and have also the inherent quality of growing old; or [in other words] their very nature is to come into existence and to be broken up. Therefore should it be understood that they are impermanent.</p>

					<p>'And since they are impermanent, when "they are produced, they are dissolved again." Having come into existence, <a id="pg195"><span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span></a> having reached a state,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn13" href="#in13">i13</a>]</sup></span> they are surely dissolved. For all these things come into existence, taking an individual form; and are dissolved, being broken up. To them as soon as there is birth, there is what is called a state; as soon as there is a state, there is what is called disintegration.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn14" href="#in14">i14</a>]</sup></span> For to the unborn there is no such thing as state, and there is no such thing as a state which is without disintegration. Thus are all compounds, having attained to the three characteristic marks [of impermanency, pain, and want of any abiding principle], subject, in this way and in that way, to dissolution. All these component things therefore, without exception, are impermanent, momentary, despicable, unstable, disintegrating, trembling, quaking, unlasting, sure to depart,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn15" href="#in15">i15</a>]</sup></span> only for a time,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn16" href="#in16">i16</a>]</sup></span> and without substance; as temporary as a phantom, as the mirage, or as foam!</p>

					<p>'How then in these, dear lady Subhaddā, can you feel any sign of satisfaction? Understand rather than "to bring them into subjection, that is bliss." For to bring them into subjection, since it involves mastery over the whole circle of transmigration, is the same as Nirvana. That and this are one'.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn17" href="#in17">i17</a>]</sup></span> And there is no other bliss than that.']</p>

					<p>And when Mahā-Sudassana had thus brought his discourse to a point with the ambrosial great Nirvana, and had made exhortation also to the rest of the great multitude, saying:- 'Give gifts! Observe the precepts! Keep the sacred days!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="ifn18" href="#in18">i18</a>]</sup></span> he became an inheritor of the world of the gods.</p>

					<p>[When the Master had concluded this lesson in the truth, he summed up the Jātaka, saying:- 'She who was then Subhaddā the queen was the mother of Rāhula, the great adviser was Rāhula, the rest of the retinue the Buddha's retinue, and Mahā-Sudassana I myself.']</p>

							<p>Rhys Davids here, as he often does, has hit upon an important fact, but has missed the interpretation most useful for the Buddhist. The <i>'sam'</i> in <i>Sankhārā</i> is there because what is being produced is, as well as being a 'thing,' the identification with the thing produced as being one's own, belonging to one; one's own world, own 'self'. The idea of a producer is not necessary when understanding the term this way.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p><a id="sankhara">The word</a> translated 'component things' or 'compounds' is <i>sankhārā,</i> literally confections, from <i>kar,</i> 'to make,' and sam, 'together.' It is a word very frequently used in Buddhist writings, and a word consequently of many different connotations; and there is, of course, no exactly corresponding word <a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> in English. 'Production' would often be very nearly correct, although it fails entirely to give the force of the preposition <i>sam;</i> but a greater objection to that word is the fact that it is generally used, not of things that have come into being of themselves, but of things that have been produced by some one else. It suggests, if it does not imply, a producer; which is contrary to the whole spirit of the Buddhist passages in which the word sankhārā occurs. In this important respect the word 'compound' is a much more accurate translation, though it lays somewhat too much stress on the <b>sam.</b></p>

					<p>The term Confections (to coin a rendering) is sometimes used to denote all things which have been brought together, made up, by pre-existing causes; phenomena in general. In this sense it includes, as the commentator here points out, all those material or mental qualities which unite to form an individual, a separate thing or being, whether conscious or unconscious.</p>

					<p>It is more usually used, (with special reference to their origin from pre-existing causes, and with allusion to the wider meanings just above explained), of the mental confections only, the mental constituents, of all sentient beings generally, or of man alone. In this sense it forms by itself one of the five classes or aggregates (khandha) into which the material and mental qualities of each separate individual are divided in Buddhist writings - the class of dispositions, capabilities, and all that goes together to make what we call character. This class has naturally enough been again divided and subdivided; and a full list of the Confections in this sense, as now acknowledged by orthodox Buddhists, will be found in my manual 'Buddhism' (pp. 91, 92). At the time when the Five Nikāyas reached their present form, no such elaborate list of Confections in detail seems to have been made; but the general sense of the word was, as is quite clear from the passages in which it occurs, the idea which these details together convey. It is this second and more usual meaning of the term which is more especially emphasized in the concluding verse of the above stanza.</p>

					<p>Turning now to the Suttanta itself, we find that the portion of the legend omitted in the Jātaka throws an unexpected light upon the tale; for it commences with a long description of the riches and glory of Mahā-Sudassana, and reveals in its details the instructive fact that the legend is nothing more nor less than a spiritualized sun-myth.</p>

					<p>It cannot be disputed that the sun-myth theory has become greatly discredited, and with reason, by having been used too <a id="pg197"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span></a> carelessly and freely as an explanation of religious legends of different times and countries which have really no historical connexion with the earlier awe and reverence inspired by the sun. The very mention of the word sun-myth is apt to call forth a smile of incredulity, and the indubitable truth which is the basis of the theory has not sufficed to protect it from the shafts of ridicule. The 'Book of the Great King of Glory' seems to afford a useful example both of the extent to which the theory may be accepted, and of the limitations under which it should always be applied.</p>

					<p>It must at once be admitted that whether the whole story is based on a sun-story, or whether certain parts or details of it are derived from things first spoken about the sun, or not, it is still essentially Buddhistic. A large proportion of its contents has nothing at all to do with the worship of the sun; and even that which has, had not, in the mind of the author, when the book was put together. Whether indebted to a sun-myth or not, it is therefore perfectly true and valid evidence of the religious belief of the people among whom it was current; and no more shows that the Buddhists were unconscious sun-worshippers than the story of Samson, under any theory of its possible origin, would prove the same of the Jews.</p>

					<p>What we really have is a kind of wonderful fairy tale, a gorgeous poem, in which an attempt is made to describe in set terms, the greatest possible glory and majesty of the greatest possible king, in order to show that all is vanity, save only righteousness-just such a poem as a Jewish prophet might have written of Solomon in all his glory. It would have been most strange, perhaps impossible, for the author to refrain from using the language of the only poets he knew, who had used their boldly figurative language in an attempt to describe the appearance of the sun.</p>

					<p>To trace back all the rhetorical phrases of our Sutta to their earliest appearance in the Vedic hymns would be an interesting task of historical philology, though it would throw more light upon Buddhist forms of speech than upon Buddhist forms of belief. In M. Senart's valuable work, 'La Legende du Bouddha,' he has already done this with regard to the seven treasures (mentioned in the early part of the Suttanta) on the basis of the corresponding passage in the later Buddhist Sanskrit poem called the Lalita Vistara. The description of the royal city and of its wondrous Palace of Righteousness has been probably originated by the author, though on the same lines; and it reminds one irresistibly, in many of its expressions, of the similar, but simpler and more beautiful <a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> poem in which a Jewish author, some three or four centuries afterwards, described the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

					<p>When the Northern Buddhists, long afterwards, had smothered the simple teaching of the founder of their religion under the subtleties of theological and metaphysical speculation, and had forgotten all about the Aryan Path, their goal was no longer a change of heart in the Arahantship to be reached on earth, but a life of happiness, under a change of outward condition, in a heaven of bliss beyond the skies. One of the most popular books among the Buddhists of China and Japan is a description of this heavenly paradise of theirs, called the Sukhavātī-vyūha, the 'Book of the Happy Country.' It is instructive to find that several of the expressions used are word for word the same as the corresponding phrases in our much older 'Book of the Great King of Glory.'</p>

					<p>Incidentally the details given in this Suttanta enable us to judge as to what was considered, at the time when it was put together, to be the greatest possible luxury and glory of the mightiest and most righteous king. In spite of the exuberance of some of the language used, the luxury is after all curiously simple, and mostly of an out-of-door kind. A summary of the conclusions which can be drawn from the sacred books of the Buddhists as to the social and economic condition of the Ganges valley, at the time when those books were composed, will be found in my <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.000.005.contents.htm">'Buddhist India,' ch. IV-VI.</a> The very simple character of the luxury here depicted is in accordance with the evidence there given.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Kusinārā in the Upavattana,<br />
					the Sāla grove of the Mallas,<br />
					between the twin Sāla trees,<br />
					at the time of his death.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now the venerable Ānanda went up to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and bowed down before him,<br />
					and took his seat respectfully on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was so seated,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let not the Exalted One die<br />
					in this little wattle-and­daub town,<br />
					in this town in the midst of the jungle,<br />
					in this branch township.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, lord, there are other great cities,<br />
					such as Champā,<br />
					Rājagaha,<br />
					Sāvatthī,<br />
					Sāketa,<br />
					Kosambī,<br />
					and Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One die in one of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">There there are many wealthy nobles and brahmins<br />
					and heads of houses,<br />
					believers in the Tathāgata,<br />
					who will pay due honour to the remains of the Tathāgata."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Say not so, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Ānanda,<br />
					that this is but a small wattle-and-daub town,<br />
					a town in the midst of the jungle<br />
					a branch township.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long ago, Ānanda, there was a king,<br />
					by name Mahā-Sudassana,<br />
					a king of kings,<br />
					a righteous man who ruled in righteousness,<br />
					an anointed Kshatriya,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Lord of the four quarters <a id="pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a> of the earth,<br />
					conqueror,<br />
					the protector of his people,<br />
					possessor of the seven royal treasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Kusinārā, Ānanda,<br />
					was the royal city of king Mahā-Sudassana,<br />
					under the name of Kusāvati,<br />
					and on the east and on the west<br />
					it was twelve leagues in length,<br />
					and on the north and on the south<br />
					it was seven leagues in breadth.</p>

					<p class="f4">That royal city Kusāvati, Ānanda,<br />
					was mighty,<br />
					and prosperous,<br />
					and full of people,<br />
					crowded with men,<br />
					and provided with all things for food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Ānanda, as the royal city of the gods,<br />
					Āḷakamandā by name,<br />
					is mighty,<br />
					prosperous,<br />
					and full of people,<br />
					crowded with the gods,<br />
					and provided with all kinds of food,<br />
					so, Ānanda, was the royal city Kusāvati<br />
					mighty and prosperous,<br />
					full of people,<br />
					crowded with men,<br />
					and provided with all kinds of food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both by day and by night, Ānanda,<br />
					the royal city Kusāvati resounded with the ten cries;<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the noise of elephants,<br />
					and the noise of horses,<br />
					and the noise of chariots;<br />
					the sounds of the drum,<br />
					of the tabor,<br />
					and of the lute;<br />
					the sound of singing,<br />
					and the sounds of the cymbal<br />
					and of the gong;<br />
					and lastly, with the cry:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Eat, drink, and be merry!'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">4. The royal city Kusāvati, Ānanda,<br />
					was surrounded by Seven Ramparts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these, one rampart was of gold,<br />
					and one of silver,<br />
					and one of beryl,<br />
					and one of crystal,<br />
					and one of agate,<br />
					and one of coral,<br />
					and one of all kinds of gems!</p>

					<p class="f4">5. To the royal city Kusāvati, Ānanda,<br />
					there were Gates of four colours.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gate was of gold,<br />
					and one of silver,<br />
					and one of jade,<br />
					and one of crystal.</p>

					<p class="f4">At each gate seven pillars were fixed;<br />
					in height as three times<br />
					or as four times<br />
					the height of a man.</p>

					<p class="f4">And one pillar was of gold,<br />
					and one of silver,<br />
					and one of beryl,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> 6. The royal city Kusāvati, Ānanda,<br />

					and one of beryl,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Golden Palms had trunks of gold,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Silver Palms had trunks of silver,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Palms of Beryl had trunks of beryl,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Agate Palms had trunks of agate,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Coral Palms had trunks of coral,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Palms of every kind of Gem<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> And when those rows of palm trees, Ānanda,<br />
					were shaken by the wind,<br />
					there arose a sound sweet,<br />

					and charming,<br />
					and intoxicating.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Ānanda, as the seven kinds of instruments yield,<br />
					when well played upon,<br />
					to the skilful man,<br />
					a sound sweet,<br />
					and pleasant,<br />
					and charming,<br />
					and intoxicating —<br />
					just even so, Ānanda,<br />
					when those rows of palm trees were shaken by the wind,<br />
					there arose a sound sweet,<br />
					and pleasant,<br />
					and charming,<br />
					and intoxicating.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whoever, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">7. The Great King of Glory, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">What are those seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, to the Great King of Glory, Ānanda,<br />
					occurred the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, now, I were to establish a perpetual grant<br />
					by the banks of those Lotus-ponds—to wit,<br />
					food for the hungry,<br />
					drink for the thirsty,<br />
					raiment for the naked,<br />
					means of conveyance for those who have need of it,<br />
					couches for the tired,<br />
					wives for those who want wives,<br />
					gold for the poor,<br />
					and money for those who are in want.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory established a perpetual grant<br />
					by the banks of those Lotus-ponds—to wit,<br />
					food for the hungry,<br />
					drink for the thirsty,<br />

					couches for the tired,<br />
					wives for those who want wives,<br />
					gold for the poor,<br />
					and money for those who were in want.</p>

					<p class="f4">24.	Now, Ānanda, the people<br />
					[priests and laymen]<br />
					went to the Great King of Glory,<br />
					taking with them much wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This abundant wealth, O King<br />
					have we brought <a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a> here<br />
					for the use of the King of kings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the King accept it of us!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have enough wealth, my friends,<br />
					laid up for myself,<br />
					the produce of righteous taxation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you keep this,<br />
					and take away more with you!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When those men were thus refused by the King<br />
					they went aside and considered together, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It would not beseem us now,<br />
					were we to take back<br />
					this wealth to our own houses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, now, we were to build a mansion<br />
					for the Great King of Glory.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they went to the Great King of Glory,<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A mansion would we build for thee, O King!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory signified,<br />
					by silence,<br />
					his consent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">25.	'Now, Ānanda, when Sakka, the king of the gods,<br />
					became aware in his mind<br />
					of the thoughts that were in the heart<br />
					of the Great King of Glory,<br />
					he addressed Vissakamma the god, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come now, Vissakamma,<br />
					create me a mansion for the Great King of Glory —<br />
					a palace which shall be called<br />
					"Righteousness"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!' said Vissakamma,<br />
					in assent, Ānanda,<br />
					to Sakka, the king of the gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as instantaneously as a strong man might stretch forth his folded arm,<br />
					or draw in his arm again<br />
					when it was stretched forth,<br />
					so quickly did he vanish<br />
					from the heaven of the Great Thirty-Three,<br />
					and appeared before the Great King of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, Vissakamma the god<br />
					said to the Great King of Glory:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would create for thee, O King, a mansion —<br />
					a palace which shall be called<br />
					"Righteousness!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory<br />
					signified, by silence,<br />
					his consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Vissakamma the god, Ānanda,<br />
					created for the Great King of Glory<br />
					a mansion —<br />
					a palace to be called<br />
					'Righteousness'.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg213"><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></a> 26. The Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">The ground-floor, Ānanda,<br />
					of the Palace of Righteousness,<br />
					in height as three times the height<br />

					<p class="f4">One kind of brick was of gold,<br />

					<p class="f4">To the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">One kind of pillar was of gold,<br />

					<p class="f4">The staircase of gold<br />

					<p class="f4">The staircase of crystal<br />

					<p class="f4">In the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">At the door of the golden chamber<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory<br />
					made a grove of palm trees,<br />
					all of gold,<br />
					at the entrance to the chamber of the Great Complex,<br />
					under the shade of which<br />
					he might pass the heat of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">28.	The Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />
					was surrounded by a double railing.</p>

					<p class="f4">One railing was of gold,<br />
					and one was of silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">The golden railing<br />

					<p class="f4">The silver railing<br />

					<p class="f4">One network of bells was of gold,<br />
					and one was of silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">The golden network<br />
					had bells of silver,<br />
					and the silver network<br />

					<p class="f4">And when those networks of bells, Ānanda,<br />
					were shaken by the wind<br />
					there arose a sound<br />

					and intoxicating.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Ānanda, as the seven kinds of instruments yield,<br />

					a sound<br />
					sweet,<br />
					and pleasant,<br />
					and charming,<br />
					and intoxicating —<br />
					just even so, Ānanda, when those networks of <a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> bells<br />
					were shaken by the wind,<br />
					there arose a sound<br />

					<p class="f4">And whoever, Ānanda, in the royal city Kusāvati<br />

					and given to drink,<br />
					they used to dance round together<br />

					when shaken by the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">30.	When the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was finished<br />
					it was hard to look at,<br />
					destructive to the eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Ānanda,<br />
					as in the last month of the rains<br />
					in the autumn time,<br />
					when the sky has become clear<br />
					and the clouds have vanished away,<br />
					the sun,<br />
					springing up along the heavens,<br />
					is hard to look at,<br />
					and destructive to the eyes —<br />
					just so, Ānanda, when the Palace of Righteousness was finished<br />
					was it hard to look at,<br />
					and destructive to the eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">31.	Now there occurred, Ānanda, to the Great King of Glory this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, now, in front of the Palace of Righteousness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					a league in length,<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">One kind of tile was of gold,<br />

					<p class="f4">The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">One flight of steps was of gold,<br />

					<p class="f4">The flight of crystal steps<br />

					<p class="f4">Round the Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">One railing was of gold,<br />

					<p class="f4">The golden railing<br />

					<p class="f4">The silver railing<br />
					had its posts of silver,<br />
					and its cross bars and its capitals of gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">32. The Lake of Righteousness, Ānanda,<br />
					was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">One row was of palms of gold,<br />
					and one of silver,<br />
					and one of beryl,<br />
					and one of crystal,<br />
					and one of agate,<br />
					and one of coral,<br />
					and one of all kinds of gems.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the golden palms<br />

					<p class="f4">And the silver palms<br />
					had trunks of silver,<br />
					and leaves and fruits of gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the palms of beryl<br />
					had trunks of beryl,<br />
					and leaves and fruits of crystal.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the crystal palms<br />
					had trunks of crystal,<br />
					and leaves and fruits of beryl.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the agate palms<br />
					had trunks of agate,<br />
					and leaves and fruits of coral.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the coral palms<br />
					had trunks of coral,<br />
					and leaves and fruits of agate.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the palms of every kind of gem<br />
					had trunks and leaves and fruits of every kind of gem.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when those rows of palm trees, Ānanda,<br />
					were shaken by the wind,<br />
					there arose a sound<br />

					and charming,<br />
					and intoxicating.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">33.	When the Palace of Righteousness, Ānanda, was <a id="pg217"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span></a> finished,<br />
					and the Lotus-lake of Righteousness was finished,<br />
					the Great King of Glory entertained with all good things<br />
					those of the Wanderers<br />
					who, at that time, were held in high esteem,<br />
					and those of the brahmins<br />
					who, at that time, were held in high esteem.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he ascended up into the Palace of Righteousness."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p><a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a></p>

					<h3 class="ctr c">Chapter II.</h3>

					<p class="f4">1. "Now there occurred, Ānanda, this thought to the Great King of Glory:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of what previous character, now,<br />
					may this be the fruit,<br />
					of what previous character<br />
					the result,<br />
					that I am now so mighty and so great?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then occurred, Ānanda, to the Great King of Glory<br />
					this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of three qualities is this the fruit,<br />
					of three qualities the result,<br />
					that I am now so mighty and so great, —<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					of giving,<br />

					<p class="f4">2. Now the Great King of Glory, Ānanda,<br />
					ascended up into the chamber of the Great Complex;<br />
					and there he broke out into a cry of intense emotion:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Stay here, O thoughts of lust!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay here, O thoughts of ill-will!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay here, O thoughts of hatred!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far only, O thoughts of lust!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far only, O thoughts of ill-will!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus far only, O thoughts of hatred!'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And when, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory<br />
					had entered the chamber of the Great Complex,<br />

					having put away all passion<br />

					he entered into,<br />
					and remained in,<br />
					the First Rapture, —<br />
					a state of joy and ease,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					full of reflection,<br />
					full of investigation.</p>

					<p class="f4">By suppressing reflection and investigation,<br />
					he entered into,<br />
					and remained in,<br />
					the Second Rapture, —<br />
					<a id="pg219"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> a state of joy and ease,<br />
					born of serenity,<br />
					without reflection,<br />
					without investigation,<br />
					a state of elevation of mind,<br />
					of internal calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">By absence of the longing after joy,<br />
					he remained indifferent,<br />
					conscious,<br />
					self-possessed,<br />
					experiencing in his body<br />
					that ease which the noble ones announce, saying: —<br />
					'The man indifferent and self-possessed is well at ease,'<br />
					and thus he entered into,<br />
					and remained in,<br />
					the Third Rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease,<br />
					by putting away pain,<br />
					by the previous dying away<br />
					both of gladness and of sorrow,<br />

					<p class="f4">'O, my friend, the Great Adviser!<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, let the elephants <a id="pg222"><span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span></a> come,<br />
					O my friend, the Great Adviser,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />

					<p class="f4">From that time forth, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Now, Ānanda, after the lapse of many years,<br />
					of many hundred years,<br />
					of many thousand years,<br />
					there occurred to the Queen of Glory this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">''Tis long since I have beheld the Great King of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, now, I were to go and visit the Great King of Gtary.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory<br />
					said to the women of the harem:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arise now,<br />
					dress your hair,<br />
					and clothe yourselves in fresh raiment.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis long since we have beheld<br />
					the Great King of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go and visit<br />
					the Great King of Glory!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lady!'<br />
					said the women of the harem, Ānanda,<br />
					in assent,<br />
					to the Queen of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they dressed their hair,<br />
					and clad themselves in fresh raiment,<br />
					and came near to the Queen of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory<br />
					said to the Great Adviser:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arrange, O Great Adviser,<br />
					the fourfold army in array.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis long since I have beheld<br />
					the Great King of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am about to go to visit<br />
					the Great King of Glory.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, O Queen!'<br />
					said the Great Adviser, Ānanda,<br />
					in assent,<br />
					to the Queen of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he set the fourfold army in array,<br />
					and had the fact announced to the Queen of Glory<br />
					in the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The fourfold army, O Queen,<br />
					is set for thee in array.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do now whatever seemeth to thee fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then, Ānanda, the Queen of Glory,<br />
					with the fourfold army,<br />
					repaired,<br />
					with the women of the harem,<br />
					to the Palace of Righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when she <a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> had arrived there<br />
					she mounted up into the Palace of Righteousness,<br />
					and went on to the chamber of the Great Complex.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when she had reached it,<br />
					she stopped and leant against the side of the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory<br />
					heard the noise<br />
					he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, now, may this noise,<br />
					as of a great multitude of people, mean?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And going out from the chamber of the Great Complex,<br />
					he beheld the Queen of Glory<br />
					standing leaning up against the side of the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he beheld her, he said to the Queen of Glory:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Stop there, O Queen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Enter not!'</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Then the Great King of Glory, Ānanda,<br />
					said to one of his attendants:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arise, good man!<br />
					take the golden couch<br />
					out of the chamber of the Great Complex,<br />
					and make it ready<br />
					under that grove of palm trees<br />
					which is all of gold.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord!'<br />
					said the man, in assent,<br />
					to the Great King of Glory.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he took the golden couch<br />
					out of the chamber of the Great Complex,<br />
					and made it ready<br />
					under that grove of palm trees<br />
					which was all of gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, the Great King of Glory<br />
					laid himself down<br />
					in the dignified way a lion does;<br />
					and lay with one leg resting on the other,<br />
					calm and self-possessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">10.	Then, Ānanda, there occurred<br />
					to the Queen of Glory<br />
					this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How calm are all the limbs of the Great King of Glory!</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in1" href="#ifn1">i1</a>]</sup> It is not easy with our present materials to reconcile the apparently conflicting statements with regard to the Buddha's last journey. According to the <i>Mālālaṇkāra-vatthu</i> this refers here to a residence at the Jetavana, which took place between the end of § 23 in Chap. II in <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.16.rhyt.pts.htm">the Book of the Great Decease,</a> and the beginning of § 24.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Mr. Fausböll, by his punctuation, includes these words in the following thought ascribed to the Exalted One, but I think they only describe the time at which the thought is supposed to have arisen.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in2" href="#ifn2">i2</a>]</sup> The text reads 'at Varaka.' But this is a mistake. The word which has puzzled Mr. Fausböll is <i>ovaraka.</i> The modem name of the village, afterwards the site of the famous Buddhist university of Nālanda, is Baragaon. The full-moon day in Kattika is the first of December. An account of the death of Sariputta will be found in the <i>Mālālaṇkāra-vatthu</i> (Bigandet, 'Legend,' etc., 3rd ed., II, 1-25), and of the murder of Moggallāna by the Niganthas in the <i>Dhammapada commentary</i> (Fausböll, p. 298 seq.), of which Spence Hardy's account (<a href="../../../resources/pdf/hardy/hardy-manual-budhism.pdf"><i>'Manual of Buddhism,'</i></a> p. 338) is nearly a translation; and Bigandet's account (loc. cit., pp. 25-7) is an abridgement.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in3" href="#ifn3">i3</a>]</sup> In the earliest description of this conversation (above, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.16.rhyt.pts.htm">'Book of the Great Decease,'</a> V, 17) there is no mention of this. But it is inserted most incongruously in the present Suttanta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in4" href="#ifn4">i4</a>]</sup> Both these speeches are different from those given on the same occasion in the Suttanta below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in5" href="#ifn5">i5</a>]</sup> This question and answer are not in the Suttanta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in6" href="#ifn6">i6</a>]</sup> All this is omitted in the Suttanta. It is true the verse occurs there, but it is placed in the mouth of the Teacher, after the account of Mahā-Sudassana's death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="in18" href="#ifn18">i18</a>]</sup> This paragraph, too, is omitted in the Suttanta.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>'Sudassana'</i> means 'beautiful to see, having a glorious appearance,' and is the name of many kings and heroes in Indian legend.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Khattiyo muddhāvasitto,</i> which does not occur in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16"><i>Mahā-parinibbāna,</i></a> the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14"><i>Mahāpadāna,</i></a> and the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p30"><i>Lakkhaṇa</i></a> Suttantas, and other places where this stock description of a king of kings is found. It is omitted also in the <i>Lalita Vistara.</i> The Burmese Phayre MS. of the India Office reads here <i>muddābhisitto,</i> but this is an unnecessary correction. The epithet is probably inserted here from § 7 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This enumeration is found also at <i>Jātaka</i> I, 3, only that the chank is added there — wrongly, for that makes the number of cries eleven.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> This section should be compared with one in the <i>Sukhāvatīvyūha,</i> translated by Professor Max Müller as follows (<i>'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,'</i> 1880, p. 170): —<br />
					<i>'And again, O Sāriputra, when those rows of palm trees and strings of bells in that Buddha country are moved by the wind, a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds from them. Yes, O Sāriputra, as from a heavenly musical instrument consisting of a hundred thousand kotis of sounds, when played by Aryas, a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds; a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds from those rows of palm trees and strings of bells moved by the wind.<br />
					'And when the men there hear that sound, reflection on Buddha arises in their body, reflection on the Law, reflection on the Assembly.'</i><br />
					Compare also below, § 32, and <i>Jātaka</i> I, 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The following enumeration is found word for word in several other Pāli Suttas, and occurs also, in almost identical terms, in the <i>Lalita Vistara</i> (Calcutta edition, pp. 14-19).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Uposatha,</i> a weekly sacred day; being full-moon day, new-moon day, and the two equidistant intermediate days. Comp. § 12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This is the disk of the sun.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> A king of the rolling wheel.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Yathābhuttam bhuñjatha.</i> Buddhaghosa has no comment on this. I suppose it means, 'Observe the rules current among you regarding clean and unclean meats.' If so, the Great King of Glory disregards the teaching of the <i>Āmagandha Sutta</i> (translated in my <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_buddhism.pdf"><i>'Buddhism,'</i></a> p. 131).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Hatthi-ratana.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Satta-p-patittho,</i> that is, perhaps, in regard to its four legs, two tusks, and trunk. The expression is curious, and Buddhaghosa has no note upon it. It is quite possible that it merely signifies 'exceeding firm,' the number seven being used without any hard and fast interpretation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Uposatho.</i> In the <i>Lalita Vistara</i> its name is 'Wisdom' <i>(Bodhi). Uposatha</i> is the name for the sacred day of the moon's changes — first, and more especially the full-moon day; next, the new-moon day; and lastly, the days equidistant between these two. It was, therefore, a weekly sacred day, and, as Childers says, may often be well rendered 'Sabbath.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Compare on this and § 29 my <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_birth-stories.pdf"><i>"Buddhist Birth Stories.'</i></a> p. 85, where a similar phrase is used of Kanthaka.</p>

In the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_32_valahakasamyutta.htm"><i>Valāhaka Saṃyutta</i></a> of the <i>Saṃyutta Nikāya</i> the spirits of the skies are divided into <i>Uṇha-valāhaka Devā, Sīta-valāhaka Devā, Abbha-valāhaka Devā, Vāta-valāhaka Devā,</i> and <i>Vassa-valāhaka Devā,</i> that is, the cloud-spirits of cold, heat, air, wind, and rain respectively.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The above description of an ideally beautiful woman is of frequent occurrence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Gahapati-ratanaṃ.</i> The word <i>gahapati</i> has been hitherto usually rendered 'householder,' but this may often, and would certainly here, convey a wrong impression. There is no single word in English which is an adequate rendering of the term, for it connotes a social condition now no longer known among us. The <i>gahapati</i> was the head of a family, the representative in a village community of a family, the <i>pater familias.</i> So the god of fire, with allusion to the sacred fire maintained in each household, is called in the <i>Rig-veda</i> the <i>g</i>ri<i>hapati,</i> the <i>pater familias,</i> of the human race. It is often used in opposition to <i>brāhmaṇa</i> very much as we used 'yeoman' in opposition to 'clerk' (<i>Jātaka</i> I, 83); and the two combined are used in opposition to people of other ranks and callings held to be less honourable than that of clerk or yeoman <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_37">(<i>Jātaka</i> I, 218).</a> The compound <i>brāhmaṇa-gahapatika</i> as a collective term comes to be about equivalent to 'priests and laymen' (see, for instance, below, § 21, and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/vp/idx_vinaya.pitaka.htm"><i>Vinaya</i></a> I, 35, 36). Then again the <i>gahapati</i> is distinct from the subordinate members of the family, who had not the control and management of the common property (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2"><i>Sāmañña Phala Suttanta</i></a> 133, = <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p13"><i>Tevijja Suttanta</i></a> I, 47); and it is this implication of the term that is emphasized in the text. Buddhaghosa uses, as an explanatory phrase, the words <i>seṭṭhi-gahapati.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> <i>Pariṇāyaka-ratanaṃ.</i> Buddhaghosa says that he was the eldest son of the king. The <i>Lalita Vistara</i> makes him a general.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/cattari_iddhipada.htm">The Four <i>Iddhis.</i></a> Here again, as elsewhere, it will be noticed that there is nothing supernatural about these four <i>Iddhis.</i> See the passages quoted above, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.11.rhyt.pts.htm#pg272">Vol. I, pp. 272 foll.</a> They are merely attributes accompanying or forming part of the majesty <i>(iddhi)</i> of the King of kings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> The same thing is said of Raṭṭhapāla in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p82"><i>Raṭṭhapāla Sutta</i>,</a> where Gogerly renders the whole passage: — 'Raṭṭhapāla is healthy, free from pain, having a good digestion and appetite, being troubled with no excess of either heat or cold' (<i>'Journal of the Ceylon Asiatic Society,'</i> 1847-8, p. 98). The <i>gahaṇi</i> is a supposed particular organ or function situate at the junction of the stomach and intestines. Moggallāna explains it, <i>udare tu tathā pācanalasmiṃ gahaṇi</i> (<i>Abhidhāna-p-padīpikā</i> 972), where Subhūti's Sinhalese version is <i>'kukshi, pākāgni,'</i> and his English version, 'the belly, the internal fire which promotes digestion.' Buddhaghosa explains <i>samavipākiyā kammaga-tejo-dhātuyā,</i> and adds: — 'If a man's food is dissolved the moment he has eaten it, or if it remains like a lump, he has not the <i>samavepākini gahaṇi,</i> but he who has appetite <i>(bhattacchando)</i> when the time for food comes round again, he has the <i>samavepākini gahaṇi,'</i> — which is delightfully naive.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup>  <i>Pokkharaṇi,</i> the word translated Lotus-pond, is an artificial pool or small lake for water-plants. There are some which are probably nearly as old as this passage still in good preservation in Anurādhapura in Ceylon. Each is oblong, and has its tiles and its four flights of steps, and some had railings. The balustrades, cross bars, figure-head, and railings are in Pāli <i>thambha, sūciyo, unhīsa,</i> and <i>vedikā,</i> of the exact meaning of which I am not quite confident. They do not occur in the description of the Lotus-lakes in Sukhāvatī. General Cunningham says that the cross bars of the Buddhist railings are called <i>sūciyo</i> in the inscriptions at Bharahat ('The Stupa of Bharhut,' p. 127). Buddhaghosa, who is good enough to tell us the exact number of the ponds — to wit, 84,000, has no explanation of these words, merely saying that of the two <i>vedikās</i> one was at the limit of the tiles and one at the limit of the <i>pariveṇa.</i> See below §31; and Rhys Davids, <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.005.town.htm#pg74">'Buddhist India,' Figures 6, 7; pp. 74-6.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> I have here translated <i>kamma</i> by 'previous character' and by 'quality.' The easiest plan would, no doubt, have been to preserve in the translation the technical term <i>karma,</i> which is explained at some length in <a href="../../../resources/pdf/tw_rhys-davids/rhys-davids_buddhism.pdf"><i>'Buddhism,'</i></a> pp. 99-106.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> The above paragraphs are an endeavour to express the inmost feelings when they are first strung to the uttermost by the intense effects of deep religious emotion, and then feel the effects of what may be called, for want of a better word, the reaction. Most deeply religious natures have passed through such a crisis; and though the feelings are perhaps really indescribable, this passage is dealing, not with a vain mockery, but with a very real event in spiritual experience. It implies neither hypnotism nor trance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> These are the four <i>Appamaññas</i> or infinite feelings, also called (e.g. below, § 13) the four <i>Brahma-vihāras</i> or Sublime Conditions. They are here very appropriately represented to follow immediately after the state of feeling described in the Raptures; but they ought to be the constant companions of a good Buddhist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>Subhaddā Devī. Subhaddā,</i> 'glorious, magnificent,' is a not uncommon name both for men and women in Buddhist and post-Buddhistic Hindu literature.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> The whole of this conversation between the Great King of Glory and the Queen is very much shorter in the <i>Jātaka.</i> This may be perhaps partly explained by the narrative style in which the stories are composed — a style incompatible with the repetitions of the Suttas, and confined to the facts of the story.<br />
					But I think that no one can read this Suttanta in comparison with the short passage found in the <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.16.rhyt.pts.htm#ch5"><i>'Book of the Great Decease'</i> (above, Chap.
