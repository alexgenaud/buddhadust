					<p class="f4">1. At one time the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nāḷandā</a> in the Pāvārika Mango Wood<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> came to the place where the Exalted One was,<br />
					and having saluted him,<br />
					took his seat respectfully at his side<br />

					<p class="f4">"Lord! such faith have I in the Exalted One,<br />
					that methinks there never has been,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Grand and bold<br />

					<p class="f4">Thou hast roared<br />
					a veritable lion's roar<br />
					in this that thou hast said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of course then<br />
					thou hast known all the Exalted Ones<br />
					who in the long ages of the past<br />
					have been Arahants,<br />
					Awakened Ones,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of course then<br />

					<p class="f4">"Not so, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lo! here, Sāriputta,<br />

					<p class="f4">Why then forsooth<br />

					<p class="f4">2. "Lord! no knowledge have I<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as a king, lord,<br />

					strong in its ramparts and towers,<br />
					and with only one gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there might be a warden of the gate,<br />
					discreet and clever and wise,<br />
					to stop all strangers<br />
					and admit only them that were known.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he,<br />
					on patrolling in his sentry-walks<br />
					over the approaches all round the city,<br />
					might not so observe<br />
					all the joints and crevices<br />
					in the ramparts of that city<br />
					as to know where anything as small as a cat<br />
					could get past.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever bulkier creatures<br />
					either enter or leave this city,<br />
					they all pass only by this gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only thus is it, lord,<br />
					that I know the lineage of the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">They who in the long ages of the past<br />
					were Arahants,<br />
					Supremely Awakened Ones,<br />
					putting away the five Hindrances,<br />
					suppressing the corruptions of the mind by wisdom,<br />
					with hearts well established<br />
					in the four exercises for setting up mindfulness,<br />

					in the seven branches of enlightenment,<br />
					have wholly awaked to the uttermost awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">They who in the long ages of the future<br />
					will be Arahants,<br />
					<a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> Supremely Awakened Ones,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One too,<br />
					who now, lord,<br />
					is Arahant Supremely Awakened,<br />
					he too hath done likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">It<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> happened one day, lord,<br />
					that I had come to the Exalted One<br />
					to listen to the exposition of the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One taught me doctrine,<br />
					each point ever more excellent than the last,<br />
					with comparison of the things of light<br />
					and the things of darkness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now while the Exalted One<br />
					was teaching me the Norm, after this sort,<br />
					even so I,<br />

					one certain doctrine,<br />
					namely,<br />

					<p class="f4">And I confessed in my heart:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One is supremely awakened;<br />
					well taught by him is the Norm;<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3">3.</a> Moreover, lord, this too is unsurpassed:<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, one descends into the mother's womb, knowing,<br />

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>"without attention applied on occasion of sense" is "api ca kho avitakkaɱ avicāraɱ" that is, 'without thinking, without pondering' or the second <i>jhāna</i> where, because one is, one's self, no longer thinking, the thoughts of others are perceptible without confusion. This is not really 'intuitive' knowledge, it is knowing as in the normal form of knowing and is described by those who have had the experience in terms of 'hearing'. "First comes muttering to one's self, then one utters speech." Thoughts formed with words, and the formation of words in the mind is accompanied by their formation as vibrations in the body and is a form of speech which can be over-heard. The first form of thought reading is closer to intuitive knowledge — the seeing of the formation of thought originating in sensation and mental state in the features of an individual and knowing the thought from recognizing the experience.</p>

					unworthy,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus asked, I should say No.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, if I were asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why does the venerable Sāriputta<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus asked, I should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the presence of the Exalted One<br />

					and from him have received,<br />

					<p class="f4">Should I be stating doctrine<br />

					and would no orthodox disputant<br />
					find occasion for blame herein?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth, Sāriputta, hadst thou been asked such questions<br />

					<p class="f4">Thou hast stated doctrine<br />

					<p class="f4">20. When they had thus spoken,<br />
					the venerable <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/udayin.htm">Udayin</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, lord,<br />

					is it to behold how self-contained,<br />

					and resigned<br />
					is the Tathāgata,<br />

					will not proclaim himself!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If any Wanderers of independent doctrines<br />
					were to discern in themselves<br />

					they would flourish around a banner because of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, marvellous is it<br />
					to behold how self-contained,<br />
					serene<br />
					and resigned<br />
					is the Tathāgata,<br />
					when he who is so mighty and powerful<br />

					<p class="f4">"Take note of this then, Udayin,<br />
					that this is so;<br />
					and that if Wanderers teaching independent doctrines<br />
					were to discern in themselves<br />
					even one such quality,<br />
					they would flourish around a banner about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take note of this."</p>

					<p class="f4">21. Then the Exalted One addressed the venerable Sāriputta: —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore thou, Sāriputta,<br />
					shouldst often discourse on this matter<br />
					to both brethren and sisters,<br />
					laymen and lay sisters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever foolish ones there be<br />
					who will feel doubt and hesitation concerning the Tathāgata,<br />
					when they have heard such discourse,<br />
					even they too will banish their hesitation and their doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">On this wise did the venerable Sāriputta make known his faith before the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence the title The Faith that Satisfied is another name for his confession.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Pasidi.</i> There is no English word that quite fits this or its variants <i>pasādo, pasanno.</i> They are expressions of the satisfaction akin to aesthetic gratification (<i>Cf.</i> <i>B.P.E</i> 174, <i>n.</i> 3) felt by the believer in whom faith, confidence, amounts to a passion, akin to religious love.</p>

Buddhaghosa distinguishes under <i>kusala</i> the <i>Jātaka</i> meaning of that which makes for well-being <i>(ārogya),</i> as taught by common sense, the Suttanta meaning or what is ethically right <i>(anavajja),</i> as here; and the <i>Ahhidhamma</i> meaning, as that which is efficient <i>(kosa11a),</i> makes for absence of pain <i>(niddaratha),</i> for happy results <i>(sukha vipāka).</i> <i>Cf.</i> The <i>Expositor</i>, pp. 48 f.; 83.</p>

In the third mode, the sound is some remark overheard, made by persons chattering or drowsy with sleep. <i>Comy.</i>, <i>cf.</i> <i>Points of Controversy,</i> 239, § 9.</p>
