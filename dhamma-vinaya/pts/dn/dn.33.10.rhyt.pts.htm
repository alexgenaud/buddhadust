Those doctrines which, excellent at the start, in the middle, at the end, in the letter and in their contents, declare the absolutely perfect and pure religious life, these he learns to a great extent bears them in mind, treasures them by repetition, onders them in mind, penetrates them by intuition.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					(5) Where there are duties to be done for the seniors among his fellow-disciples, he therein is industrious, not slothful, and exercises forethought in methods for discharging them, is capable of accomplishing, capable of organizing.<br />
					(6) And furthermore, friends, he loves the doctrine, the utterance of it is dear to him,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> he finds exceeding joy in the advanced teaching of both Doctrine and Discipline.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />

					(8) Furthermore, friends, he is continually stirring up effort to eliminate bad qualities, evoke good qualities, making dogged and vigorous progress in good things, never throwing off the burden.<br />
					(9) Furthermore, friends, he is mindful, <a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a> and possessed of supreme lucidity and perspicacity in following mentally and recollecting deeds and words long past.<br />
					(10) Furthermore,friends, he is intelligent, endowed with insight into the rise and passing away [of things], insight which is of that Ariyan penetration which leads to the complete destruction of pain.</p>

					(7) How is he candid in his thoughts? He has eliminated occupying his mind with sensual or malicious or cruel ideas.<br />
					(8) How does he tranquillize the activity of the body? Because of eliminating the being affected pleasurably or painfully, because of the dying out of previous impressions as joyful or sorrowful, he attains to and abides in a state of neutral feeling, of very pure indifference and mental lucidity, namely, the state called Fourth Jhāna.<br />
					(9) How does he become well emancipated in heart?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> He becomes emancipated in heart from passion, hate, and illusion.<br />
					(10) How does he become well emancipated in intellect?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> He understands his emancipated condition, namely, in the thought: Passion ... hate ... illusion ... for me are eliminated, cut off at the root, become as a palmtree stump, become non-existent, unable to grow again in future.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Lit. protector-making. For (1) cf. <a href="dn.13.rhyt.pts.htm#p42">Dial.I, 317</a>. 'Self-control prescribed,'etc., is pātimokkha-saɱvara.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See Vin. Texts III, 50, on these qualifications for a bhikkhu juryman, and the footnote.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Piya-samudāhāro, concerning which term Childers was doubtful, is thus expanded by B.: 'he listens intently (sakkaccaɱ) when another discourses and longs to teach others.' Cf. Mil. II, 237.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Abhidhamme Abhivinaye. B., by alternative exegeses, shows these terms are used vaguely, The former may mean the third Piṭake(?), or the doctrine of the Paths and Fruits. The latter may mean the Khandhaka-Parivāra, or the <i>end</i> of the vinaya--self-mastery. Cf. Sumagala Vilāsinī I, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Kasiṇa,</i> 'in the sense of <i>entire</i> (sakala).' Comy. Cf. Bud. Ps. Eth., pp. 43 f., <i>n.</i> 4; 57 f., <i>n.</i> 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> On the varying number of these 'objects' in Buddhist literature see B.P.E., p.57, n.2. Buddhaghosa also comments thereon in The Expositor, p. 249 f., but not here, nor in the Visuddhimagga, though he refers to fuller treatment there. There he drops the 'consciousness' object altogether, substituting āloka, or brightness. He identifies the former with the second of the <a href="dn.33.08.rhyt.pts.htm#p8.11">Eight Deliverances</a> (or second <a href="dn.33.04.rhyt.pts.htm#p4.7">Arūpa-jhāna</a>). See above (mo: follow links).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Kindred Sayings I, 124</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Cf. <a href="dn.33.04.rhyt.pts.htm#p4.8">above, 216, viii</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> A curious use of <i>sacca</i> (fact or truth). 'This view, that view is true! Thus <i>pātiyekkam gahitāni</i> ..." Comy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Cf. <a href="dn.33.03.rhyt.pts.htm#p3.22">above, p. 209, xxii</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>] [<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> The distinctive replies given in the case of citta and paññā should be noted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> This No. v., which is a Sutta in the Aŋguttara (v., 29), is presumably the Ariya-vasāni, one of the five Dhamma-teachings recommended for study in Asoka's Bhabra edict. Cf. Rh. Davids, Buddhist India, 169.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> That is, these factors in their case are 'connected with fruition.' The 'views' and 'insight' are understanding (or intellect, paññā) exercised on two sorts of occasion (ṭhāna). To avoid multiplying footnotes, references have not been given to all the parallels in the other Nikāyas, of the foregoing summarized doctrines. References, especially to one Nikāya, the Aŋguttara, will be found in Dr. J.E. Carpenters edition of the text.</p>
