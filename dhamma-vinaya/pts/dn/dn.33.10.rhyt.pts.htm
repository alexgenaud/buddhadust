					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Piya-samudāhāro,</i> concerning which term Childers was doubtful, is thus expanded by B.: 'he listens intently <i>(sakkaccaɱ)</i> when another discourses and longs to teach others.' <i>Cf.</i><i> Mil.</i> II, 237.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Abhidhamme Abhivinaye.</i> B., by alternative exegeses, shows these terms are used vaguely, The former may mean the third <i>Piṭake</i>(?), or the doctrine of the Paths and Fruits. The latter may mean the <i>Khandhaka-Parivāra,</i> or the <i>end</i> of the <i>vinaya</i> — self-mastery. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sumagala Vilāsinī</i> I, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Kasiṇa,</i> 'in the sense of <i>entire</i> <i>(sakala).</i>' <i>Comy. Cf.</i> <i>Bud. Ps. Eth.,</i> pp. 43 f., <i>n.</i> 4; 57 f., <i>n.</i> 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> On the varying number of these 'objects' in Buddhist literature see <i>B.P.E.,</i> p.57, n.2. Buddhaghosa also comments thereon in <i>The Expositor,</i> p. 249 f., but not here, nor in the <i>Visuddhimagga,</i> though he refers to fuller treatment there. There he drops the 'consciousness' object altogether, substituting <i>āloka,</i> or brightness. He identifies the former with the second of the <a href="dn.33.08.rhyt.pts.htm#p8.11">Eight Deliverances</a> (or second <a href="dn.33.04.rhyt.pts.htm#p4.7">Arūpa-jhāna</a>). See above.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> This No. v., which is a Sutta in the <i>Aṅguttara</i> (v., 29), is presumably the <i>Ariya-vasāni,</i> one of the five Dhamma-teachings recommended for study in Asoka's Bhabra edict. <i>Cf.</i> Rh. Davids, <a href="../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.010.literature.htm#pg169"><i>Buddhist India,</i> 169.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> That is, these factors in their case are 'connected with fruition.' The 'views' and 'insight' are understanding (or intellect, <i>paññā</i>) exercised on two sorts of occasion <i>(ṭhāna).</i> To avoid multiplying footnotes, references have not been given to all the parallels in the other <i>Nikāyas,</i> of the foregoing summarized doctrines.
