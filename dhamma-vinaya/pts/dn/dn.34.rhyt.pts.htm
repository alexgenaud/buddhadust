This sutta is very similar to DN 33 in that it is a catalog of various units of the Dhamma organized by way of the number of items in the unit. It becomes a form of mental gymnastics by imposing on the structure that it be limited to ten sets fit within 10 specific concepts: — so that section 1 is 10 units of one item each, each dealing with concepts 1-10; the second is 10 units of 2 items each, each dealing with concepts 1-10; on up to 10 units of 10 items each, each dealing with concepts 1-10.">

					<span class="f2">(1)</span> Herein, friends, when a brother's kindly act towards his fellow-disciples has been attested,<br />
					as wrought publicly and in private,<br />
					that is an occasion of fraternity,<br />
					causing affection and regard,<br />
					and conducing to concord,<br />
					absence of strife, harmony, union.<br />
					<span class="f2">(2-3)</span> The second and third occasions are those of kindly speech and kind thoughts.<br />
					<span class="f2">(4)</span> In the next place,<br />
					when a brother who has honestly and righteously obtained gifts,<br />
					distributes these impartially among his fellow-disciples,<br />
					and has everything in common with them,<br />
					even to the contents of his alms-bowl,<br />
					that is an occasion of fraternity, etc.<br />
					<span class="f2">(5)</span> Next, when the character and moral habits of a brother are without rupture or flaw,<br />
					are consistently practised,<br />
					unblemished,<br />
					making a man free,<br />
					commended by the wise,<br />
					unperverted,<br />
					and conducing to rapt concentration,<br />

					that is an occasion of fraternity,<br />
					causing affection and regard,<br />
					and conducing to concord,<br />
					absence of strife,<br />
					harmony, union.<br />
					<span class="f2">(6)</span> Lastly, when a brother lives with his religious life [guided by] that Ariyan,<br />

					which leads him who so lives to the perfect destruction of sorrow,<br />
					— when he thus equipped lives among his fellow-disciples publicly and in private,<br />

					<p class="f4">ii. <i>Which Six are to be developed?</i></p>

					renunciation,<br />
					the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">iii. <i>Which Six are to be understood?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The six (organs of

					or to his studies,<br />
					or lacks in reverence and respect towards the duties of courtesy.</p>

					<p class="f4">vi. <i>Which Six belong to distinction?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The six forms of reverence, to wit,<br />
					Herein, friends, a brother conducts himself in the opposite manner in the foregoing six cases.</p>

					<p class="f4">vii. <i>Which Six are hard to penetrate?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The six elements tending to deliverance, to wit,<br />
					<span class="f2">(1)</span> Herein, friends, a brother might say:<br />
					'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation by love,<br />
					I have multiplied it, made it a vehicle, and a base.<br />
					I have brought it out,<br />
					accumulated and set it well going.<br />
					Nevertheless malevolence persistently possesses my heart.'<br />
					To him it should be said:<br />
					'Not so! Say not so, your reverence!<br />
					Do not misrepresent the Exalted One!<br />
					It is not well to calumniate the Exalted One!<br />
					Surely he would not say this was so!<br />
					This is a baseless and uncalled-for statement, friend.<br />
					Things cannot be as you say.<br />
					Emancipation of the heart through love, brother,<br />
					this is how you become delivered from malevolence.<br />
					<span class="f2">(2-4)</span> In the same way a brother might wrongly complain that after cultivating emancipation of the heart through pity,<br />
					he was still possessed by cruelty,<br />
					or that after cultivating emancipation of the heart through sympathetic joy,<br />
					or through equanimity,<br />
					he was still possessed by disgust,<br />
					and passion respectively.<br />
					<span class="f2">(5)</span> Next, friends, a brother might say:<br />
					'Lo! I have developed mental emancipation<br />
					from the power of any object<br />
					to catch the fancy and incite lust,<br />
					I have multiplied that emancipation,<br />
					made it a vehicle and a base I have brought it out,<br />
					accumulated and set it well going.<br />
					Nevertheless my mind still pursues seductive objects.<br />
					<span class="f2">(6)</span> Or again he may say:<br />
					'Lo! the notion "I am" is offensive to me!<br />
					I pay no heed to the notion "This 'I' exists!"<br />
					Nevertheless doubts and queries and debating<br />
					still possess my mind.'<br />
					To these answer should be made as before.<br />
					He should be assured that such cannot really be the case;<br />
					that it is by emancipating the heart through equanimity,<br />
					or again, through the expulsion of the conceit of the existence of an 'I,'<br />
					that he becomes delivered from lust<br />
					and from doubts and queries and debatings.</p>

					<p class="f4">— being one he becomes many,<br />

					he becomes visible or invisible;<br />
					he goes, feeling no obstruction,<br />
					to the further side of a wall or rampart or hill,<br />
					as if through air;<br />
					he penetrates up and down through solid ground,<br />
					as if through water;<br />
					he walks on water without breaking through,<br />
					as if on solid ground;<br />
					he travels cross-legged in the sky,<br />
					like the birds on wing;<br />
					even the Moon and the Sun,<br />
					so potent, so mighty though they be,<br />
					does he touch and feel with his hand;<br />
					he reaches in the body<br />
					even up to the heaven of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">(2)</span> With that clear Heavenly Ear<br />
					surpassing the ear of men<br />
					he hears sounds both human and celestial,<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">(3)</span> Penetrating with his own heart<br />
					the hearts of other beings, of other men,<br />

					and the lofty mind lofty;<br />
					the stedfast mind to be stedfast,<br />

					or two or three or four or five births,<br />
					or ten or twenty or thirty or forty or fifty<br />
					or a hundred or a thousand<br />
					or a hundred thousand births,<br />
					through many an aeon of dissolution,<br />
					many an aeon of evolution,<br />
					many an aeon of both dissolution and evolution.<br />
					"In such a place such was my name,<br />
					such my family,<br />
					such my caste,<br />
					such my food,<br />
					such my experience of discomfort or of ease,<br />
					and such the limits of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed away from that state,<br />

					There I had such and such a name<br />
					and family<br />
					and caste<br />
					and food<br />
					and experience of discomfort or of ease,<br />
					such was the limit of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed away from that state<br />
					I took form again here."<br />
					— thus does he call to mind<br />
					his temporary states in days gone by<br />
					in all their details,<br />
					and in all their modes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">(5)</span> With the pure Heavenly Eye,<br />
					surpassing that of men,<br />
					he sees beings as they pass away<br />
					from one form of existence<br />
					and take shape in another;<br />
					he recognises the mean and the noble,<br />
					the well favoured and the ill favoured,<br />
					the happy and the wretched,<br />
					passing away according to their deeds:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such and such beings, my brethren,<br />
					evil-doers in act and word and thought,<br />
					revilers of the noble ones,<br />
					holding to wrong views,<br />
					acquiring for themselves that Karma<br />
					which results from wrong views,<br />
					they, on the dissolution of the body, after death,<br />
					are reborn in some unhappy state of suffering or woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">But such and such beings, my brethren,<br />
					well-doers in act and word and thought,<br />
					not revilers of the noble ones,<br />
					holding to right views,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus with the pure Heavenly Eye,<br />

					he recognises the mean and the noble,<br />
					the well favoured and the ill favoured,<br />
					the happy and the wretched,<br />
					passing away according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">(6)</span> he lives in the attainment, the personal knowledge and realization, through the extinction of the intoxicants, of sane and immune freedom of heart and mind.</p>
