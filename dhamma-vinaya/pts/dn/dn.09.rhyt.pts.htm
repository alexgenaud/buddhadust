					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Poṭṭhapāda Sutta</b></h4>

					<p>This Sutta, beginning with a discussion on the mystery of trance, passes over, by a natural transition, or association of ideas, to the question of soul. For trance (as is pointed out by Poṭṭhapāda in § 6) had been explained by adherents of the soul theory as produced by the supposed fact of a 'soul' having gone away out of the body.</p>

					<p>As is well known, this hypothesis of a soul inside the body has been adopted, and no doubt quite independently, among so many different peoples in all parts of the world that it may fairly be described as almost universal. It is even by no means certain that it has not been quite universal; in which case its adoption is probably a necessary result of the methods of thought possible to men in early times. But it is, unfortunately, very easy for us, who now no longer use the word 'soul' exclusively in its original sense, to misunderstand the ancient view, and to import into it modern conceptions<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>. The oldest and simplest form of the hypothesis was frankly materialistic. The notion was that of a double — shadowy, no doubt, and impalpable — but still a physical double of the physical body; and made up, like the body, of the four elements.</p>

					<p>When the 'soul' was away the body lay still, without moving, apparently without life, in trance. or disease, or sleep. When the 'soul' came back, motion began again, and life. Endless were the corollaries of a theory which, however devoid of the essential marks of a sound scientific hypothesis, underlies every variety of early speculation in India, as elsewhere.</p>

					<p>Long before the date of the earliest records of Indian belief this theory, among the ancestors of the men to whom we owe those records, had gone through a whole course of development of which the Vedas show us only the results. They take the theory so completely for granted that the <a id="pg242"><span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span></a> details of it, as they held it, are nowhere set out in full, or in any detail. The hypothesis having been handed down from time immemorial, and being accepted by all, it was considered amply sufficient to refer to it in vague and indirect phraseology<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>. And the stage which the theory had reached before the time when our Sutta was composed can only be pieced together imperfectly from incidental references in the Upanishads.</p>

					<p>I have collected these references together in the article already referred to (J.R.A.S., 1899), and need here only state the result. This is that the Upanishads show how the whole theory of the priests, as there set out, is throughout based on this old theory of a soul inside the body. The numerous details are full of inconsistencies, more especially on the point, so important to theologians, as to what happens to the soul after it flies away from the body. But not one of these inconsistent views leaves for a moment the basis of the soul theory. That is always taken for granted. And the different views set out in these priestly manuals by no means exhaust the list of speculations about the soul that must have been current in India when Buddhism arose, and when our Sutta was composed. There were almost certainly other views, allied to one or other of the thirty-two theories controverted above (pp. 44, 45), A careful search would no doubt reveal passages, even in the later priestly literature itself, acknowledging views which do not happen to be referred to in the Upanishads, but which bear the stamp of great antiquity — such passages as Mahābhārata XII, 11704, where we are told that if the soul, in departing from the body goes out by way of the knees, it will go to the Sādhyas.</p>

					<p>However, that may be, it is certain that all the religions, and all the philosophies, the existing records show to have existed in India, in the time when Buddhism arose, are based on this belief in a subtle but material 'soul' inside the body, and in shape like the body. It would scarcely be going too far to say that all religions, and all philosophies, then existing in the world. were based upon it. Buddhism stands alone among the religions of India in ignoring the soul. The vigour and originality of this new departure are evident from the complete isolation in which Buddhism stands, in this respect, from all other religious systems then existing in the world. And the very great difficulty which those European writers, who are still steeped in animistic <a id="pg243"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span></a> preconceptions, find in appreciating, or even understanding the doctrine, may help us to realise how difficult it must have been for the originator of it to take so decisive and so far-reaching a step in religion and philosophy, at so early a period in the history of human thought.</p>

					<p>Nearly a quarter of a century ago I put this in the forefront of my first exposition of Buddhism. The publication, since then, of numerous texts has shown how the early Buddhist writers had previously followed precisely the same method<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>. They reserve, as is only natural, the enthusiasm of their poetry and eloquence for the positive side of their doctrine, for Arahatship. But the doctrine of the impermanence of each and every condition, physical or mental; the absence of any abiding principle, any entity, any substance, any 'soul' (<i>aniccatā, nissattatā, nijjīvatā, anattalakkhaṇatā, na h'ettha sassato bhāvo attā vā upalabbhati</i>) is treated, from the numerous points of view from which it can be approached, in as many different Suttas.</p>

					<p>For the most part, one point only is dealt with in each text. In our Sutta it is, in the first place, the gradual change of mental conditions, of states of consciousness: and then, secondly, the point that personality, individuality <i>(attapaṭilābho)</i> is only a convenient expression in common use in the world, and therefore made use of also by the Tathāgata, but only in such a manner that he is not led astray by its ambiguity, by its apparent implication of some permanent entity.</p>

					<h1>The Soul Theory</h1>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.09.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.09.than.ati.htm#p1">than</a>]</span> T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> H<span class="f2"><b>AVE</b></span> I H<span class="f2"><b>EARD</b></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthi in Anātha Piṇḍika's pleasaunce in the Jeta Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Poṭṭhapāda,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the wandering mendicant, was dwelling at the hall put up in Queen Mallikā's Park for the discussion of systems of opinion - the hall set round with a row of Tinduka trees, and known by the name of 'The Hall.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And there was with him a great following of mendicants; to wit, three hundred mendicants.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> Now the Exalted One, who had put on his under garment in the early morning, proceeded in his robes, and with his bowl in his hand, into Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is too early now to enter Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me go to the Hall, the debating hall in the Mallikā Park, where Poṭṭhapāda is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he did so.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Now at that time Poṭṭhapāda was seated with the company of the mendicants all talking with loud voices, with shouts and tumult, all sorts of worldly talk: to wit,<br />
					tales of kings, of robbers, of ministers of state;<br />
					tales of war, of terrors, of battles;<br />
					talks about foods and drinks, about clothes and beds and garlands and perfumes;<br />
					talks about relationships;<br />
					talks about equipages, villages, towns, cities, and countries;<br />
					tales about women and heroes;<br />
					gossip such as that at street corners, and places whence water is fetched;<br />
					ghost stories;<br />
					desultory chatter;<br />
					legends about the creation of the land or sea;<br />
					and speculations about existence and non-existence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="pt179" href="../../pali/dn/dn.09.pali.bd.htm#pg179"><span class="f2">[179]</span></a></span> 4. And Poṭṭhapāda, the mendicant, caught sight of the Exalted One approaching in the distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And at the sight of him he called the assembly to order, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Be still, venerable Sirs, and make no noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is the Samaṇa Gotama coming.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that venerable one delights in quiet, and speaks in praise of quietude.</p>

					<p class="f4">How well it were if, seeing how quiet the assembly is, he should see fit to join us!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he spake thus, the mendicants kept silence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now the Exalted One came on to where Poṭṭhapāda, the mendicant was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the latter said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the Exalted One come near.</p>

					<p class="f4">We bid him welcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is long since the Exalted One took the departure<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> of coming our way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him take a seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is a place spread ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One sat down.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Poṭṭhapāda, the mendicant, brought a low stool, and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to him thus seated the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg246"><span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span></a> 'What was the subject, Poṭṭhapāda, that you were seated here together to discuss; and what was the talk among you that has been interrupted?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And when he had thus spoken, Poṭṭhapāda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Never mind, Sir, the subject we were seated together to discuss.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be no difficulty in the Exalted One hearing afterwards about that.</p>

					<p class="f4">But long ago, Sir, on several occasions, when various teachers, Samaṇas and Brahmans, had met together, and were seated in the debating hall, the talk fell on trance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> and the question was:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt180" href="../../pali/dn/dn.09.pali.bd.htm#pg180"><span class="f2">[180]</span></a> "How then, Sirs, is the cessation of consciousness brought about?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now on that some said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ideas come to a man without a reason and without a cause, and so also do they pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time when they spring up within him, then he becomes conscious; when they pass away, then he becomes unconscious."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did they explain the cessation of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">'On that another said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, Sirs, will never be so as you say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, Sirs, is a man's soul.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the soul that comes and goes.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the soul comes into a man then he becomes conscious, when the soul goes away out of a man then he becomes unconscious."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus do others explain the cessation of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">'On that another said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, Sirs, will never be as you say.</p>

					<p class="f4">But there are certain Samaṇas and Brahmans of great power and influence.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is they who infuse consciousness into a man, and draw it away out of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they infuse it into him he becomes conscious, when they draw it away he becomes unconscious."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus do others explain the cessation of consciousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a> 'Then, Sir, the memory of the Exalted One arose in me, and I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Would that the Exalted One, would that the Happy One were here, he who is so skilled in these psychical states."</p>

					<p class="f4">For the Exalted One would know how trance is brought about.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">How, then, Sir, is there cessation of consciousness?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. 'Well, as to that, Poṭṭhapāda, those Samaṇas and Brahmans who said that ideas come to a man and pass away without a reason, and without a cause, are wrong from the very commencement.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is precisely through a reason, by means of a cause, that ideas come and go.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt181" href="../../pali/dn/dn.09.pali.bd.htm#pg181"><span class="f2">[181]</span></a> By training some ideas arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">By training others pass away.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And what is that training?' continued the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, there appears in the world<br />
					one who has won the truth, an Arahat,<br />
					a fully awakened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy,<br />
					who knows all worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher for gods and men,<br />
					a Blessed One, a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees,<br />
					as it were, face-to-face this universe,<br />
					— including the worlds above of the gods,<br />
					the Brahmas, and the Māras,<br />
					and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans,<br />
					its princes and peoples, —<br />
					and having known it,<br />
					he makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth, lovely in its origin,<br />
					lovely in its progress,<br />
					lovely in its consummation,<br />
					doth he proclaim,<br />
					both in the spirit and in the letter,<br />
					the higher life doth he make known,<br />
					in all its fullness and in all its purity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder, or one of his children,<br />
					or a man of inferior birth in any class<br />
					listens to that truth;<br />
					and on hearing it he has faith in the Tathāgata (the one who has found the truth);<br />
					and when he is possessed of that faith,<br />
					he considers thus within himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Full of hindrances is household life,<br />
					a path for the dust of passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free as the air is the life<br />
					of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home<br />
					to live the higher life in all its fullness,<br />
					in all its purity,<br />
					in all its bright perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me then cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and let me go forth<br />
					from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, before long,<br />
					forsaking his portion of wealth,<br />
					be it great or small,<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives,<br />
					be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes,<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life<br />
					into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'When he has thus become a recluse<br />
					he lives self-restrained by that restraint that should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight,<br />
					and he sees danger<br />
					in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindful and self-possessed<br />
					he is altogether happy.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, Poṭṭhapāda, is his conduct good?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this, Poṭṭhapāda, that the Bhikshu,<br />
					putting away the killing of living things,<br />
					holds aloof from the destruction of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The cudgel and the sword he has laid aside,<br />
					and ashamed of roughness,<br />
					and full of mercy,<br />
					he dwells compassionate and kind<br />
					to all creatures that have life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is part of the goodness that he has.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the taking of what has not been given, the Bhikshu lives aloof from grasping what is not his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will come, he passes his life in honesty and purity of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is part of the goodness that he has.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away unchastity, the Bhikshu is chaste.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away slander, the Bhikshu holds himself aloof from calumny.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he hears here he repeats not elsewhere to raise a quarrel against the people here; what he hears elsewhere he repeats not here to raise a quarrel against the people there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he live as a binder together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is part of the goodness that he has.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away rudeness of speech, the Bhikshu holds himself aloof from harsh language.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever word is blameless, pleasant to the car, lovely, reaching to the heart, pleasing to the people, beloved of the people-such are words he speaks.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is part of the goodness that he has.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away frivolous talk, the Bhikshu holds himself aloof from vain conversation.</p>

					<p class="f4">In season he speaks, in accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on religion, on the discipline of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks, and at the right time, words worthy to be laid up in one's heart, fitly illustrated, clearly divided, to the point.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikshu holds himself aloof from causing injury to seeds or plants.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day, not eating at night, refraining from food after hours (after midday).</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from being a spectator at shows at fairs, with nautch dances, singing, and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from wearing, adorning, or ornamenting himself with garlands, scents, and unguents.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from the use of large and lofty beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were to set up that which has been thrown down, or were to reveal that which has been hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external forms, - just even so has the truth <a id="pg264"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span></a> been made known, in many a figure, by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Abhisaññā-nirodho,</i> 'the cessation of consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains that they came to this conclusion on the ground of such instances as that of the Rishi Migasingī, who, through love of the celestial nymph Alambusā, fell into a trance that lasted for three years. This must be a different tale from that of the Rishi Isisinga of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/jat/idx_jataka.htm#jat_523">Jātaka No. 523,</a> whom Alambusā tries in vain to seduce. Compare Vimāna Vatthu XVIII, 11; L, 2 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains that the ground for this view is the way in which sorcerers work charms (<i>Athabbanikā athabbanaɱ payogenti</i> — perhaps 'Atharva priests work out an Atharva charm') which make a man appear as dead as if his head had been cut off; and then bring him back to his natural condition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Saññā-nirodhassa pakataññū.</i> So Buddhaghosa. Compare Vin. II, 199.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Saññā</i> which is used in a sense covering both 'idea' and 'consciousness.' <i>Ekā'saññā</i> is therefore rendered below, in the refrain, one idea, one sort of consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> <i>Sukha</i> and <i>dukkha.</i> Well-fare and ill-fare, well-being and ill-being, ease and dis-ease, uneasiness, discomfort. 'Pain' is both too strong a word, and has too frequently an exclusively physical sense, to be a good rendering of dukkha. It is unfortunate that dis-ease has acquired a special connotation which prevents the word being used here; and that we have no pair of correlative words corresponding to those in the Pāli. For pain we have <i>vedanā</i> often (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.002.pali.bd.htm#pg10">M. I, 10;</a> M.P.S., chapters 2 and 4; Mil. 134), and sometimes <i>dukkha-vedanā</i> (Mil. 112).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Viññāṇa;</i> the exact translation of this word is still uncertain. Perhaps 'mind,' is meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> On these last three sections, which set out the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of Deliverance (the <i>Vimokkhas</i>), see my former translation at p. 52 of my 'Buddhist Suttas' (S.B.E.) and the notes on pp. 50, 51. These stages are almost exactly the same as the views controverted above at pp. 47, 48. And the doctrine of the sixth <i>Vimokkha,</i> as we see from M. I, 164, formed part of the teaching of Gotama's teacher, Ālāra Kālāma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Abhisaɱkhareyyaɱ,</i> perhaps 'perfecting' or 'planning out.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The foregoing discussion on trance is the earliest one on that subject in Indian literature. Trance is not mentioned in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Ñāṇa</i> depends on <i>saññā;</i> that is, I take it, that the mass of knowledge a man has, his insight, his power of judgement, depends on the ideas, the states of consciousness (here, in this connection, those that arise in the <i>Jhānas,</i> etc.) that are 'themselves due to the action on his sense organs of the outside world; but are in so far under his own control that he can shut out some, and give play to others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that as a village pig, even if you bathe it in scented water, and anoint it with perfumes, and deck it with garlands, and lay it to rest on the best bed, will not feel happy there, but will go straight back to the dung-heap to take its ease; so Poṭṭhapāda, having tasted the sweet taste of the doctrine of the Three Signs (of the impermanence, the pain, and the absence of any abiding principle) found in everything, harks back to the superstition of the 'soul.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Paccemi.</i> This is another of the words the exact sense of which, in <i>Piṭaka</i> times, is still doubtful. It means primarily 'to go back towards, to revert,' and is so used in the <i>Piṭakas.</i> So in G. V, 196 and in SN. 662 (quoted as verse 125 in the Dhammapada, and recurring also G. III, 203; S. I, 13, 164). But somewhat in the same way as to go back home is to go to a place of security; so in a secondary sense, of opinions or reasons, it means apparently to revert to them, fall back on them, harp on them, with the connotation of regarding them as certain. At S.N. 803 it can be taken either way. At S.N. 788, 803, 840 = 908 ; M. I, 309, 445, and in the question and answer here, the latter seems to be the sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says this was not his real opinion. He held to that set. out below in § 23. But he advances this, more elementary, proposition, just to see how the Buddha would meet it. It is nearly the same as the first of the seven propositions about the soul controverted in the <a href="dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm">Brahma-jāla</a> (above, PP. 46-48).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> This sort of soul is nearly the same as the one referred to above, the <a href="dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm">Brahma-jāla</a> (§ 12, p. 47); and in the <a href="dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm">Sāmañña-phala</a> (§ 85, p.87). It is a soul the exact copy, in every respect, of the body, and material, but so subtle that it can be described as 'made of mind.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> The text repeats the answer given in § 21, with the necessary alterations. The supposition in § 23 is quoted at Asl. 360. The argument is of course that, even if Poṭṭhapāda had any one of these three sorts of soul, then he would regard each of them, in the given case, as a permanent entity. But the consciousness is not an entity. It is a 'becoming' only; subject, as he must (and would) admit, to constant chance. On his own showing then, it is not 'soul.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> On these Ten Indeterminates see above, in the Introduction to the Mahāli Sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> <i>Dukkha.</i> See the note above on § 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> These are the Four Truths, set out more fully in my 'Buddhist Suttas' (S.B.E.), pp. 148-150.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> <i>Vācāya sannitodakena sañjambhariɱ akaɱsu.</i> So also at S. II, 282 and A. I, 187. Probably from the roots <i>tud</i> and <i>jambh.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> There are seven or eight Cittas in the books, one of whom, a layman, was placed by the Buddha at the head of the expounders of the Norm. The Citta of our passage was famous for the fact that he joined the Buddha's Order, and then, on one pretext or another, left it again, no less than seven times. (The same thing is related by I-Tsing of Bhartṛihari) He prided himself on his keenness in distinguishing subtle differences in the meanings of words. And his last revolt was owing to a discussion of that sort he had had with Mahā Koṭṭhita. He took refuge with his friend Poṭṭhapāda, who, says Buddhaghosa, brought him along with him, on this occasion, with the express purpose of bringing. about a reconciliation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Compare above, pp. 44-47.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa takes <i>janaɱ passaɱ</i> as plurals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> <i>Appāṭihīrakataɱ.</i> Buddhaghosa explains this as 'witless' <i>(paṭibhāna-virahitaɱ).</i> It is the contrary of <i>sappāṭihīrakataɱ</i> which he explains (on § 45 below) by <i>sappaṭiviharaṇaɱ.</i> Perhaps the meaning of the two words is 'apposite' and 'not apposite' (compare B.R. on <i>pratiharaṇa</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is a closely-allied expression at M.P. 8., pp. 26, 32, where the talk is of disciples who, when a discussion on a wrong opinion has arisen, know how to refute it according to the doctrine <i>(Dharma),</i> and to preach, on the other hand, a doctrine that is <i>sappāṭihāriyaɱ;</i> that is, a doctrine which, in contradistinction to the heresy advanced, is the apposite explanation from the Buddhist point of view. The <i>Pāli</i> word for miracle comes from the same root <i>(prati-har);</i> but to render here 'unmiraculous' would make nonsense of the passage, and both my own and Windisch's rendering of the word in the M.P.S. ('Buddhist Suttas,' p. 43. Māra und Buddha,' p.71) must be also modified accordingly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On the form compare <i>anuhīramāne,</i> quoted at Sum. I, 61 from the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14">Mahā-padhāna Suttanta</a> (No. 14 in the Dīgha).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> This simile recurs. in the 'Tevijja Sutta (translated in my, Buddhist Suttas,' S.B.E., XI, 175) and in the Majjhima II, 33.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> <i>Mangura-c-chavī.</i> Perhaps 'of sallow complexion.' Compare M. I, 246 where all these three words for complexion are used. <i>Mangulī itthī</i> at V. III, 107 = S. II, 260 is an allied form. In all these cases an unhealthy complexion is inferred. Here it must evidently be taken in a favourable sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> [picked up from § 34]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> [picked up from § 34]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> <i>Oḷāriko, manomayo,</i> and <i>arūpo atta-paṭilābho.</i> Buddhaghosa here explains <i>atta-paṭilābho</i> by <i>attabhāva-paṭilābho;</i> and on <i>attabhāva</i> he says ( Asl. 308) that it is used for the body, or the five <i>Skandhas,</i> because the fool jumps to the conclusion: 'This is my soul.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">These three forms of personality correspond nearly to the planes, or divisions, into which the worlds are divided in the later Buddhist theory — (1) the eleven <i>kāmā-vacara</i> worlds, from purgatory below to the <i>deva</i> heavens above, both inclusive: (2) the <i>rūpā-vacara</i> worlds, which are the sixteen worlds of the Brahma gods, and are attained to by the practice of the Four Raptures (the Four <i>Jhāna's</i>): (3) the four <i>arūpā-vacara</i> worlds, attained to by the practice of four of the <i>Vimokkhas</i> (Nos. 4-7).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It will be noticed that the lowest of these three planes includes all the forms of existence known in the West, from hell beneath to heaven above. And that the others are connected with the pre-Buddhistic idea of ecstatic meditation leading to special forms of re-existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">But it is clear from § 58 below that the opinion here put forward is intended to represent, not any Buddhist theory, but a view commonly entertained in the world, such as Poṭṭhapāda himself would admit, and indeed has admitted (above, §§ 21-23). In either case, of course, these modes of existence would be, from the Buddhist point of view, purely temporary. They are the fleeting union of qualities that make up, for a time only, an unstable individuality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> The whole paragraph is repeated for each of the three modes of personality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> These <i>saŋkilesikā dhammā</i> are identified by Buddhaghosa, with the twelve <i>kāmā-vacara-akusala-citta-pādā</i> of <i>Dhamma Saɱgaṇi</i> 365-430. But compare, <i>contra,</i> Dh. S. 1241 (where, of course, the word <i>apariyāpannā</i> must be struck out).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains these as 'tranquillity and insight.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> In the words of §§ 39, 40; that is, that whatever the mode of existence, of temporary individuality, there is happiness obtainable, but only in one way, by getting rid, namely, of certain evil dispositions, and by the increase of certain good dispositions. Buddhaghosa thinks this is said in protest against those who, seeking for happiness beyond the grave, do not admit that happiness can he reached here (as above in f 34).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The above rendering of the elliptical phrase <i>Ayaɱ vā so</i> is confirmed by the simile in § 46.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> See above, § 37.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> [Picked up from §§ 42-45]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> Each of the three cases is given in full. [Ed. expanded here.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> The point is, of course, that just as there is no substratum in the products of the cow, so in man there is no ego, no constant unity, no 'soul' (in the animistic sense of the word, as used by savages). There are a number of qualities that, when united, make up a personality — always changing. When the change has reached a certain point, it is convenient to change the designation, the name, by which the personality is known — just as in the case of the products of the cow. But the abstract term is only a convenient form of expression. There never was any personality, as a separate entity, all the time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The author of the Milinda (pp. 25, 27) has a precisely similar argument.</p>
