					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Tevijja Sutta</b></h4>.

					<p>This is the only Suttanta, among the thirteen translated in this volume, in which the discourse does not lead up to Arahatship. It leads up only to the so-called Brahma Vihāras — the supreme conditions — four states of mind held to result, after death, in a rebirth in the heavenly worlds of Brahmā. Why is it — the Buddhist ideal being Arahatship, which leads to no rebirth at all — that this lower ideal is thus suddenly introduced?</p>

					<p>It would seem that the particular point here discussed was regarded as so important that it could scarcely be left out. And when we recollect that the highest teaching current before the Buddha, and still preserved in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads, was precisely about union with Brahmā; we may, without much danger of error, explain the position occupied in the series of dialogues by this Suttanta by the supposition that it was deliberately inserted here as the Buddhist answer to the Upanishad theory. In this respect it is noteworthy that the neuter Brahman is quietly ignored. That is quite in accordance with the method of the Suttantas. The Buddha is in them often represented as using, in his own sense, words familiar to his interlocutors in a different sense. The neuter Brahman is, so far as I am aware, entirely unknown in the Nikāyas, and of course the Buddha's idea of Brahmā, in the masculine, really differs widely from that of the Upanishads.</p>

					<p>There is nothing original in the Buddhist belief that a man's habit of mind at the time of his death would determine, save only in the one case of the Arahat, the nature of his rebirth. It is an Indian — not an exclusively Buddhist theory. The Buddhist texts represent it as held by non-Buddhists, and already long before. the Buddha's time, and as accepted by all as a matter of course. And it is even not exclusively Indian. As I have pointed out elsewhere, it is <a id="pg299"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span></a> ascribed by Plato to Socrates<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>. The essentially Buddhist parts of the theory are three. In the first place, the choice of the particular details they held essential to such a habit of mind as would lead to rebirth in the Brahmā-worlds; secondly, their doctrine that there was not really any 'soul' to be reborn; and thirdly, that the highest ideal was not to be reborn at all (even only once, and into union with Brahmā).</p>

					<p>The Jātaka commentary in numerous passages states that the four Brahma vihāras were practised, long before the time of the rise of Buddhism, by the sages of old. I have not found such a statement in the Nikāyas; and it is most probable therefore that the Jātaka commentator is ante-dating the particular meditations in question. However this may be, they remained, throughout the long history of Buddhism, an essential part of Buddhist practice. They are even mentioned in the Jātaka Mālā, a work usually supposed to be Mahāyānist, and dated about a thousand years later than the Buddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>. They are well known to-day in Burma, Siam, and Ceylon. And it would be interesting to know whether they still form a part of the regulated meditations which are known to be practised by Buddhists in Thibet, China, and Japan. But they have not been found in any Indian book not a Buddhist work, and are therefore almost certainly exclusively Buddhist. Even the most determined anti-Buddhist must admit the beauty of the language (in spite of its repetitions §§ 76-78), the subtle depth of the ideas, and the great value of the practice from the point of view of ethical self-training. He would probably rejoin, and with truth, that similar sentiments are met with in other (post-Buddhistic) Indian books. But it is one thing to give expression in isolated passages to such views, and quite another to have selected just these four as the four cornerstones of habitual endeavour.</p>

					<p>It should be recollected that the argument here is only an argumetium ad hominem. If you want union with Brahmā — which you had much better not want — this is the way to attain to it<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Exalted One was once journeying through Kosala with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Brahman village in Kosala which is called Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there at Manasākaṭa the Exalted One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the river Akiravatī, to the north of Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans were staying at Manasākaṭa; to wit, Kaŋkī the Brahman, Tārukkha the Brahman, Pokkharasādi the Brahman, Jāṇussoṇi the Brahman, Todeyya the Brahman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> 3.

					<p class="f4">4. The young Brahman Vāseṭṭha spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Pokkharasādi."</p>

					<p class="f4">5. The young Brahman Bhāradvāja spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman Tārukkha."</p>

					<p class="f4">6. But neither was the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha able to convince the young Brahman Bhāradvāja, nor was the young Brahman Bhāradvāja able to convince the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Then the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha said to the young Brahman Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That Samaṇa Gotama, Bhāradvāja, of the sons of the Sākyas, who went out from the Sākya clan to adopt the religious life, is now staying at Manasākaṭa, in the mango grove, on the bank of the river Aciravatī, to the north of Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'That Exalted One is an Arahat, a fully enlightened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> Come, then, Bhāradvāja, let us go to the place where the Samaṇa Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the Samaṇa Gotama touching this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the Samaṇa Gotama shall declare unto us, that let us bear in mind."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, my friend!' said the young Brahman Bhāradvāja, in assent, to the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha and the young Brahman Bhāradvāja went on to the place where the Exalted One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Exalted One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while they were thus seated the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path, and which the false.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between us."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. "So you say, Vāseṭṭha, that you said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "Concerning the true path and the false, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are all these saving paths?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with Brahmā?"</p>

					<p class="f4">11. "Do you say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say so, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> "Do you really say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So I say, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">12. "But yet, Vāseṭṭha, is there a single one of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas, who has ever seen Brahmā, face-to-face"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, indeed, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Or is there then, Vāseṭṭha, a single one of the teachers of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face-to-face"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, indeed, Gotama!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Or is there then, Vāseṭṭha, a single one of the Brahmans up to the seventh generation who has seen Brahmā face-to-face?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, indeed, Gotama!"</p>

					<p class="f4">13. "Well then, Vāseṭṭha, those ancient Rishis of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the Brahmans of to-day chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aŋgirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> — did even they speak thus, saying: 'We know it, we have seen it, where Brahmā is whence Brahmā is, whither Brahmā is'?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Not so, Gotama!"</p>

					<p class="f4">14. "Then you say, Vāseṭṭha that none of the Brahmans, or of their teachers, or of their pupils, even up to the seventh generation, has ever seen Brahmā face-to-face.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what think you, Vāseṭṭha, suppose there were a man born in Manasākaṭa, and people should ask him, who never till that time had left Manasākaṭa, which was the way to Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man, born and brought up in Manasākaṭa, be in any doubt or difficulty?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly not, Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">For Brahmā, I know, Vāseṭṭha, and the world of Brahmā, and the path which leadeth unto it.</p>

					<p class="f4">40. Then the Blessed One spake, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Know, Vāseṭṭha, that (from time to time) a Tathāgata is born into the world, an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding, in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, by himself, thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were, face-to-face this universe — including the worlds above with the gods, the Māras, and the Brahmās; and the world below with its Samaṇas and Brahmans, its princes and peoples; — and he then makes his knowledge known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">The truth doth he proclaim both in the letter and in the spirit, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its perfectness.</p>

					<p class="f4">41. A householder (gahapati), or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing the truth he has faith in the Tathāgata, and when he has acquired that faith he thus considers with himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passion:<br />
					free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">How difficult it is for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from a household life into the homeless state.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then before long, forsaking his portion of wealth, be it great or be it small;<br />
					forsaking his circle of relatives, be they many or be they few,<br />
					he cuts off his hair and beard,<br />
					he clothes himself in the orange— <a id="pg317"><span class="f2 g"><b>[317]</b></span></a> coloured robes<br />
					and he goes forth from the household life into the homeless state.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p42">42.</a> When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life self-restrained by that restraint which should be binding on a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid.</p>

					<p class="f4">He adopts and trains himself in the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He encompasses himself with goodness in word and deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sustains his life by means that are quite pure; good is his conduct, guarded the door of his senses; mindful and self-possessed, he is altogether happy!</p>

					<p class="f4">43-75. And how, Vāseṭṭha, is his conduct good?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> This Suttanta was translated from the MSS. in my 'Buddhist Suttas ' (S.B.E., 1881). Since then the text has been published by the Pāli Text Society; and alterations and amendments in a number of details have been rendered necessary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that Kaŋkī lived at Opasāda, Tārukkha lived at Icchagala (so MSS., perhaps for Icchānangala), Pokkharasādi (sic MS.)lived at Ukkaṭṭha, Jāṇussoṇi lived at Sāvatthi, and Todeyya lived at Tudigama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Jāṇussoṇi was converted by the Bhaya-bherava Sutta. On Pokkharasādi, see above, pp. 108, 135, 147; and on Todeyya, see above, p. 267; and on all the names, see Majjhima Nikāya, No. 98= Sutta Nipāta, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Buddhaghosa adds that because Manasākaṭa was a pleasant place the Brahmans had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their mantras.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup>Jaŋghāvihāraɱ anucaŋkamantānaɱ anuvicarantānaɱ. Caŋkamati is to walk up and down thinking. I have added 'after their bath,' from Buddhaghosa, who says that this must be understood to have taken place when, after learning by heart and repeating all day, they, went down in the evening to the riverside to bathe, and then walked up and down on the sand. COMP. Mil. 22; Jāt. II, 240,272.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Comp. Divyāvadāna 196, 246; and Aŋguttara II, pp. 23, 24.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This is either mildly sarcastic-as much as to say, 'that is six of one, and half a dozen of the other'-- or is intended to lead on Vāseṭṭha to confess still more directly the fact that the different theologians held inconsistent opinions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The Mss. differ as to the last name, and some of them omit the last but one. The Adhvaryu, Taittirīya, Chandoga, and Bahvrica priests-those skilled in liturgy generally, and in the Yajur, Sāma, and Rig Vedas respectively — are probably meant. If we adopt the other reading for the last in the list, then those priests who relied on liturgy, sacrifice, or chant would be contrasted with those who had 'gone forth' as religieux, either as Tāpasas or as Bhikshus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> See the note on these names at 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 130.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> In the text §§ 12, 13 are repeated word for word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>] </sup>Andhaveṇī paramparaɱ saŋsattā. The Phayre Ms. has replaced veṇī by paveṇī, after the constant custom of the Burmese Mss. to improve away unusual or difficult expressions. Buddhaghosa explains andhaveṇi by andhapaveṇi; and tells a tale of a wicked wight, who meeting a company of blind men, told them of a certain village wherein plenty of good food was to be had. When they besought him for hire to lead them there, he took the money, made one blind man catch hold of his stick, the next of that one, and so on, and then led them on till they came to a wilderness. There he deserted them, and they all — still holding each the other, and vainly, and with tears, seeking both their guide and the path — came to a miserable end! Comp. M. II, 170.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The words of the question are repeated in the text in this and the following answers. It must be remembered, for these sections, that the Sun and Moon were gods just as much as Brahmā; and that the Moon always comes first in Nikāya and other ancient texts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> The text repeats at length the words of §§ 12, 13, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Samatittika kākapeyyā. See on this phrase the note in my Buddhist Suttas (S. B. E.), pp. 178, 179.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The Sinhalese Mss. omit Mahiddhi and Yama, but repeat the verb, 'we call upon,' three times after Brahmā. It is possible that the Burmese copyist has wrongly inserted them to remove the strangeness of this repetition. The comment is silent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The Buddha, as usual, here takes the 'further bank' in the meaning attached to it by the theologians he is talking to, as union with Brahmā. In his own system, of course, the 'further bank' is Arahatship. So Aŋguttara V, 232, 233, and elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Gathitā mucchitā ajjhopannā. See A. I, 74, 274; Udāna VII, 3, 4; Sum. 59, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Ariyassa vinaye. This may possibly mean 'in the disciple recommended by the Arahat' (that is, by the Buddha). But the latter is expressed rather by Sugata-vinaye. Comp. Aŋguttara V, 237-239 with 234, 235.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> These Five 'Hindrances are more fully dealt with above, p. 82.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Sapariggaho vā Brahmā apariggaho va ti. Buddhaghosa says on Vāseṭṭha's reply, 'Kāmacchandassa ,ābhavato itthipariggahena apariggaho,' thus restricting the 'possession' to women. But the reference is no doubt to the first 'hindrance'; and the word in the text, though doubtless alluding to possession of women also. includes more. Compare, on the general idea of the passage, the English expression, 'no encumbrances,' and Jacobi, 'Jaina-Sūtras' (S.B.E.) I, xxiii.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Asaŋkiliṭṭha-citto. That is, says Buddhaghosa, free from mental torpor and idleness, worry and flurry.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Vasavattī vā avasavattī vā. Buddhaghosa says, in explanation of the, answer, 'By the absence of wavering he has his mind under control (vase vatteti).'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> āsīditva saŋsīdanti. I have no doubt the commentator is right in his explanation of these figurative expressions. Confident in their knowledge of the Vedas, and in their practice of Vedic ceremonies, they neglect higher things; and so, sinking into folly and superstition, 'they are arriving only at despair, thinking the while that they are crossing over into some happier land.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa takes this to mean, 'Save me of the Brahman race.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> 'The point is, that the acceptance of this 'Doctrine and Discipline' is open to all; not of course that Brahmans never accept it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> These paragraphs occur frequently; see. inter alia, Mahā-Sudassana Sutta II, 8, in my 'Buddhist Suttas' (S. B. E.). It will be seen from 'Buddhism,' pp. 170, 171, that these meditations play a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. These four (or-five), are called the Brahma Vihāras, and the practice of them leads, not to Arahatship, but to rebirth in the Brahmā-world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Paragraphs 76, 77 are supposed to be repeated of each.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Paragraphs 76, 77 are supposed to be repeated of each.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Paragraphs 76, 77 are supposed to be repeated of each.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Literally 'The Suttanta about those who have the knowledge of the Three (Vedas).' Sec p.303, where the names of these, 'doctors' are given.</p>
