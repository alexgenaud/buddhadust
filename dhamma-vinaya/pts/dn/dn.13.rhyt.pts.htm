					<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
					to the<br />
					Tevijja Sutta</b></h4>.

					<p>This is the only Suttanta, among the thirteen translated in this volume, in which the discourse does not lead up to Arahatship. It leads up only to the so-called Brahma Vihāras — the supreme conditions — four states of mind held to result, after death, in a rebirth in the heavenly worlds of Brahmā. Why is it — the Buddhist ideal being Arahatship, which leads to no rebirth at all — that this lower ideal is thus suddenly introduced?</p>

					<p>It would seem that the particular point here discussed was regarded as so important that it could scarcely be left out. And when we recollect that the highest teaching current before the Buddha, and still preserved in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads, was precisely about union with Brahmā; we may, without much danger of error, explain the position occupied in the series of dialogues by this Suttanta by the supposition that it was deliberately inserted here as the Buddhist answer to the Upanishad theory. In this respect it is noteworthy that the neuter Brahman is quietly ignored. That is quite in accordance with the method of the Suttantas. The Buddha is in them often represented as using, in his own sense, words familiar to his interlocutors in a different sense. The neuter Brahman is, so far as I am aware, entirely unknown in the Nikāyas, and of course the Buddha's idea of Brahmā, in the masculine, really differs widely from that of the Upanishads.</p>

					<p>There is nothing original in the Buddhist belief that a man's habit of mind at the time of his death would determine, save only in the one case of the Arahat, the nature of his rebirth. It is an Indian — not an exclusively Buddhist theory. The Buddhist texts represent it as held by non-Buddhists, and already long before. the Buddha's time, and as accepted by all as a matter of course. And it is even not exclusively Indian. As I have pointed out elsewhere, it is <a id="pg299"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span></a> ascribed by Plato to Socrates.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> The essentially Buddhist parts of the theory are three. In the first place, the choice of the particular details they held essential to such a habit of mind as would lead to rebirth in the Brahmā-worlds; secondly, their doctrine that there was not really any 'soul' to be reborn; and thirdly, that the highest ideal was not to be reborn at all (even only once, and into union with Brahmā).</p>

					<p>The Jātaka commentary in numerous passages states that the four Brahma vihāras were practised, long before the time of the rise of Buddhism, by the sages of old. I have not found such a statement in the Nikāyas; and it is most probable therefore that the Jātaka commentator is ante-dating the particular meditations in question. However this may be, they remained, throughout the long history of Buddhism, an essential part of Buddhist practice. They are even mentioned in the <a href="../../../resources/pdf/jataka_mala/garland-of-birth-stories.pdf">Jātaka Mālā,</a> a work usually supposed to be Mahāyānist, and dated about a thousand years later than the Buddha.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> They are well known to-day in Burma, Siam, and Ceylon. And it would be interesting to know whether they still form a part of the regulated meditations which are known to be practised by Buddhists in Thibet, China, and Japan. But they have not been found in any Indian book not a Buddhist work, and are therefore almost certainly exclusively Buddhist. Even the most determined anti-Buddhist must admit the beauty of the language (in spite of its repetitions §§ 76-78), the subtle depth of the ideas, and the great value of the practice from the point of view of ethical self-training. He would probably rejoin, and with truth, that similar sentiments are met with in other (post-Buddhistic) Indian books. But it is one thing to give expression in isolated passages to such views, and quite another to have selected just these four as the four cornerstones of habitual endeavour.</p>

					<p>It should be recollected that the argument here is only an <i>argumetium ad hominem.</i> If you want union with Brahmā — which you had much better not want — this is the way to attain to it.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When the Exalted One was once journeying through Kosala<br />
					with a great company of the brethren,<br />
					with about five hundred brethren,<br />
					he came to the Brahman village in Kosala<br />
					which is called Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there at Manasākaṭa<br />
					the Exalted One stayed in the mango grove,<br />
					on the bank of the river Akiravatī,<br />
					to the north of Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time<br />
					many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans<br />
					were staying at Manasākaṭa;<br />
					to wit, Kaṅkī the Brahman,<br />
					Tārukkha the Brahman,<br />
					Pokkharasādi the Brahman,<br />
					Jāṇussoṇi the Brahman,<br />
					Todeyya the Brahman,<br />
					and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> 3. Now a conversation sprung up between Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja,<br />
					when they were taking exercise<br />
					(after their bath)<br />
					and walking up and down,<br />
					in thoughtful mood,<br />
					as to which was the true path,<br />
					and which the false<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. The young Brahman Vāseṭṭha spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been announced<br />
					by the Brahman Pokkharasādi."</p>

					<p class="f4">5. The young Brahman Bhāradvāja spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />
					which makes for salvation,<br />
					and leads him who acts according to it,<br />
					into a state of union with Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been announced<br />
					by the Brahman Tārukkha."</p>

					<p class="f4">6. But neither was the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha<br />
					able to convince the young Brahman Bhāradvāja,<br />
					nor was the young Brahman Bhāradvāja<br />
					able to convince the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Then the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha<br />
					said to the young Brahman Bhāradvāja:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That Samaṇa Gotama, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					of the sons of the Sākyas,<br />
					who went out from the Sākya clan<br />
					to adopt the religious life,<br />
					is now staying at Manasākaṭa,<br />
					in the mango grove,<br />
					on the bank of the river Aciravatī,<br />
					to the north of Manasākaṭa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now regarding that venerable Gotama,<br />
					such is the high reputation<br />
					that has been noised abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That Exalted One is an Arahat,<br />
					a fully enlightened one,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and goodness,<br />
					happy,<br />
					with knowledge of the worlds,<br />
					unsurpassed as a guide<br />
					to mortals willing to be led,<br />
					a teacher of gods and men,<br />
					an Exalted One,<br />
					a Buddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> Come, then, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					let us go to the place<br />
					where the Samaṇa Gotama is;<br />
					and when we have come there,<br />
					let us ask the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
					touching this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the Samaṇa Gotama shall declare unto us,<br />
					that let us bear in mind."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, my friend!"<br />

					to the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha<br />
					and the young Brahman Bhāradvāja<br />
					went on to the place<br />
					where the Exalted One was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when they had come there,<br />
					they exchanged with the Exalted One<br />
					the greetings and compliments<br />
					of politeness and courtesy,<br />
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while they were thus seated<br />
					the young Brahman Vāseṭṭha<br />
					said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As we, Gotama, were taking exercise<br />
					and walking up and down,<br />
					there sprung up a conversation between us<br />
					on which was the true path,<br />
					and which the false.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />

					which makes for salvation,<br />

					<p class="f4">Bhāradvāja said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that which has been announced<br />
					by the Brahman Tārukkha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Regarding this matter, Gotama,<br />
					there is a strife,<br />
					a dispute,<br />
					a difference of opinion between us."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. "So you say, Vāseṭṭha,<br />
					that you said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the straight path,<br />
					this the direct way<br />

					<p class="f4">While Bhāradvāja said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "Concerning the true path<br />

					<p class="f4">11. "Do you say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I say so, Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> "Do you really say that they all lead aright, Vāseṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">12. "But yet, Vāseṭṭha,<br />

					pleasing to the people,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that Kaṅkī lived at Opasāda, Tārukkha lived at Icchagala (so MSS., perhaps for Icchānangala), Pokkharasādi (sic MS.) lived at Ukkaṭṭha, Jāṇussoṇi lived at Sāvatthi, and Todeyya lived at Tudigama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/janussoni.htm">Jāṇussoṇi</a> was converted by the Bhaya-bherava Sutta.

					<p class="lgqt">Buddhaghosa adds that because Manasākaṭa was a pleasant place the Brahmans had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their mantras.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup><i>Jaṅghāvihāraɱ anucaṅkamantānaɱ anuvicarantānaɱ. Caṅkamati</i> is to walk up and down thinking. I have added 'after their bath,' from Buddhaghosa, who says that this must be understood to have taken place when, after learning by heart and repeating all day, they, went down in the evening to the riverside to bathe, and then walked up and down on the sand.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This is either mildly sarcastic - as much as to say, 'that is six of one, and half a dozen of the other' - or is intended to lead on Vāseṭṭha to confess still more directly the fact that the different theologians held inconsistent opinions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The Mss. differ as to the last name, and some of them omit the last but one. The Adhvaryu, Taittirīya, Chandoga, and Bahvrica priests-those skilled in liturgy generally, and in the Yajur, Sāma, and Rig Vedas respectively — are probably meant. If we adopt the other reading for the last in the list, then those priests who relied on liturgy, sacrifice, or chant would be contrasted with those who had 'gone forth' as religieux, either as Tāpasas or as Bhikshus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Maggāni, which is noteworthy as a curious change of gender.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> In the text §§ 12, 13 are repeated word for word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>] </sup><i>Andhaveṇī paramparaɱ saṅsattā.</i> The Phayre Ms. has replaced <i>veṇī</i> by <i>paveṇī,</i> after the constant custom of the Burmese Mss. to improve away unusual or difficult expressions. Buddhaghosa explains <i>andhaveṇi</i> by <i>andhapaveṇi;</i> and tells a tale of a wicked wight, who meeting a company of blind men, told them of a certain village wherein plenty of good food was to be had. When they besought him for hire to lead them there, he took the money, made one blind man catch hold of his stick, the next of that one, and so on, and then led them on till they came to a wilderness. There he deserted them, and they all — still holding each the other, and vainly, and with tears, seeking both their guide and the path — came to a miserable end!

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The words of the question are repeated in the text in this and the following answers. It must be remembered, for these sections, that the Sun and Moon were gods just as much as Brahmā; and that the Moon always comes first in Nikāya and other ancient texts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> The text repeats at length the words of §§ 12, 13, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The Sinhalese Mss. omit Mahiddhi and Yama, but repeat the verb, 'we call upon,' three times after Brahmā. It is possible that the Burmese copyist has wrongly inserted them to remove the strangeness of this repetition. The comment is silent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The Buddha, as usual, here takes the 'further bank' in the meaning attached to it by the theologians he is talking to, as union with Brahmā. In his own system, of course, the 'further bank' is Arahatship. So <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p118"><i>Aṅguttara</i> V, 232, 233,</a> and elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>'Sapariggaho vā Brahmā apariggaho va' ti.</i> Buddhaghosa says on Vāseṭṭha's reply, <i>'Kāmacchandassa, ābhavato itthipariggahena apariggaho,'</i> thus restricting the 'possession' to women. But the reference is no doubt to the first 'hindrance'; and the word in the text, though doubtless alluding to possession of women also. includes more. Compare, on the general idea of the passage, the English expression, 'no encumbrances,' and Jacobi, 'Jaina-Sūtras' <i>(S.B.E.)</i> I, xxiii.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Asaṅkiliṭṭha-citto.</i> That is, says Buddhaghosa, free from mental torpor and idleness, worry and flurry.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> <i>Vasavattī vā avasavattī vā.</i> Buddhaghosa says, in explanation of the, answer, 'By the absence of wavering he has his mind under control <i>(vase vatteti).'</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>āsīditva saṅsīdanti.</i> I have no doubt the commentator is right in his explanation of these figurative expressions. Confident in their knowledge of the Vedas, and in their practice of Vedic ceremonies, they neglect higher things; and so, sinking into folly and superstition, 'they are arriving only at despair, thinking the while that they are crossing over into some happier land.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa takes this to mean, 'Save me of the Brahman race.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> 'The point is, that the acceptance of this 'Doctrine and Discipline' is open to all; not of course that Brahmans never accept it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> These paragraphs occur frequently; see. <i>inter alia,</i> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/dn.17.rhyt.bs_6.2.htm">Mahā-Sudassana Sutta II,</a> 8, in my <i>'Buddhist Suttas</i>' <i>(S.B.E.).</i> It will be seen from 'Buddhism,' pp. 170, 171, that these meditations play a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. These four (or-five), are called the Brahma Vihāras, and the practice of them leads, not to Arahatship, but to rebirth in the Brahmā-world.</p>
