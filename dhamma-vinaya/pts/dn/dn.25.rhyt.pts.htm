<meta name="description" content="The T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys Davids translation of Dīgha Nikāya, Sutta 25, Udumbarika-Sihanada Suttanta. Gotama instructs a group of ascetics on the way to bring the ascetic practice to it's highest perfection. This is a rare case where the Buddha, even after making an heroic effort fails utterly. This is also a sutta which shows the absolutely vital role repetition plays in the suttas. This was a spell which was designed to bring a group of committed ascetics step-by-step to the topmost peak of their discipline with the intent of bringing them, from that point, over to Gotama's system. It worked as far as bringing the group to their highest development, but failed to bring them across." />

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One was once staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm">Rājagaha,</a> on the Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					there was sojourning in Queen Udumbarikā's Park<br />
					assigned to the Wanderers,<br />
					the Wanderer Nigrodha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					together with a great company of Wanderers,<br />
					even three thousand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the householder Sandhāna<br />
					went forth in the afternoon<br />
					from Rājagaha,<br />
					to call on the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not timely to call just now on the Exalted One;<br />
					he will be in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it the hour for calling on the brethren<br />
					who are practising mind-culture;<br />
					they will be in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to go to Udumbarikā's Park<br />
					and find out Nigrodha, the Wanderer?</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sandhāna did so.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time Nigrodha the Wanderer<br />
					was seated with his large company,<br />
					all talking with loud voices,<br />
					with noise and clamour,<br />
					carrying on childish<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> talk of various kinds,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Tales of kings,<br />
					robbers,<br />
					and state officials;<br />
					tales of armies,<br />
					panics,<br />
					and battles;<br />
					talk about foods and drinks,<br />
					and clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					and perfumes;<br />
					talk about relatives;<br />
					talk about carriages,<br />
					villages,<br />
					towns,<br />
					cities,<br />
					and countries;<br />
					talk about women,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					talk of heroes;<br />
					gossip from street-corners<br />
					and the places for drawing water;<br />
					ghost-stories:<br />
					desultory talk;<br />
					speculative talk on the world and the sea;<br />
					on existence and non-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And Nigrodha the Wanderer<br />
					saw the householder Sandhāna approaching in the distance,<br />
					and called his own company to order,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be still, sirs, and make no noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is a disciple of the Samaṇa Gotama coming,<br />
					the householder Sandhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever white-robed lay disciples of Gotama<br />
					there be dwelling at Rājagaha,<br />
					this Sandhāna is one of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now these good gentlemen<br />
					delight in quiet;<br />
					they are trained in quiet;<br />
					they speak in praise of quiet.</p>

					<p class="f4">How well it were<br />
					if seeing how quiet the assembly is,<br />
					he should see fit to join us.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he spake thus,<br />
					the Wanderers kept silence.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now the householder Sandhāna came on to where Nigrodha the Wanderer was,<br />
					and exchanged with him the greetings and compliments of civility and courtesy,<br />
					and sat down beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, Sandhāna said to Nigrodha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Different is the way<br />
					in which these reverend Wanderers,<br />
					holding views of their own,<br />
					talk when they have met<br />
					and are come together,<br />
					from the practice of the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">They talk with loud voices,<br />
					with noise and clamour,<br />
					carrying on childish <a id="pg35"><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span></a> talk of vanous kinds, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Tales of kings,<br />
					robbers,<br />
					and state officials;<br />
					tales of armies,<br />
					panics,<br />
					and battles;<br />
					talk about foods and drinks,<br />
					and clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					and perfumes;<br />
					talk about relatives;<br />
					talk about carriages,<br />
					villages,<br />
					towns,<br />
					cities,<br />
					and countries;<br />
					talk about women,<br />
					talk of heroes;<br />
					gossip from street-corners<br />
					and the places for drawing water;<br />
					ghost-stories:<br />
					desultory talk;<br />
					speculative talk on the world and the sea;<br />
					on existence and non-existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One haunts the lonely and remote recesses of the forest,<br />
					where noise,<br />
					where sound there hardly is,<br />
					where the breezes from the pastures blow,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					yet which are hidden from the eyes of men,<br />
					suitable for self-communing."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5">5.</a> And when Sandhāna had spoken,<br />
					Nigrodha to him made answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Look you now, householder,<br />
					know you with whom the Samaṇa Gotama talks?</p>

					<p class="f4">With whom he holds conversation?</p>

					<p class="f4">By intercourse with whom<br />
					does he attain to lucidity in wisdom?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Samaṇa Gotama's insight is ruined<br />
					by his habit of seclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not at home<br />
					in conducting an assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not ready in conversation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is occupied only<br />
					with the fringes of things.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a one-eyed cow<br />
					that, walking in a circles<br />
					follows only the outskirts,<br />
					so is the Samaṇa Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why forsooth, householder,<br />
					if the Samaṇa Gotama were to come to this assembly,<br />
					with a single question only<br />
					could we settle him;<br />
					yea, methinks we could roll him over<br />
					like an empty pot.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Now the Exalted One heard<br />
					with his clairaudient sense of hearing,<br />
					pure, and surpassing that of man,<br />
					this conversation between Sandhāna the householder<br />
					and Nigrodha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">And descending <a id="pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></a> from the Vulture's Peak,<br />
					he came to the Peacocks' Feeding-ground<br />
					on the bank of the Sumāgadha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and there walked to and fro<br />
					in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nigrodha saw him thus walking,<br />
					and on seeing him<br />
					he called his company to order, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be still, sirs, and make no noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Samaṇa Gotama is walking to and fro in the open air<br />
					at the Peacocks' Feeding-ground,<br />
					by the bank of the Sumāgadha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this good gentleman delights in quiet,<br />
					speaks in praise of quiet;<br />
					how well it were<br />
					if, seeing how quiet the assembly is,<br />
					he should see fit to join us.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Samaṇa Gotama should come to this assembly,<br />
					we might ask him this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">What, lord, is this religion of the Exalted one<br />
					wherein he trains his disciples,<br />
					and which those disciples,<br />
					so trained by the Exalted One as to win comfort,<br />
					acknowledge to be their utmost support<br />
					and the fundamental principle of righteousness?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When he had said this<br />
					the Wanderers kept silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Then the Exalted One went up to Nigrodha the Wanderer,<br />
					and Nigrodha spake thus to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the lord the Exalted One approach.</p>

					<p class="f4">Welcome is the lord the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Long has the lord the Exalted One taken<br />
					ere deciding on this step<br />
					of coming hither.</p>

					<p class="f4">May it please the lord the Exalted One<br />
					to take a seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is one ready."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One sat down on the seat made ready,<br />
					and Nigrodha, taking a low seat,<br />
					sat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him so seated<br />
					the Exalted One spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"On what talk, Nigrodha,<br />
					are ye here and now engaged<br />
					as ye sit together,<br />
					and what conversation between you<br />
					have I interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Nigrodha replied to the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, we have just seen the Exalted <a id="pg37"><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></a> One<br />
					walking in the open air<br />
					at the Peacocks' Feeding-ground,<br />
					by the Sumāgadha,<br />
					and seeing him thus, we said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If the Samaṇa Gotama should come to this assembly,<br />
					we could ask him this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">What, lord, is this religion of the Exalted one<br />
					wherein he trains his disciples,<br />
					and which those disciples,<br />
					so trained by the Exalted One as to win comfort,<br />
					acknowledge to be their utmost support<br />
					and the fundamental principle of righteousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Difficult is it, Nigrodha,<br />
					for one of another view,<br />
					of another persuasion,<br />
					of another confession,<br />
					without practice and without teaching,<br />
					to understand that wherein I train my disciples,<br />
					and which they,<br />
					so trained as to win comfort,<br />
					acknowledge to be their utmost support<br />
					and the fundamental principle of righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now, Nigrodha,<br />
					ask me a question about your own doctrine,<br />
					about austere scrupulousness of life:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in what does the fulfilment,<br />
					in what does the non-fulfilment<br />
					of these self-mortifications consist?</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had said this,<br />
					the Wanderers exclaimed loudly,<br />
					with noise and clamour:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous is it, sir,<br />
					the great gifts and powers of the Samaṇa Gotama<br />
					in withholding his own theories<br />
					and inviting the discussion<br />
					of those of others!"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Then Nigrodha bade the Wanderers be quiet,<br />
					and spake thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We, lord, profess self-mortifying austerities;<br />
					we hold them to be essential;<br />
					we cleave to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what does the fulfilment,<br />
					in what does the non-fulfilment of them<br />
					consist?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="f4">"Suppose, Nigrodha, that an ascetic<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> goes naked,<br />
					is of certain loose habits,<br />
					licks his hands,<br />
					respects no 'Approach, sir',<br />
					nor 'Stop, sir';<br />
					accepts nothing expressly brought,<br />
					nor expressly prepared,<br />
					nor any invitations.</p>

					<p class="f4">He accepts nothing<br />
					taken from mouth of cooking-pot,<br />
					nor placed within the threshould,<br />
					nor within a mortar,<br />
					<a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a> nor among sticks,<br />
					nor within a quern;<br />
					nor anything from two eating together,<br />
					nor from a pregnant woman,<br />
					nor from a nursing mother,<br />
					nor from a woman in intercourse with a man,<br />
					nor food collected in drought,<br />
					nor from where a dog is,<br />
					nor from where flies are swarming,<br />
					nor will he accept fish or meat,<br />
					nor drink strong drink,<br />
					or intoxicants,<br />
					or gruel.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is either a one-houser,<br />
					a one-mouthful man;<br />
					or a two-houser,<br />
					a two-mouthful man;<br />
					or a three-houser,<br />
					a three-mouthful man;<br />
					or a four-houser,<br />
					a four-mouthful man;<br />
					or a five-houser,<br />
					a five-mouthful man;<br />
					or a six-houser,<br />
					a six-mouthful man;<br />
					or a seven-houser,<br />
					a seven-mouthful man.</p>

					<p class="f4">He maintains himself on one alms,<br />
					or he maintains himself on two alms,<br />
					or he maintains himself on three alms,<br />
					or he maintains himself on four alms,<br />
					or he maintains himself on five alms,<br />
					or he maintains himself on six alms,<br />
					or he maintains himself on seven alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes food once a day,<br />
					or he takes food once every two days,<br />
					or he takes food once every three days,<br />
					or he takes food once every four days,<br />
					or he takes food once every five days,<br />
					or he takes food once every six days,<br />
					or he takes food once every seven days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he dwell addicted<br />
					to the practice of taking food<br />
					according to rule,<br />
					at regular intervals,<br />
					up to even half a month.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feeds either on potherbs,<br />
					or wild rice,<br />
					or nivara seeds,<br />
					or leather parings,<br />
					or on hata,<br />
					or on the powder in rice rusks,<br />
					on rice-scum,<br />
					on flour of oil-seeds,<br />
					on grasses,<br />
					on cowdung,<br />
					on fruits and roots from the woods,<br />
					or on windfalls.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wears coarse hempen cloth,<br />
					coarse mixture cloth,<br />
					discarded corpse-cloths,<br />
					discarded rags,<br />
					or tirita-bark cloth;<br />
					or again,<br />
					he wears antelope-hide,<br />
					or strips of the same netted,<br />
					or kusa-fibre,<br />
					or bark garments,<br />
					or shale cloth,<br />
					or a human-hair blanket,<br />
					or a horse-hair blanket,<br />
					or an owl's-feather garment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a hair-and-beard plucker,<br />
					addicted to the practice<br />
					of plucking out both;<br />
					a stander-up;<br />
					a croucher on heels,<br />
					addicted to exerting himself<br />
					(to move forward) when thus squatting;<br />
					a bed-of-thorns man,<br />
					putting iron spikes or thorns on his couch;<br />
					he uses a plank-bed;<br />
					sleeps on the ground;<br />
					sleeps only on one side;<br />
					is a dust-and-dirt wearer<br />
					and an open-air man;<br />
					a where-you-will sitter;<br />
					a filth-eater,<br />
					addicted to the practice of eating such;<br />
					a non-drinker,<br />
					addicted to the practice<br />
					of never drinking (cold water);<br />
					an evening-for-third-time-man<br />
					addicted to the practice<br />
					of going down into water thrice a day.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Nigrodha?</p>

					<p class="f4">If these things be so,<br />
					is the austerity of self-mortification carried out,<br />
					or is it not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, lord, if these things be so,<br />
					the austerity of self-mortification is carried out,<br />
					and not the contrary."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, Nigrodha, affirm<br />
					that austerity by self- <a id="pg39"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span></a> mortification,<br />
					thus carried out,<br />
					involves blemish<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in several ways."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what way, lord,<br />
					do you affirm<br />
					that blemish ts involved?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In case, Nigrodha,<br />
					when an ascetic undertakes a course of austerity,<br />
					he, through that course,<br />
					becomes self-complacent,<br />
					his aim is satisfied.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now this, Nigrodha,<br />
					becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then again, Nigrodha,<br />
					when an ascetic undertakes a course of austerity,<br />
					he, through that undertaking,<br />
					exalts himself and despises others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					when an ascetic undertakes a course of austerity,<br />
					he, through that undertaking,<br />
					becomes inebriated and infatuated,<br />
					and grows careless.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					when an ascetic undertakes a course of austerity,<br />
					it procures for him<br />
					gifts, attention, and fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby he becomes complacent<br />
					and his aim is satisfied.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					by the winning of gifts, attentions, and fame,<br />
					the ascetic exalts himself<br />
					and despises others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					by the winning of gifts, attentions, and fame,<br />
					he becomes inebriated and infatuated,<br />
					and grows careless.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					when an ascetic undertakes a course of austerity,<br />
					he comes to make a distinction<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> in <a id="pg40"><span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span></a> foods, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This suits me;<br />
					this doesn't suit me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter kind he deliberately rejects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Over the former<br />
					he waxes greedy and infatuated,<br />
					and cleaves to them,<br />
					seeing not the danger in them,<br />
					discerning them not as unsafe,<br />
					and so enjoys them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					because of his longing for gifts, attentions and fame,<br />
					he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Rājas will pay me attentions,<br />
					and so will their officials;<br />
					so, too, will nobles,<br />
					brahmins,<br />
					householders<br />
					and founders of schools.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					an ascetic gets grumbling<br />
					at some recluse or brahmin,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'That man lives on all sorts of things:<br />
					things grown from tubers,<br />
					or shoots,<br />
					or berries,<br />
					or joints,<br />
					or fifthly, from seeds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					munching them all up together<br />
					with that wheel-less thunderbolt of a jawbone -<br />
					and they call him a holy man!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					an ascetic sees a certain recluse or brahmin<br />
					receiving attentions;<br />
					being revered,<br />
					honoured<br />
					and presented with offerings<br />
					by the citizens.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seeing this he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The citizens pay attentions to this fellow<br />
					who lives in luxury;<br />
					they revere and honour him,<br />
					and present him with offerings,<br />
					while to me<br />
					who, as ascetic,<br />
					live a really austere life,<br />
					they pay no attentions,<br />
					nor reverence,<br />
					nor honour,<br />
					nor offerings!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so he cherishes envy and grudging<br />
					at the citizens.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, Nigrodha,<br />
					an ascetic becomes one<br />
					who sits in public.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, too, becomes a blemish in the ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> And again, Nigrodha, the ascetic,<br />
					when on his round for alms among the people,<br />
					slinks along furtively<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">When I passed away from that state<br />

					— thus does he call to mind<br />
					his temporary states in days gone by<br />
					in all their details,<br />
					and in all their modes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you of that, Nigrodha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does the austerity by these things<br />
					become genuinely pure or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, lord, the austerity by these things<br />
					becomes genuinely pure<br />
					and not impure,<br />
					wins topmost rank<br />
					and reaches the pith."</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, Nigrodha,<br />
					not yet does the austerity win to topmost rank<br />
					and reach the pith,<br />
					although it does reach the underlying fibre."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">19. "But in what Way, lord,<br />
					does an austerity reach to the top<br />
					and to the pith?</p>

					<p class="f4">How well it were<br />
					if the Exalted One could make my austerities attain to the top<br />
					and to the pith!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Take the case, Nigrodha,<br />
					of an ascetic who is self-restrained<br />
					by the Restraint of the Fourfold Watch.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the Restraint of the Fourfold Watch?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is when an ascetic inflicts injury<br />
					on no living thing,<br />
					nor causes injury to be inflicted<br />
					on any living thing,<br />
					nor approves thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes not what is not given,<br />
					nor approves thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters no lies,<br />
					nor causes lies to be uttered,<br />
					nor approves thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">He craves not for the pleasures of sense,<br />
					nor leads others to crave for them,<br />
					nor approves thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is thus, Nigrodha,<br />
					that the ascetic becomes self-restrained<br />
					by the Restraint of the Fourfold-Watch.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that he is thus self-restrained,<br />
					and his austerity is made to consist in this,<br />
					he advances upward<br />
					and turns not back to lower things.</p>

					<p class="f4">He chooses some lonely spot<br />
					for his seat -<br />
					in the forest,<br />
					at the foot of a tree,<br />
					on the hillside,<br />
					in mountain glen,<br />
					or rocky cave,<br />
					in the charnel place,<br />
					or on a heap of straw in the open fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">And returning thither<br />
					after his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself<br />
					when his meal is done,<br />
					cross-legged,<br />
					keeping his body erect,<br />
					and his intelligence alert,<br />
					intent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the hankering after the World,<br />
					he abides with unhankering heart,<br />
					and purifies his mind of covetousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away the canker of ill-will,<br />
					he abides with heart free from enmity,<br />
					benevolent and compassionate towards every living thing,<br />
					and purifies his mind of malevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away sloth and torpor,<br />
					he abides clear of both;<br />
					conscious of light,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he purifies his mind of sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away flurry and worry,<br />
					he abides free from excitement;<br />
					with heart serene within,<br />
					he purifies his mind of flurry and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting away doubt,<br />
					he abides as one<br />
					who has passed beyond perplexity;<br />
					no longer in suspense<br />
					as to what is good,<br />
					he purifies his mind of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having put away those Five Hindrances,<br />
					and to weaken by insight<br />
					the strength of the things<br />
					that defile the heart,<br />
					abides letting his mind,<br />
					fraught with love,<br />
					pervade one quarter of the world,<br />
					and so too, the second quarter,<br />
					and so the third,<br />
					and so the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus the whole wide world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around<br />
					and everywhere,<br />
					and altogether<br />
					does he continue to pervade<br />
					with love-burdened thought,<br />
					abounding,<br />
					sublime,<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					free from hatred and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he lets his mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">He recalls to mind<br />
					his various temporary states in days gone by<br />

					— thus does he call to mind<br />

					in all their details,<br />

					<p class="f4">He with the pure deva-vision,<br />

					and take shape in another;<br />

					<p class="f4">But such and such beings,<br />

					<p class="f4">What think you of that, Nigrodha?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, lord, austerity by these things<br />

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Nigrodha, does austerity<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> When he had thus said,<br />

					<p class="f4">"You were saying to me just now, Nigrodha:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Samaṇa Gotama's insight is ruined<br />

					<p class="f4">He is not at home<br />
					in conducting an assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not ready in conversation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is occupied only with the fringes of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a one-eyed cow<br />

					<p class="f4">Why forsooth, householder,<br />
					if the Samaṇa Gotama were to come to this assembly,<br />
					with a single question only<br />
					could we settle him;<br />
					yea, methinks we could roll him over<br />
					like an empty pot.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then the lord<br />

					<p class="f4">When he had thus said,<br />

					<p class="f4">21. Now When the Exalted One perceived Nigrodha<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Pronounce Nigrô'dha. The conversation reported in this Suttanta is referred to above, I, 239.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Tiracchāna-kathā,</i> literally animal-talk, but the adjective 'animal' as applied to talk is meaningless to Europeans. Brutish, brutal, beastly would all be literal, but very bad renderings. The fact is that the mental attitude of Indians towards animals is quite different from our own. They regard animals as on a lower plane indeed than men, but different (not in kind), only in degree. They take for granted the very real relationship between men and animals which we fail to realize, and often deny. The phrase animal-talk is therefore untranslatable. Buddhaghosa (Sum. I, 89) says, not leading to heaven or to emancipation. This is good exegesis of the whole passage, but throws little light on the exact connotation of the particular phrase animal-talk. It was translated above at I, 13 by low, and at I, 245 by worldly. Neither of these gives the exact force of the original, which must be akin to childish. For as the child is to the man with us now, so then in India (only one stage removed) was the animal to the man.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Here the Siṇhalese MSS. again (as above I, 13) omit <i>purisa-kathan</i> - talk about men, the Siamese and Burmese modern printed editions inserting it. Probability is all on the side of the Siṇhalese. From the male standpoint, <i>all</i> the other subjects are about Ourselves, directly or indirectly, i.e. in relation to this or that; <i>itthi-kathā</i> is about Ourselves in relation to women. Hence, to add talk about men is entirely redundant and a later gloss.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Vijanavātāni.</i> Both reading and meaning are doubtful See Rhys Davids' <i>Quest of King Milinda</i> I, 30; E. Windisch, <i>Mara und Buddha,</i> 242; H. Oldenberg, <i>Vinaya</i> I, 367. The epithet is usually applied to a residence for members of the Order, but it is also applicable to a place of meditation. Both must be near enough to the homesteads for the confidence necessary to peace of mind, and yet far enough off to be free from disturbance. The first part of the word may well have been originally from v.rjana, as Buddhaghosa's explanation from jana seems very forced.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Cf. <i>M.</i> I, 82, 175; II, 209. <i>Veyyattiya = vyattibhāva.</i> By way of reply and rejoinder with whom? says Buddhaghosa. The word is not in Childers, but see Majjhima I, 82, 175; II, 208-g. Perhaps we should render lucidity and Wisdom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Antamantāni eva sevati.</i> Perhaps: 'so he keeps apart from others, in solitary places.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> A lotus-pool or tank in the park. Cf. <i>M.</i> II, I; <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.140.wood.pts.htm">A. I, 29I;</a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/11_elevens/an11.011.wood.pts.htm">V, 326</a> as to the Peacocks' Feeding-ground in the same park.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Ajjhāsayaɱ ādihrahmacariyaɱ.</i> Cf. above, II, p. 262, <i>n.</i> 2. (The reference has there, by a printer's error and our oversight, been made to refer to § 10, instead of to § 12, 1. 4.) In the present connexion the <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases <i>ajjhāsayaɱ</i> by <i>uttama-nissaya-bhūta q1ɱ,</i> and <i>ādibrahmacariyaɱ</i> by The Ariyan Path termed the ancient <i>brahmacariya</i> (holy life).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This question is referred to above, I, 239. The catalogue of austerities is identical with the list in that Suttanta where the various practices are explained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Tapassī</i> One who depends on <i>tapas,</i> austerities, self-mortification.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Upakki1eso.</i> An auxiliary or subsidiary corruption (no doubt with the connotation that it may lead on to worse), spot, flaw, defect, blemish.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Paripuṇṇa -saŋkappo ti a1am ettāvatā ti evaɱ pariyosita-saŋkappo:</i> <i>Comy.</i> his aims are completed means thinking: 'thus far is enough; my aims are ended.' Again: he thinks: 'Who is equal to me in this practice?' With this may be compared our comment on Dr. Neumann's different rendering in <i>M.</i> I, 192; III, 276; in <i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1902, p. 482.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Vodāsam āpajjati.</i> Buddhaghosa explains: dvedhaɱ āpajjati, dve bhāge karoti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> On these varieties of <i>bīja</i> see above, I, 6, n. 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> The sentence is not clear. The reading <i>asani-vicakka</i> is confirmed by <i>Saɱyutta</i> II, 229. As to the metaphor, the <i>Atthasālinī,</i> p. 404, has five, equally vigorous.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains: He sits in some meeting-(lit. seeing-) place, and where they can see him, he executes the bat-rite (cf. <i>Jāt</i> III, 235; IV, 299; I, 493) of hanging head downwards like a sleeping bat, the fivefold austerity (see ibid.) or stands on one leg, or worships the sun.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> <i>Attānaɱ adassayamāno.</i> Buddhaghosa thinks the negative <i>a-</i> in the latter word a mere particle.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Antaggahikā-diṭṭhi,</i> which the <i>Comy.</i> limits to the Annihilationist heresy <i>(ucchedanta);</i> cf. above, I, p. 46.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Sandiṭṭhi:</i> what he himself can see, says the <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> <i>Sārappattā. Sāra</i> (pith) is the usual Buddhist metaphor for the essence, the heart, root, or core of the matter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>Na bhāvitaɱ āsiɱsati.</i> Perhaps: he does not rest complacently on that in which he has so trained himself. But we follow Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> <i>Abhiharati,</i> paraphrased as <i>upari upari vaḍḍhati</i> - he grows upward upward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> See above, I, p. 82.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> This phrase was inadvertently omitted from the corresponding sentence in I, 82.</p>

					p. 318; II, pp. 219, 279, but not at p. 82.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Our modern tongues sadly lack a word for <i>muditā:</i> joy in others' good, the obverse, so to speak, of sympathy. We have only another obverse: malice, Schadenfreude!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Lit.: has reached the bark, as distinct from the pith <i>(sāra).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> See above, I, p. 90.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i>Bhonto sattā.</i> Cf. <i>bho satta,</i> Digha III, 89 f., and below, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p28">Sampasadaniya Suttanta,</a> § 17, n.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa imputes to Sandhāna the charitable intention of so forcing Nigrodha's hand as to bring about the Buddha's forgiveness of his insolent assertion (<a href="#p5">§ 5)</a>. By overthrowing this banner of conceit he would cause Nigrodha to reap lasting benefit.</p>
