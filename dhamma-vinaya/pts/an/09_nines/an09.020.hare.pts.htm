					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Long ago, householder, there lived a brahman called Velama.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gave very rich gifts, such as these:</p>

					<p class="f4">He gave eighty-four thousand golden bowls,<br />
					filled with silver;<br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand silver bowls,<br />
					filled with gold;<br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand copper bowls,<br />
					filled with treasure;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand steeds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with trappings of gold,<br />
					with banners of gold,<br />
					covered with nets of gold thread;<br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand chariots,<br />
					spread with lion-skins,<br />
					tiger-skins,<br />
					leopard-skins,<br />
					saffron-coloured blankets,<br />
					with golden trappings,<br />
					golden banners,<br />
					covered with nets of gold thread;<br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand milch kine,<br />
					with tethers of fine jute,<br />
					with milk-pails of silver;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand maidens<br />
					adorned with jewelled ear-rings;<br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand <a id="pg264"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span></a> couches,<br />
					spread with fleecy covers,<br />
					white blankets and woollen flower-embroidered coverlets,<br />
					covered with rugs of antelope skins,<br />
					with awnings above<br />
					and crimson cushions at each end<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he gave eighty-four thousand lengths<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> of cloth,<br />
					of finest flax,<br />
					of finest silk,<br />
					of finest wool,<br />
					of finest cotton.</p>

					<p class="f4">And who shall tell of the food and the drink that he gave,<br />
					food both hard and soft,<br />
					sweetmeats and syrups!</p>

					<p class="f4">They flowed, methinks, as rivers!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps, householder, you may think thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Maybe Velama, the brahman,<br />
					who made that very rich gift,<br />
					was someone else.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But think not so,<br />
					for it was I,<br />
					who at that time was Velama, the brahman;<br />
					it was I who made that very rich gift.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But when that alms was given, householder,<br />
					there was no one worthy to receive the gift;<br />
					there was none to sanctify that gift.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">For, though brahman Velama gave that very rich gift,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he fed one person of right view.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he fed a hundred persons of right view,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he fed one Once-returner.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he fed a hundred Once-returners,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he fed a hundred Non-returners,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he fed a hundred Arahants,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he fed one silent Buddha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he fed a hundred silent Buddhas,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he fed one Tathāgata, arahant, fully awake.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he fed the Order of monks,<br />
					with the Buddha at their head,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had <a id="pg265"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span></a> he built a monastery<br />
					for the use of the monks<br />
					of the Order of the surrounding country.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though with pious heart<br />
					he took refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma and the Order,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he with pious heart<br />
					undertaken to keep the precepts:<br />
					abstention from taking life,<br />
					from taking what is not given,<br />
					from carnal lusts,<br />
					from lying<br />
					and from intoxicating liquor,<br />
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though with pious heart<br />
					he undertook to keep these precepts,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he made become a mere passing fragrance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> of amity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he gave that very rich gift,<br />
					or though he made become just the fragrance of amity,<br />
					greater would have been the fruit thereof,<br />
					had he made become,<br />
					just for a finger-snap,<br />
					the thought of impermanence.'</p>
