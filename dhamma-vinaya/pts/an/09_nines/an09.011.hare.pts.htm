					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta came and visited him,<br />
					saluted and sat down at one,side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the venerable Sāriputta said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I have spent the rainy season here in Savatthī,<br />
					and I now wish to go into the country."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time, Sāriputta, to do as you think fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Sāriputta got up,<br />
					saluted<br />
					and took his departure,<br />
					keeping the Exalted One on his right.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after his departure a certain monk addressed the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the venerable Sāriputta has offended<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> me,<br />
					and without asking my pardon<br />
					has set out on a journey."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to a monk:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go thou, monk, and in my name bid Sāriputta come, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Teacher calls you, Sāriputta.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied the monk,<br />
					and (he went and gave the venerable Sāriputta the Exalted One's message).</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, reverend sir," he replied.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna and the venerable Ānanda, with their keys,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> from lodging to lodging, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Haste ye, reverend sirs, and come,<br />

					will now roar his lion's roar<br />
					in the presence of the Exalted One."</p>
