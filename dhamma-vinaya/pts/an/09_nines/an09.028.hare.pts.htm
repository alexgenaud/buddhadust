					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br />
					there the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, monks, for the Ariyan disciple<br />
					the fivefold dread and hatred has ceased,<br />
					and he is endowed with the four possessions of the Streamwinner,<br />
					he may, should he wish,<br />
					declare the self just by the self:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Destroyed for me is hell;<br />
					destroyed for me is rebirth in the womb of an animal;<br />
					destroyed for me is the realm of Petas;<br />
					destroyed for me is the untoward way,<br />
					the ill way,<br />
					the abyss.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am a Streamwinner,<br />
					not subject to any falling back,<br />
					assured and bound for the awakening."</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What fivefold dread and hatred has ceased?</p>

					<p class="f4">When, monks, the taker of life,<br />
					by reason of his taking life,<br />
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					he experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief;<br />
					but he who abstains from taking life<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					nor experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that dread and hatred has ceased for him,<br />
					who abstains from taking life.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When, monks, the taker of what is not given<br />
					by reason of his taking what is not given,<br />
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					he experiences in the mind<br />

					but he who abstains from taking what is not given<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					nor experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that dread and hatred has ceased for him,<br />
					who abstains from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When, monks, the lustful evil liver<br />
					by reason of his lustful evil living,<br />
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					he experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief;<br />
					but he who abstains from lustful evil living<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					nor experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that dread and hatred has ceased for him,<br />
					who abstains from lustful evil living.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When, monks,<br />
					the liar<br />
					by reason of his lying,<br />
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					he experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief;<br />
					but he who abstains from lying<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					nor experiences in the mind<br />
					pain and grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that dread and hatred has ceased for him,<br />
					who abstains from lying.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, monks,<br />
					he who indulges in spirituous liquor,<br />
					the cause of sloth,<br />
					by reason of indulging in spirituous liquor,<br />
					breeds dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					or when he breeds dread and hatred in the next world,<br />
					he experiences in the mind pain and grief;<br />
					but he who abstains from indulging in spirituous liquor<br />
					breeds no dread and hatred in this world,<br />
					nor in the next world,<br />
					nor experiences in the mind pain and grief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that dread and hatred has ceased for him,<br />

					<p class="f4">With what possessions of a Streamwinner is he endowed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein,  monks, the Ariyan disciple is endowed with unwavering faith in the Buddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					wholly awake,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and righteousness,<br />

					the Buddha,<br />
					the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is endowed with unwavering faith in Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well proclaimed is Dhamma by the Exalted One,<br />
					which is for every-day life,<br />
					not for another time;<br />
					it bids one come and see;<br />
					a guide to be understood by the intelligent,<br />
					each for himself.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed with unwavering faith in the Order:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well trained is the Order of the disciples of the Exalted One;<br />
					upright is their practice;<br />
					they are trained in method;<br />
					trained in the proper course<br />
					is the Order of the disciples of the Exalted One -<br />
					that is to say, the four pairs,<br />
					the eight groups of persons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the Exalted One's Order of disciples -<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">With virtues dear to Ariyans is he endowed,<br />
					which are unbroken and without a rent,<br />
					untarnished and without a blemish,<br />
					purifying,<br />
					praised by the wise,<br />
					uncontaminated<br />
					and conducive to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">With these four possessions of a Streamwinner is he endowed.</p>
