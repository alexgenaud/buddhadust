					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now two brahmans, skilled in metaphysics,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> visited the Exalted One and,<br />
					after greeting him and exchanging the usual compliments,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, they said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, Parana Kassapa,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> all-knowing, all-seeing,<br />

					<p class="f4">And he has thus declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With infinite knowledge I abide<br />
					knowing, seeing a finite<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> world!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Master Gotama, the Nigantha, Nataputta,<br />
					all-knowing, all-seeing,<br />
					also professes unlimited knowledge and purview:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether I walk, stand,<br />
					sleep or wake,<br />
					always,<br />
					ever,<br />
					knowledge and purview are present!'</p>

					<p class="f4">But he has thus declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">'With infinite knowledge I abide<br />
					knowing, seeing an infinite world!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two talkers on knowledge, Master Gotama,<br />
					of these two who contradict each other -<br />
					which of the two speaks the truth,<br />
					which lies?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, brahmans!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of these two talkers on knowledge,<br />
					of these two who contradict each other -<br />
					which of the two speaks the truth, which lies?' — Let be!</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you Dhamma, brahmans;<br />
					listen,<br />
					pay heed,<br />
					I will speak!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," they rejoined;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Imagine, brahmans, four men standing at the four corners of the world,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now suppose the man standing at the eastern corner were to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By walking I'll reach the end of the world!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though man's life-span were a hundred years<br />
					and he lived a hundred years<br />
					and walked for a hundred years -<br />

					and dispelling fatigue by sleep<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>-<br />

					<p class="f4">Not, brahmans, by such journeys<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					do I say that the world's end<br />
