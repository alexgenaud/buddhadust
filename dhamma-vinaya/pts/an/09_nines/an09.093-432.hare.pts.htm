<meta name="description" content="The E.M. Hare translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Nines, Suttas 93-432. The wheel 'repetition  series' on the understanding, etc. of passion, etc. 340 suttas grouped together. Seventeen concepts (passion, hatred, illusion, anger, enmity, hypocrisy, malice, envy, avarice, deceit, craftiness, obstinacy, impetuosity, pride, arrogance, intoxication and indolence) played off against 10 concepts (understanding, comprehension, exhaustion, abandonment, destruction, decay, freedom from desire, ending, quittance, and renunciation), played off against each of two sets of 9 concepts (1. the thought of foulness, of death, of the repulsiveness of food, of universal wretchedness, of impermanence, of ill inimpermanence, of no self in ill, of renunciation, of freedom from passions; and 2. the first musing (jhāna), second musing, third musing, fourth musing, sphere of infinite space, sphere of infinite consciousness, sphere of nothingness, sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, and the ending of perception and feeling). The Pali has been left in it's abbreviated state as for most users this will actually be easier to compare with the English than if fully rolled out. This is the first time these have been seen in English fully rolled out." />

					<h1>The Freedom from Desire for Indolence (b)</h1>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br />
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br />
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br />
					'Space is infinite'.</p>
