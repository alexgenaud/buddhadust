					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental bondage.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk as regards the lusts<br />
					is not completely free of passion,<br />
					nor of desire,<br />
					nor of fondness,<br />
					nor of thirst,<br />
					nor of fever,<br />
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br />
					nor of desire,<br />
					nor of fondness,<br />
					nor of thirst,<br />
					nor of fever,<br />
					nor of craving<br />
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br />
					devotion,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />
					it is the first mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk as regards the body<br />
					is not completely free of passion,<br />
					nor of desire,<br />
					nor of fondness,<br />
					nor of thirst,<br />
					nor of fever,<br />
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br />

					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br />
					devotion,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />
					it is the second mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk as regards shapes<br />
					is not completely free of passion,<br />
					nor of desire,<br />
					nor of fondness,<br />
					nor of thirst,<br />
					nor of fever,<br />
					nor of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br />

					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />
					it is the third mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk if,<br />
					after eating as much as his belly can hold,<br />
					he give himself over to the ease of bed,<br />
					of (lying on his) back,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of slumber<br />
					is not completely free of passion,<br />
					nor of desire,<br />
					nor of fondness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br />

					nor of thirst,<br />
					nor of fever,<br />
					nor of craving<br />
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br />
					devotion,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />
					it is the fourth mental bondage.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So, too, when a monk if he live the godly life<br />
					set on gaining some celestial body,<br />
					thinking by virtue,<br />
					practice,<br />
					austerity<br />
					or chastity<br />
					to become a deva,<br />
					or one of the retinue of a deva,<br />
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br />
					devotion,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					nor to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso is not completely free of passion,<br />
					nor of desire,<br />
					nor of fondness,<br />
