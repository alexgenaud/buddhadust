					<p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Meghiya was his attendant,<br />
					the Exalted One<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> stayed at Calika,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> on the hill there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Meghiya approached the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I would like to visit Jantugāma<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> for alms."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do now, Meghiya, as you think timely."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Meghiya,<br />
					dressing himself before noon,<br />
					taking bowl and robe,<br />
					entered Jantugāma for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had wandered about for alms<br />
					and returned therefrom<br />
					<a id="pg235"><span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span></a> and finished his meal,<br />
					he came to the bank of the Kimikaḷa<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, while stretching his legs<br />
					and roaming to and fro<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> along the river bank,<br />
					the venerable Meghiya saw a mango grove,<br />
					pleasing and beautiful;<br />
					and at the sight, he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, this mango grove is pleasing and beautiful;<br />
					meet, indeed, is it to strive here,<br />
					for a clansman wanting to strive!</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br />
					I will come and strive in this mango grove."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Meghiya returned to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side<br />
					and (told him all that had taken place, adding):</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the Exalted One permit me,<br />
					I will go to that mango grove and strive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Stay awhile, Meghiya,<br />
					till some other monk appear,<br />
					for we are alone."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the venerable Meghiya spoke, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, for the Exalted One there is nothing further to be done;<br />
					there is no adding to his accomplishments.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for me, lord, there is more to be done;<br />
					to what is done,<br />
					there is (more) to be added.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br />
					I will go to that mango grove and strive."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stay awhile, Meghiya,<br />
					till some other monk appear,<br />
					for we are alone."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the venerable Meghiya spoke, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, for the Exalted One there is nothing further to be done;<br />
					there is no adding to his accomplishments.</p>

					<p class="f4">But for me, lord, there is more to be done;<br />
					to what is done<br />
					there is more to be added.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One permit me,<br />
					I will go to the mango grove and strive."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg236"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span></a> 'What can we say to you, Meghiya,<br />
					when you repeat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I would strive'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do now, Meghiya, as you think fit."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Meghiya rose from sitting,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One,<br />
					and keeping him on his right,<br />
					went to the mango grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having come,<br />
					he entered the grove and sat down at the foot of a tree<br />
					to spend the noon-day rest.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And there, in that mango grove,<br />
					three wicked, evil thoughts<br />
					kept coming to the venerable Meghiya -<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					sensual thoughts,<br />
					malign thoughts<br />
					and cruel thoughts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Meghiya wondered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is amazing and astonishing, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">By<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> faith alone<br />
					have I gone forth from home<br />
					to this homeless state;<br />
					yet I am still dogged<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> by these three wicked, evil thoughts:<br />
					sensual thoughts,<br />
					malign thoughts,<br />
					cruel thoughts."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Meghiya returned to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, while I stayed in that mango grove,<br />
					three wicked, evil thoughts kept coming to me:<br />
					sensual thoughts,<br />
					malign thoughts<br />
					and cruel thoughts;<br />
					and I thought how amazing and astonishing it was<br />
					that I had gone forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life by faith alone;<br />
					for, lord, I am still dogged by those three wicked, evil thoughts:<br />
					sensual thoughts,<br />
					malign thoughts,<br />
					cruel thoughts."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,<br />
					five conditions, Meghiya,<br />
					are conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Meghiya, a monk has a good friend,<br />
					a good companion,<br />
					a good comrade.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the emancipation of the mind of the unripe,<br />
					this is the first condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, a monk is virtuous<br />
					and dwells restrained by the restraint of the Obligations<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>
					he is perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br />
					seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br />
					undertaking the training,<br />
					he trains himself accordantly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg237"><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span></a> Then, Meghiya, that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					talk on wanting little,<br />
					on contentment,<br />
					on loneliness,<br />
					on going apart,<br />
					on strenuous endeavour,<br />
					on virtue,<br />
					on concentration,<br />
					on wisdom,<br />
					on emancipation,<br />
					on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br />
					- a monk obtains at will,<br />
					easily and without difficulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Meghiya, a monk dwells strenuous in purpose,<br />
					putting away unrighteous conditions,<br />
					taking to righteousness;<br />
					persevering and energetic,<br />
					he shirks not the burden of righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth thing to make become for conditions that wing to the awakening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Meghiya, a monk has wisdom<br />
					and is endowed therewith<br />
					as to the way of growth and decay,<br />
					with Ariyan penetration<br />
					concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Meghiya, is the fifth condition conducive to the ripening.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Meghiya, this may be expected of a monk,<br />
					who has a good friend,<br />
					companion, comrade:<br />
					he will be virtuous,<br />
					and dwell restrained by the restraint of the Obligations;<br />
					perfect in behaviour and habitude,<br />
					seeing danger in the smallest fault;<br />
					undertaking the training,<br />
					training himself accordantly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">This may also be expected of a monk,<br />
					who has a good friend,<br />
					companion, comrade:<br />
					that talk which is serious and a help to opening the heart -<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					talk on wanting little,<br />
					on contentment,<br />
					on loneliness,<br />
					on going apart,<br />
					on strenuous endeavour,<br />
					on virtue,<br />
					on concentration,<br />
					on wisdom,<br />
					on emancipation,<br />
					on the knowledge and vision of emancipation<br />
					- he will obtain at will,<br />
					easily and without difficulty.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover this may also be expected of a monk,<br />
					who has a good friend,<br />
					companion, comrade:<br />
					he will dwell strenuous in purpose,<br />
					putting away unrighteous conditions,<br />
					taking to righteousness;<br />
					persevering and energetic,<br />
					and will not shirk the burden of righteousness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And this may also be expected of a monk,<br />
					who has a good friend,<br />
					companion, comrade:<br />
					he will have wisdom<br />
					and be endowed therewith<br />
					as to the way of growth and decay,<br />

					concerning the way to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Meghiya, when that monk is established in those five conditions,<br />
					four more conditions must be made to become,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					(reflection on) foul things<br />
					must be made to become,<br />
					to put away passion;<br />
					(reflection on) amity<br />
					must be made to become,<br />
					to put away ill-will;<br />
					mindfulness in in-breathing and out-breathing<br />
					must be made to become,<br />
					to cut off distraction; the thought of impermanence<br />
					must be made to become,<br />
					to uproot the conceit 'I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For a monk, Meghiya, who thinks on impermanence,<br />
