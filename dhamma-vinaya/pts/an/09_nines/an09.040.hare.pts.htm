					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when bull or cow or young or baby elephant,<br />
					browsing on the grass-tops,<br />
					forestalls some forest tusker about to take his feed,<br />
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br />
					when bull or cow or young or baby elephant<br />
					devouring the bunches<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of broken boughs<br />
					forestalls some forest tusker about to take his feed,<br />
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br />
					when bull or cow or young or baby elephant,<br />
					<a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> stirring up the water with his trunk,<br />
					forestalls the forest tusker,<br />
					gone down to the water-hole<br />
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed;<br />
					when cow elephants go and rub against the body of the tusker, gone down to the water-hole,<br />
					so that he is plagued, provoked and vexed:<br />
					then, monks, the forest tusker thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I'faith, I live now in a crowd of bull elephants,<br />
					cow elephants,<br />
					young elephants,<br />
					baby elephants;<br />
					I eat merely grass-stubble;<br />
					they eat my bunches of broken boughs;<br />
					I drink muddied water;<br />
					and cow elephants come and rub against my body<br />
					when I've gone to the water-hole!</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I dwell alone,<br />
					withdrawn from the herd?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, monks, he dwells alone,<br />
					withdrawn from the herd;<br />
					and he eats uncropped grass,<br />
					and none devours his bunches of boughs;<br />
					he drinks unmuddied water,<br />
					and cow elephants come not and rub against him in the water-hole.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the past I dwelt in a crowd of bull elephants,<br />
					cow elephants,<br />
					young elephants,<br />
					baby elephants;<br />
					I ate merely grass-stubble;<br />
					they ate my bunches of broken boughs;<br />
					I drank muddied water;<br />
					and cow elephants came and rubbed against my body<br />
					when I went to the water-hole;<br />
					but now I dwell alone,<br />
					withdrawn from the herd;<br />
					and I eat uncropped grass,<br />
					and none devours my bunches of boughs;<br />
					and I drink unmuddied water,<br />
					and cow elephants come not and rub against me in the water-hole.'</p>

					<p class="f4">and breaking off a bunch of boughs with his trunk,<br />
					he rubs his body with it and joyfully allays the itch.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is just so, monks,<br />
					when a monk lives in a crowd of monks, nuns, lay-disciples,<br />
					both men and women,<br />
					rajahs, their ministers,<br />
					course-setters and their disciples;<br />
					he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truly I now live in a crowd of monks, nuns, lay-disciples,<br />
					both men and women,<br />
					rajahs, their ministers,<br />
					course-setters and their disciples!</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to live alone,<br />
					withdrawn from the horde?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he resorts to some secluded dwelling:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> forest,<br />
					tree-root,<br />
					mountain,<br />
					glen,<br />
					cliff-cave,<br />
					cemetery,<br />
					wooded upland,<br />
					open space<br />
					or heap of straw -<br />
					and come to forest,<br />
					tree-root<br />
					or empty hut,<br />
					he sits crossed legged,<br />
					holds his body erect<br />
					and sets mindfulness before him.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And putting away worldly coveting,<br />
					he abides with mind freed therefrom;<br />
					he purges his mind of coveting:<br />
					putting away ill-will and hatred,<br />
					he abides with mind free therefrom;<br />
					kindly, compassionate towards all creatures,<br />
					he purges his mind of ill-will and hatred;<br />
					putting away sloth and torpor,<br />
					he abides freed therefrom;<br />
					conscious,<br />
					alert,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					mindful,<br />
					self-possessed,<br />
					he purges his mind of sloth and torpor:<br />
					putting away flurry and worry,<br />
					he abides unflurried;<br />
					with mind inwardly calmed,<br />
					he <a id="pg293"><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></a> purges his mind of flurry and worry;<br />
					putting away doubt,<br />
					he abides with doubt passed by;<br />
					no 'how? how?' questioner,<br />
					he purges his mind of doubt as to right things.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And putting away these five hindrances,<br />
					weakening the mind's corruptions<br />
					by wisdom,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					he enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br />
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br />
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br />
					'Space is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br />
					'Consciousness is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br />
					'There is nothing'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling<br />
					and seeing by wisdom that the cankers are completely destroyed, he rejoices greatly at having allayed the irritant."</p>
