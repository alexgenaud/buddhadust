					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed -<br />

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br />
