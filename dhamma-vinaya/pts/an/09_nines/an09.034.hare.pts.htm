					<p class="f4">There are, reverend sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are forms, cognized by the eye,<br />

					lovely,<br />

					<p class="f4">Consider, reverend sir, the monk who,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br />
					perceptions and thoughts<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> accompanied by sense desire beset him,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br />
					suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while he abides in that abiding,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br />

					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br />
					by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, consider, reverend sir, the monk who<br />
