					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near <i>Sāvatthī</i>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park,<br />
					the venerable Nandaka<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> gave Dhamma discourse to the monks in the service hall;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					taught them,<br />
					roused them,<br />
					incited them<br />
					and gladdened them.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the evening<br />
					the Exalted One rose from seclusion<br />
					and approached the service hall;<br />
					and having come,<br />
					he stood outside the doorway,<br />
					waiting for the discourse to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he knew that the discourse was ended,<br />
					he coughed and tapped on the bolt.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg238"><span class="f2 g"><b>[238]</b></span></a> Then those monks opened the door to the Exalted One,<br />
					and he entered the hall and sat down on the appointed seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had seated himself,<br />
					the Exalted One spoke thus to the venerable Nandaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Surely, Nandaka, this Dhamma discourse,<br />
					which you preached to the monks,<br />
					was a long one!</p>

					<p class="f4">My back ached as I stood outside the doorway, waiting for the discourse to end."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br />
					the venerable Nandaka, being embarrassed,<br />
					said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, lord, we knew not that the Exalted One stood outside the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had we known, lord, we would not have said so much."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One knew<br />
					that the venerable Nandaka was embarrassed,<br />
					so he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, well done, Nandaka!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is right for you clansmen,<br />
					who by faith have gone forth from the home to the homeless life,<br />
					when you may be seated around for Dhamma discourse!</p>

					<p class="f4">For you assembled, Nandaka, there are two courses:<br />
					either discourse on Dhamma<br />
					or maintain the Ariyan silence.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now there are, reverend sirs,<br />

					<p class="f4">Take the case, reverend sirs, of a monk,<br />

					the godly life,<br />
					perfect and pure in its entirety,<br />
					just so often is the Teacher dear to him,<br />
					loved,<br />
					esteemed<br />
					and reverenced by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, sirs, is the first advantage<br />
					from listening to Dhamma at the proper time<br />
					and from Dhamma talks at the proper time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, take the case, reverend sirs, of a monk,<br />
					who teaches the monks Dhamma,<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle<br />
					and lovely in the end,<br />
					setting forth both in spirit<br />
					and in letter<br />
					the godly life,<br />
					perfect and pure in its entirety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sirs, as often as the monk teaches the monks Dhamma,<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle and lovely in the end,<br />
					setting forth both in spirit<br />
					and in letter<br />
					the godly life,<br />
					perfect and pure in its entirety,<br />
					just so often is he a partaker<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the word <a id="pg240"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span></a> and in the meaning of this Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, reverend sirs, is the second advantage<br />
					from listening to Dhamma at the proper time<br />
					and from Dhamma talks at the proper time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, take the case, reverend sirs, of a monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">Reverend sirs, as often as the monk teaches the monks Dhamma,<br />

					the godly life,<br />
					perfect and pure in its entirety,<br />
					just so often does he see in that Dhamma,<br />
					as he penetrates it by wisdom,<br />
					its profound import.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, reverend sirs, is the third advantage<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, take the case, reverend sirs, of a monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth, this reverend sir has attained,<br />

					and from Dhamma talks at the proper time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, reverend sirs, in the case of a monk,<br />

					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle and lovely in the end,<br />
					setting forth both in spirit<br />
					and in letter<br />
					the godly life,<br />
					perfect and pure in its entirety -<br />
					as soon as the monk teaches Dhamma<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle and lovely in the end,<br />
					setting forth both in spirit<br />
					and in letter<br />
					the godly life,<br />
					perfect and pure in its entirety,<br />
					everywhere those monks,<br />
					who are but learners,<br />
					who have not attained mastery of the mind,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					abide resolved on the unsurpassed peace from effort;<br />
					and having heard that Dhamma,<br />
					strive with zeal to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the arahant monks there,<br />
					who have destroyed the cankers,<br />
					lived the godly life,<br />
					done what was to be done,<br />
					laid down the burden,<br />
					attained perfection,<br />
					burst the bonds of becoming<br />
					and are freed through perfect knowledge -<br />
					on hearing Dhamma,<br />
					dwell comfortably here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, reverend sirs, is the fifth advantage<br />
					from listening to Dhamma at the proper time<br />
					and from Dhamma talks at the proper time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sirs, these are the five advantages<br />
