						<div class="floatrpp wpx450 marl6">
							<p class="f2"><i>Dh.S.: A Buddhist Manual of Psychological Ethics,</i> C.A.F. Rhys Davids, trans.: <b>§7:</b> What on that occasion is application of mind <i>(vitakko)</i>? The discrimination, the application, which on that occsion is the disposing, the fixing, the focussing, the superposing of the mind, right disposing - this is the application that there then is. fn: <i>Vitakko</i> and <i>vicāro</i> is a pair of terms which it is hard to fit with any one pair of English words. It is very possible that academic teaching came to attach a more pregnant and specialized import to them than was conveyed in popular and purely ethical usage. <i>Cf.</i> <i>M.</i> i, Suttas <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p19">xix</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p20">xx,</a> where <i>vitakkā</i> would be adequately rendered by ideas, notions, or thoughts. In <i>Asl.</i> 114, 115, on the other hand (<i>cf.</i> <i>Mil.</i> 62, 63), the relation of the two to <i>cittaɱ</i> and to each other is set out with much metaphor, if with too little psychological grasp. <i>Vitakko</i> is destinctively mental procedure at the inception of a train of thought, the deliberate movement of voluntary attention. As king ascends to his palace leaning on the arm of favourite or relative, so mind, or consciousness, ascends to its object depending upon the apprehensive act (<i>vitakko;</i> <i>As.</i> 114). Other metaphorical attributes are its impingeing upon, circum-impingeing upon <i>(paryāhanaɱ),</i> the object, and, again, bringing it near. Hence in selecting "application" in preference to "reasoning", by which <i>vitakko</i> has often been translated, I wished to bring out this graspoing, apprehending, reaching-out act of the mind, this incipient fetch of the consciousness elaborated in the Buddhist scholastic analysis of the term. Yet, just as applied thinking may include "reasoning" or "ratiocination", so <i>vitakko</i> is, in the reply, described by <i>takko,</i> the term used for ratiocinative procedure, argument, or logic (<i>cf.</i> <i>D.</i> i, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p12">12,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p21">21</a>). "What," asks the <i>Cy.,</i> "does one reason about <i>(takkesi)?</i> About a pot, a cart, the distance of anything. Well, <i>vitakko</i> is a stronger reasoning."</p>

							<p class="f2"><i>Vicāro,</i> as compared with <i>vitakko,</i> was used to express the movement and maintenance of the voluntary thought-continuum, as distinguished from the initiative grappling with the subject of reflection. Examining in detail, as compared with grasping the whole, is also read into it by commentators (<i>Asl.</i> 114). It is a pounding up <i>(anumajjanaɱ),</i> as well as a linking together. Metaphors are multiplied, to show its relation to vitakko. It is as the reverberation of the beaten drum or bell is to the beating; as the planing movement of the bird's wings after the initial uspsoaring; as the buzzing of the bee when it has alighted on the lotus; as the scouring of the dirty bowl when clutched; as the manipulating hand of the potter, <i>vitakko</i> being represented by the hand which holds the clay to the wheel, and so on. "Investigation" would well represent the sustained activity; "analysis" the cogitation in details; "discursive thought" gives some of the import of both.</p>

							<p class="f2">and</p>

							<p class="f2"><b>§21:</b> What on that occasion is right intention <i>(sammā-sankappo)?</i> The answer is as for §7 <i>Vitakko.</i> fn: <i>Sankappo</i> is by the <i>Cy.</i> especially identified with the expression <i>cetaso abhiniropanā,</i> superposing of the mind, the disposition or adjustment of attention, that on which the heart is set, hence aspiration, intention, purpose, design. In <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.005.pali.bd.htm#pg27"><i>M.</i> ii, 27 f.,</a> it is said to arise out of <i>saññā</i> (perception).</p>
