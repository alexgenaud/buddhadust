					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">What nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br />
					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br />
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br />
					'Space is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br />
					'Consciousness is infinite'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br />
					'There is nothing'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg277"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span></a> Passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br />
