					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One said this to the Monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> long ago a battle raged between the devas and the Asuras,<br />
					and in that battle the Asuras won<br />
					and the devas were defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the defeated devas simply fled,<br />

					and the devas were defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the defeated devas simply fled,<br />
					with the Asuras facing north hot after them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Asuras give chase;<br />
					let us battle with them a third time!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time they fought<br />
					and the Asuras won<br />
					and the devas were defeated;<br />
					and defeated and fearful,<br />
					they just entered the deva city.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, thus gone to their city,<br />
					the devas thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now that we've come to the refuge for the fearful,<br />
					we will henceforth dwell by ourselves<br />
					and have no dealings with the Asuras.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Asuras thought also:</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, long ago (another) battle raged between the devas and Asuras;<br />
					but in that fight the devas won<br />
					and the Asuras were defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the defeated Asuras fled,<br />
					pursued by the devas,<br />
					facing south.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the Asuras:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The devas pursue us;<br />
					what if we fight a second time!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And they did so<br />
					but in that fight the devas won<br />

					<p class="f4">And the defeated Asuras fled,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then thought the Asuras:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The devas pursue us;<br />

					they just entered<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the asura city;<br />

					<p class="f4">In just the same way, monks,<br />
					what time a monk,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time a monk<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br />

					<p class="f4">And Mara, the Evil One, thinks:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time a monk<br />
					free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br />
					"He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time a monk<br />
					by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br />
					enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br />
					and is free of ease and ill<br />
					he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now that I have come to the refuge for the fearful,<br />
					I will henceforth dwell by myself<br />
					and have no dealings with Mara.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when a monk<br />
					by passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br />
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br />
					enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br />
					'Space is infinite'<br />
					he is said to have put a darkness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> about Mara,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, when a monk<br />
