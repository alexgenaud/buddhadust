					<p class="f4">Once, when the venerable Ānanda was dwelling near Kosambī in Ghosita Park, the venerable Udāyin visited him<br />
					and, after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so seated, he said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Wisdom-freed, wisdom-freed,' he is called, sir;<br />
					and as to what has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of zest and ease<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					wherein the mind becomes calm and one-pointed<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br />
					"He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease,"<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					by putting away ease and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery he was wont to feel,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness and poise<br />
					and is free of ease and ill<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					by passing wholly beyond perceptions of form,<br />
					by the passing away of the perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					unattentive to the perceptions of the manifold,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite space, thinking:<br />
					'Space is infinite'<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>


					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness, thinking:<br />
					'Consciousness is infinite'<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness, thinking:<br />
					'There is nothing'<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br />
					he enters and abides in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, in one particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, consider, sir, the monk who,<br />
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					he enters and abides in the ending of perception and feeling<br />
					and seeing by wisdom that the cankers are completely destroyed<br />
					and by wisdom understands it -<br />
					thus far, sir, and with no (further) particular<br />
					has the wisdom-freed been declared by the Exalted One.</p>
