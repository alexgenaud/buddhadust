					<p class="f4">At Savatthī the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the Observance day,<br />
					when kept and held with nine qualifications,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is very fruitful,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					very splendid,<br />
					very thrilling.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is the Observance day,<br />
					when kept and held with nine qualifications,<br />
					very fruitful,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					very splendid,<br />
					very thrilling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, monks, the Ariyan disciple who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants give up taking of life<br />
					and abstain therefrom;<br />
					they dwell meekly and kindly,<br />
					compassionately and mercifully to all beings,<br />
					laying aside stick and sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />
					will give up taking life and abstain therefrom;<br />
					I will dwell meekly and kindly,<br />
					compassionately and mercifully to all beings,<br />
					and lay aside both stick and sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this first qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants abstain from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">They dwell taking what is given,<br />
					expectant;<br />
					not stealing but holding themselves in purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />
					will abstain from taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, thereby,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this second qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants abstain from living the ungodly life;<br />
					living the godly life,<br />
					abiding apart,<br />
					they abstain from intercourse,<br />
					the village-practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />
					will abstain from living the ungodly life;<br />
					living the godly life,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, thereby,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this third qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants give up lying and abstain therefrom;<br />
					speaking the truth,<br />
					bondsmen to the truth,<br />
					trustworthy,<br />
					dependable,<br />
					they deceive no one in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />
					will give up lying and abstain therefrom;<br />

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this fourth qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants give up drinking strong drink,<br />
					the cause of sloth,<br />
					and abstain therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />
					will give up drinking strong drink,<br />
					the cause of sloth,<br />
					and abstain therefrom."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this fifth qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants have but one meal (a day),<br />
					abstaining from food at night<br />
					and at wrong times.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this sixth qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants abstain from looking on at shows and fairs,<br />
					where there is dancing,<br />
					singing and music;<br />
					from wearing, decorating or ornamenting themselves<br />
					with garlands, scents and salves.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, now, during this night and day,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this seventh qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"All their lives arahants give up the use of large and lofty beds and abstain therefrom;<br />
					they lie on low beds,<br />
					couches or strewn grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too, during this night and day,<br />
					abstaining from the use of a large or lofty bed,<br />
					will lie on a low one,<br />
					or on a couch,<br />
					or on strewn grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this eighth qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					dwells with his mind pervading with amity<br />
					one quarter of the world;<br />
					likewise the second,<br />
					third<br />
					and fourth quarter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And so the whole world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					he pervades with thoughts of amity,<br />
					far-reaching,<br />
					abounding,<br />
					measureless,<br />
					free from hatred and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, in this way,<br />
					I shall follow the example of arahants and keep the Observance."</p>

					<p class="f4">With this ninth qualification is it observed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when the Observance day is kept and held with these nine qualifications,<br />
					it is very fruitful,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					very splendid,<br />
					very thrilling.'</p>
