					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Savatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, monks, wanderers of other views should question you thus:</p>

The field is the Buddha's message; the harvester is the striver; the sickle is insight; the cutting time is reflection time; the stick is reflection on foul things; the fence is restraint; the cattle breaking in is the rising of passion; their ejection and his return to work is the destruction of passion and his return to reflection.</p>
