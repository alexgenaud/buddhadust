					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt among the Mallas<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> near their market-town called Uruvelakappa<br />
					and had one morning robed early,<br />
					taken bowl and cloak,<br />
					entered Uruvelakappa for alms,<br />
					gone his rounds,<br />
					returned and eaten his meal,<br />
					he called the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Prithee wait here, Ānanda,<br />
					while I am gone into Mahavana for the midday rest."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," he rejoined;<br />
					and the Exalted One entered Mahavana for the midday rest<br />
					and sat down at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the goodman, Tapussa, visited the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side;<br />
					and so seated, he said thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We householders, reverend Ānanda,<br />
					are pleasure-seekers,<br />
					pleasure-fond,<br />
					pleasure-doting,<br />
					pleasure-mad<br />
					and, being so,<br />
					it seems a real precipice to us,<br />
					this giving up of all;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					yet I've heard, reverend sir,<br />
					that in this Dhamma-discipline<br />
					the heart of every young monk<br />
					leaps up at this giving up,<br />
					becomes <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> calm, steadfast and inclined<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> thereto,<br />
					seeing it is the peace.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And just there, reverend sir,<br />
					is the difference in this Dhamma-discipline<br />
					'twixt monk and the many folk,<br />
					I mean in this giving up.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, indeed, is a topic for a talk, goodman!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us go and see the Exalted One;<br />
					we will visit him<br />
					and tell him the matter,<br />
					and as the Exalted One explains,<br />
					so we will bear it in mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, sir,'<br />
					replied the goodman to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda went<br />
					with the goodman, Tapussa,<br />
					and visited the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted and sat down at one side;<br />
					and the venerable Ānanda told the Exalted One all the goodman had said ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is verily so, Ānanda,<br />
					it is verily so!</p>

					<p class="f4">When I was but a being awakening, Ānanda,<br />
					and not wholly awakened,<br />
					ere there was full awakenment,<br />
					I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good is the giving up of all;<br />
					good it is to go apart<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					but my mind leapt not up,<br />
					became not calm,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					nor inclined to this giving up<br />
					though I saw:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is the peace."'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what's the cause, the reason <i>my mind leaps not up,<br />
					becomes not calm,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					nor inclined to this giving up<br />
					though I saw:</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"It is the peace."'?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The peril of pleasures is not seen by me,<br />
					its not made much of by me;<br />
					the advantage of this giving up<br />
					is not won,<br />
					is not enjoyed<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> by me;<br />
					so my mind leaps not up,<br />
					becomes calm,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					nor inclined to this giving up<br />
					though I see it is the peace.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, seeing the peril of pleasures,<br />
					I were to make much of it;<br />
					if, winning the advantage of this giving up,<br />
					I were to enjoy it;<br />
					it would surely happen<br />
					that my mind would leap up,<br />
					become calm,<br />
					steadfast<br />
					and inclined to this giving up<br />
					on seeing it to be the peace.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br />
					on seeing the peril<br />
					I made much <a id="pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> of it;<br />
					on winning the advantage<br />
					I enjoyed it;<br />
					and my mind leapt up,<br />
					became calm,<br />
					steadfast<br />
					and inclined to this giving up<br />
					on seeing it was the peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br />
					aloof from sense desires,<br />
					<i>aloof from evil ideas,</i><br />
					I entered and abode in the first musing;<br />
					but as I abode in this abiding,<br />
					thoughts and distractions<br />
					of a sensuous kind beset me;<br />
					and it was for me a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as some ill,<br />
					amounting to a disease,<br />
					might arise in some happy person, Ānanda,<br />
					even so such thoughts and distractions<br />
					of a sensuous kind beset me<br />
					and it was for me a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what's the cause,<br />
					the reason my mind leaps not up,<br />
					becomes not calm,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					nor inclined to this giving up of thoughts and distractions<br />
					of a sensuous kind,<br />
					though I saw:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is the peace."'?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to suppress applied and sustained thought ... and enter and abide in the second musing ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the third ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the fourth musing ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the sphere of infinite space ...</p>

					<p class="f4">of infinite consciousness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">of nothingness ...</p>

					<p class="f4">of neither perception nor non-perception<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> ... in the ending of perception and feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">And presently, Ānanda,<br />
					passing wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					I entered and abode in the ending of perception and feeling<br />
					and I saw by wisdom<br />
					that the cankers were completely destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so long, Ānanda,<br />
					as I attained not to,<br />
					emerged not from<br />
					these nine attainments of gradual abidings,<br />
					both forwards and backwards,<br />
					I realized not completely,<br />
					as one wholly awakened,<br />
					the full perfect awakening,<br />
					unsurpassed in the world<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Maras and Brahmas,<br />
					on earth with its recluses,<br />
					godly men,<br />
					devas and men;<br />
					but when I attained to<br />
					and emerged from<br />
					these abidings,<br />
					both forwards and backwards,<br />
					then, wholly awakened,<br />
					I realized completely<br />
					the full perfect awakening<br />
					unsurpassed in the world<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Maras and Brahmas,<br />
					on earth with its recluses,<br />
					godly men,<br />
					devas and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then knowledge and vision<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> rose up within me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Mind's release for me is unshakable,<br />
					this birth is final,<br />
					there is now no becoming again.'"</p>
