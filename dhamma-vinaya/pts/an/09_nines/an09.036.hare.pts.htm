							<p class="in2">Monks, it is said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I say canker-destruction depends on the sphere of nothingness.'</p>

							<p class="in2">And wherefore is this said?</p>

							<p class="in2">Consider the monk who,<br />

							<p class="in2">Whatever occurs there of form,<br />

							<p class="in2">He turns his mind away from such phenomena and, having done so,<br />

							<p class="in2">And steadfast therein he wins to canker-destruction;<br />

							<p class="in2">Monks, suppose an archer or his pupil<br />
