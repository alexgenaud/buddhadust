					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five forms of mental barrenness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk has doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whoso doubts and is perplexed about the Teacher,<br />
					is not certain<br />
					nor sure concerning him,<br />
					his heart inclines not to ardour,<br />
					devotion,<br />
					perseverance,<br />

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />
					it is the first mental barrenness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, when	he	is	angry with his fellows in the godly life,<br />

					<p class="f4">Where the heart does not so incline,<br />
