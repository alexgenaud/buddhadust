					save among those who have seen the bourn?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In bygone days, monks,<br />
					there was a teacher named Sunetta,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a course-setter,<br />
					who was free from all lustful passions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> he had many hundreds of disciples,<br />
					to whom he taught the doctrine of fellowship in Brahma's world.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And all they who grasped the word taught by Sunetta,<br />
					in its fullness,<br />
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					were reborn in the realm of bliss,<br />
					the Brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But of those who did not grasp the word in full,<br />
					some, after death,<br />
					were reborn into the fellowship of the devas<br />
					who have power over others' creations,<br />
					some among the devas who delight in creating,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span><br />
					some among the Tusita devas,<br />
					some among the Yama devas,<br />
					some among the devas of the Thirty,<br />
					some in the company of the Four Royal devas,<br />
					some among wealthy nobles,<br />
					some among wealthy brahmans<br />
					and some among wealthy householders.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Sunetta, the teacher, thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not seemly<br />
					that I should have precisely the same mode of existence<br />
					as my disciples after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to make amity<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span> become<br />
					to a perfect degree!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And Sunetta, the teacher,<br />
					cultivated the thought of amity<br />
					for seven years,<br />
					and then for seven world-cycles<br />
					returned not to this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the world rolled on, he arose in the sphere of Radiance;<br />
					then when the world rolled back,<br />
					he arose in Brahmā's empty palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he became Brahmā,<br />
					the conqueror,<br />
					unconquered,<br />
					all-seeing,<br />
					all-powerful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirty-six times he was Sakka, the deva-king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Many time seven he was a Wheel-turning rajah,<br />
					just,<br />
					righteous,<br />
					conquering the fur ends of the earth,<br />
					bringing stability to the country,<br />
					possessing the seven gems.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, monks,<br />
					although Sunetta lived so long<br />
					and lasted such a time,<br />
					he was not freed from birth,<br />
					old age and death,<br />
					from weeping and lamentation,<br />
					from pain,<br />
					grief<br />
					and tribulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was not freed from ill, I say.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the reason?</p>

					<p class="f4">It was by not being awake to,<br />
					by not penetrating four conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it was by not being awake to,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> by not penetrating <a id="pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> Ariyan right conduct;<br />
					it was by not being awake to,<br />
					by not penetrating Ariyan concentration;<br />
					it was by not being awake to,<br />
					by not penetrating Ariyan wisdom;<br />
					and it was by not being awake to,<br />
					by not penetrating Ariyan release.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, it is just this:</p>

					<p class="f4">when Ariyan right conduct<br />

					when Ariyan concentration<br />

					when Ariyan wisdom<br />
					is awakened and penetrated,<br />
					and when Ariyan release<br />
					is awakened and penetrated,<br />
					the craving for life is cut off,<br />
					the cord<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> that binds one to becoming<br />
					is destroyed<br />
					and there is no more coming-to-be.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Wellfarer had so spoken, the Teacher spoke again, and said:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Right conduct, concentration, wisdom, full release:<br />
