<meta name="description" content="E. M. Hare's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Sevens, Sutta 53. Maha Moggallāna questions a Brahma as to what the gods are able to see of Arahants, Non-returners, Once-returners, and Stream-entrants. It is interesting to note that indescribing the details of each stage it is shown that with proper practice Arahantship is attainable directly from that stage." />

					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> on Mount Vulture Peak,<br />
					two devas of surpassing loveliness,<br />
					lighting up almost the whole Peak,<br />
					approached the Exalted One at the passing of the night,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And standing there, one deva said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these nuns are freed!' -</p>

					<p class="f4">and the other said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these nuns are wholly freed<br />
					and without attached remainder.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake those devas,<br />
					and the Master approved;<br />
					and seeing that,<br />
					they saluted the Exalted One and,<br />
					keeping him on their right,<br />
					vanished thence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At dawn the Exalted One told the monks:

					Monks, at the passing of the night<br />
					two devas of surpassing loveliness,<br />
					lighting up almost the whole Peak,<br />
					approached me,<br />
					saluted<br />
					and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And standing there, one deva said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these nuns are freed!' -</p>

					<p class="f4">and the other said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these nuns are wholly freed<br />
					and without attached remainder.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time the venerable Mahā Moggallāna sat near the Exalted One;<br />
					and he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What devas know the partly attached<br />
					as partly attached,<br />
					the wholly detached<br />
					as wholly detached?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">About then a monk named Tissa had recently died<br />
					and had arisen in one of the Brahmā worlds;<br />
					and there they knew him as Brahmā Tissa the mighty,<br />
					the very powerful.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the venerable Mahā Moggallāna,<br />
					as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm<br />
					or bend his outstretched arm,<br />
					vanished from Mount Vulture Peak<br />
					and appeared in that Brahmā world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Brahmā Tissa saw the venerable one from afar, coming along,<br />
					and on seeing him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, worthy Moggallāna,<br />
					welcome, worthy Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tis <a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> long indeed since you made this round,<br />
					that is to say, came here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be seated, worthy sir, here on this seat made ready!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna sat down on the seat made ready,<br />
					and Brahmā Tissa, after saluting him,<br />
					also sat down - at one side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said to Brahmā Tissa, thus seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">'To what devas, Tissa, is there this knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that;<br />
					as to being wholly unattached, he is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Brahmā deva-hosts, worthy Moggallāna, have this knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that;<br />
					as to being wholly unattached, he is that</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					<p class="f4">'What, have they all this knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that;<br />
					as to being wholly unattached, he is that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'No, worthy sir, they do not all have this knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that;<br />
					as to being wholly unattached, he is that.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those devas who are satisfied with Brahmā life,<br />
					Brahmā beauty,<br />
					Brahmā happiness,<br />
					Brahmā pomp,<br />
					Brahmā power<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and know not the escape from it<br />
					to the beyond as there really<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> is,<br />
					they have not this knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that;<br />
					as to being wholly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those devas of the Brahmā hosts<br />
					who are not satisfied with Brahmā life,<br />
					Brahmā beauty,<br />
					Brahmā happiness,<br />
					Brahmā pomp,<br />
					Brahmā power<br />
					and know the escape from it<br />
					to the beyond as there really is,<br />
					they have this knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that;<br />
					as to being wholly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Consider, worthy Moggallāna,<br />
					the monk who is freed-both-ways;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of him those devas know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is freed-both-ways,<br />
					and so long as his body lasts,<br />
					devas and men shall see him,<br />
					but on the breaking up of the body<br />
					they shall not see him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, worthy sir,<br />
					that these devas have the knowledge:<br />
					As to being wholly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Again, consider him who is wisdom-freed<br />
					of him those devas know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is wisdom-freed,<br />
					and so long as his body lasts,<br />
					devas and men shall see him,<br />
					but on the breaking up of the body<br />
					they shall not see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, worthy sir,<br />
					that these devas have the knowledge:<br />
					As to being wholly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Consider the monk who is a seer-in-body;<br />
					of him they know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is a seer-in-body;<br />
					perhaps by practising things meet<br />
					as to sleeping and sitting,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					having fellowship with good <a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> friends,<br />
					controlling the faculties,<br />
					he may enter and abide in<br />
					that consummation beyond<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> all of the godly life,<br />
					realizing it here now by his own knowledge,<br />
					for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, worthy sir, that these devas have the knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. Consider him who is a view-winner;<br />
					of him they know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is a view-winner;<br />
					perhaps by practising things meet<br />
					as to sleeping and sitting,<br />
					having fellowship with good friends,<br />
					controlling the faculties,<br />
					he may enter and abide in<br />
					that consummation beyond all of the godly life,<br />
					realizing it here now by his own knowledge,<br />
					for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, worthy sir, that these devas have the knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Consider him who is faith-freed;<br />
					of him they know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is faith-freed;<br />
					perhaps by practising things meet<br />
					as to sleeping and sitting,<br />
					having fellowship with good friends,<br />
					controlling the faculties,<br />
					he may enter and abide in<br />
					that consummation beyond all of the godly life,<br />
					realizing it here now by his own knowledge,<br />
					for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, worthy sir, that these devas have the knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly unattached, he is that.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Consider him who is a Dhamma-follower;<br />
					of him they know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is a Dhamma-follower;<br />
					perhaps by practising things meet<br />
					as to sleeping and sitting,<br />
					having fellowship with good friends,<br />
					controlling the faculties,<br />
					he may enter and abide in<br />
					that consummation beyond all of the godly life,<br />
					realizing it here now by his own knowledge,<br />
					for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, worthy sir, that these devas have the knowledge:<br />
					As to being partly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> unattached, he is that.'</p>

					<p class="f4">10. And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, delighted,<br />
					pleased by Brahmā Tissa's words,<br />
					as a strong man might bend his arm to and fro,<br />
					vanished from the Brahmā world<br />
					and appeared on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he approached the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, seated thus, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna related to the Exalted One all that talk he had had with Brahmā Tissa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'But Brahmā Tissa did not teach you the seventh person, Moggallāna,<br />
					the dweller<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> in the signless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now is the time, O Blessed One,<br />
					now is the time, O Well-farer!</p>

					<p class="f4">Were the Exalted One to teach concerning the dweller in the signless,<br />
					the monks would hear and remember.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wherefore, Moggallāna, listen,<br />
					pay heed,<br />
					I will speak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' rejoined the venerable Mahā Moggallāna; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">11. 'Consider, Moggallāna, the monk who,<br />
					by inattention to all signs,<br />
					enters and abides in signless mental concentration<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					<a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> of him those devas know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir is a dweller in the signless;<br />
					of him they know:</p>

					<p class="f4">This reverend sir abides in signless mental concentration;<br />
					perhaps by practising things meet<br />
					as to sleeping and sitting,<br />
					having fellowship with good friends,<br />
					controlling the faculties,<br />

					that consummation beyond all of the godly life,<br />
					realizing it here now by his own knowledge,<br />
					for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus it is, Moggallāna, that these devas have the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">As to being partly unattached, he is that.'</p>
