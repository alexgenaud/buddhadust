					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a> in Ghosita Park,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda dressed early one morning<br />
					and with bowl and robe entered Kosambī for alms.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Kosambī for alms;<br />
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he approached their park;<br />
					and, having come,<br />
					greeted them,<br />
					exchanged the usual polite talk with them<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time this remark<br />
					by chance arose among them<br />
					as they sat assembled:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, whosoever lives the godly life in its fullness and purity for twelve years,<br />
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda neither belauded nor decried their words,<br />
					but got up and departed, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I shall learn the truth of this talk from the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when he had gone his round for alms in Kosambī<br />
					and returned and eaten his meal,<br />
					he approached the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted<br />
					and sat down at one side;<br />
					and so seated,<br />
					he told the Exalted One:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"This morning, lord, I robed early and, taking cloak and bowl, entered Kosambī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Kosambī for alms;<br />
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I approached their park;<br />

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, whosoever lives the godly life in its fullness and purity for twelve years,<br />

					<p class="f4">"The monk is praiseworthy."'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I neither belauded nor decried their words,<br />

					<p class="f4">'I shall learn the truth of this talk from the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> Is it possible, lord,<br />
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br />

					just merely on the score of years?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Ānanda, it is not possible in this Dhamma-discipline<br />
					to declare a monk praiseworthy<br />
					just merely on the score of years;<br />
					these seven grounds for praise<br />
					have been taught by me,<br />
					who have realized the matter by personal knowledge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, a monk has faith,<br />
					is conscientious,<br />
					afraid of blame,<br />
					has heard much,<br />
					is energetic,<br />
					mindful<br />
					and wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda,<br />
					these are the seven grounds for praise taught by me,<br />
					who have realized the matter by personal knowledge.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Ānanda, if a monk,<br />
					possessed of these seven grounds,<br />
					live the godly life in its fullness and purity<br />
					for twelve years,<br />
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">if he live the godly life<br />
					for twenty-four years<br />
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">for thirty-six years<br />
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">for forty-eight years,<br />
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy;'"</p>
