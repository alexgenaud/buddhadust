					<p class="f4">One morning, while the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove,</a> in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika's</a> Park;<br /> the venerable Sāriputta robed early and, taking cloak and bowl, entered Sāvatthī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sāriputta thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Too soon still is it to visit Sāvatthī for alms;<br />
					what if I go to the park of the wanderers of other views!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he approached their park;<br />
					and, having come,<br />
					greeted them,<br />
					exchanged the usual polite talk with them<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time this remark<br />
					by chance arose among them<br />
					as they sat assembled:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, whosoever lives the godly life<br />
					in its fullness and purity<br />
					for twelve years,<br />
					it is right to say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The monk is praiseworthy.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sāriputta neither belauded nor decried their words,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then when he had gone his round for alms in Sāvatthī<br />

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the monk who is keenly eager to undergo the training<br />
