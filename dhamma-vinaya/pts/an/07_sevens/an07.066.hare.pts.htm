On the surface just a borning repetitious sutta describing seven factors which a bhikkhu, desiring to abandon unrighteous ways, make righteousness become, should respect, revere and rely on. Totally obscured by the abbreviations here re-inserted is a thrilling picture of two great minds at play. A mind-wrestling competition which makes the lesson come alive." />

					<p class="f4">At <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a></p>

					this reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If a monk would abandon unrighteous ways,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable one:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, indeed, the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
