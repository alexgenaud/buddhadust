The time the ship is beached is like the time he dwells alone in the forest, practising musing. The daily drying of the stays by the wind and heat is like the withering of lust and craving by insight and knowledge; the nightly soaking by the winter rain is like the steeping of the heart in the joy and gladness of musing; the weakened state of the stays, dried by day and drenched by night, is like the weakened state of the 'fetters,' due to insight and knowledge. The storm of the rainy season is like the knowledge of the Way to arahantship; the ship's rottenness is like the attainment of the fruit of arahantship; the time and place of the rotting of the stays are like the destruction of the 'fetters' in the life of the arahant; the actual breaking up of the ship is like the passing away to the cool, without remainder, of the arahant.</p>
