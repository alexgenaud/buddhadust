					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#campa">Campā</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on the banks of lake Gaggarā,<br />
					a company of lay-disciples from Campā visited the venerable Sāriputta,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And seated thus, they said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">''Tis long, reverend<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> sir,<br />
					since we heard a Dhamma-talk from the Exalted One's mouth;<br />
					how good it would be to do so!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then come next Observance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> day, friends,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and maybe you'll hear a Dhamma-talk from the Exalted One's mouth'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, reverend sir,' they rejoined;<br />
					and getting up,<br />
					the lay-disciples from Campā saluted the venerable Sāriputta and departed,<br />
					keeping him on their right.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the day was come,<br />
					they approached the venerable one,<br />
					saluted<br />
					and stood at one side;<br />
					and with them the venerable Sāriputta visited the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> may a man's gift<br />
					be given here in such a way<br />
					as to become not great in fruit, great in profit;<br />
					and may the gift be given in such a way<br />
					as to become great in fruit, great in profit?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It may, Sāriputta.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>The text here for Sariptta's question reads: <i>"na mahapphalaɱ na mahānisaɱsaɱ."</i>, "not of great fruit not of great profit", but here and hereafter for Gotama's response reads: <i>mahapphalaɱ na mahānisaɱsaɱ.</i> 'of great fruit, not of great profit.' When Sāriputta then asks for a reasoned explanation, he alters his question to conform to the way in which Gotama states the matter. According to a note to the text the first 'na' in Sāriputta's question is left out in all mss. except T. M.<sub>6</sub>[Turnour Morris Mss]. In the concluding paragraph of the text the wording reverts to: <i>"na mahapphalaɱ na mahānisaɱsaɱ."</i>. The fact is that on the face of it the outcomes of the lesser gifts described here must surely be counted as being of great fruit, and that gifts of lesser scope than the examples given here are always spoken of as bearing great fruit. But as to profit the final outcome for the one giving to improve his mind conforms to the goal of the Dhamma and is shown to be the greater because of that. The most natural rendering would be for Sāriputta's question to have been "not of great fruit, not of great profit", then for Gotama's response to have been 'of great fruit, not of great profit', and then for Sariptutta to have altered his question to 'of great fruit of great profit' and for the conclusion to have been the sequence 'of great fruit, not of great profit'; 'of great fruit, of great profit.' It is a common occurance for suttas to conclude with a repetition of the opening statement, so it is likely that, the incorrect concusion was formed from Sāriputtas question rather than Gotama's first statement. I think we are being asked to make a distinction between 'fruit' and 'profit.' Bhks. Thanissaro and Bodhi, and Sister Upalavana all overlook this problem.</p>
