					<p class="f4">"Made become by me<br />
					is the thought of there being no self in ill;<br />
					I have passed on<br />
					from the old state to a better;<br />
					I have won the fruit of making-become!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then surely he is thoughtful.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, the thought of there being no self in ill,<br />
					when made become,<br />
					made an increase in,<br />
					is very fruitful,<br />
					of great advanntage,<br />
					plumbing the deathless,<br />
					having the deathless as its goal —<br />
					thus is this said;<br />
					and it is on this score it is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these seven thoughts,<br />
					when made become,<br />
					made an increase in,<br />
					are very fruitful,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					plumbing the deathless,<br />
					having the deathless as their goal.'</p>
