					<p class="f4">And Nanda's mother called a man and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lady," he replied, and<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> going to the monks' park, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is time, reverend sirs;<br />

					<p class="f4">And dressing early,<br />

					with much hard and soft food<br />
					and satisfied them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the venerable Sāriputta had eaten<br />
					and withdrawn his hand from the bowl,<br />
					Nanda's mother sat down at one side;<br />
					and he said to her, seated thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But who told you, O mother of Nanda,<br />
					of the coming of the monks of the Order?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir, I arose in the night before dawn,<br />
					I sang the 'Way to the Beyond' and was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then came the Royal deva Vessavana,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					perceiving I had finished,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Hail, august One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Prithee, let this Dhamma-hymn sung by me<br />

					<p class="f4">Reverend sir, let all the merit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> in this giving<br />
					be to the happiness of the Royal deva Vessavaṇa!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous and wonderful, O mother of Nanda,<br />
					that you should talk face to face<br />
					with a deva<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> so powerful,<br />
					so mighty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir, that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br />
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">Rajahs, for some reason,<br />
					took by force and slew my only son, Nanda,<br />
					who was dear and precious to me;<br />
					yet when the boy was seized<br />
					or being seized,<br />
					bound<br />
					or being bound,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous and wonderful, O mother of Nanda,<br />
					that you should have so purged the surges of the heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br />
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br />
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">When my husband died,<br />
					he rose among the yakkhas;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he revealed himself to me in his old form;<br />
					but I knew no disquietness of heart on that account."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a> "It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda,<br />
					that you should have so purged the surges of the heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br />
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br />
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I, a young girl,<br />
					was brought to my husband,<br />
					then but a youth,<br />
					I know of no trespass<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even in thought<br />
					against my husband,<br />
					how then in deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, that you should have so purged the surges of the heart."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br />
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br />
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I became a confessed lay-disciple,<br />
					I know of no intentional transgression<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of any step of the training."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, it is wonderful!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nor is that all, reverend sir,<br />
					that is not the only marvellous thing that has happened to me,<br />
					there is indeed another!</p>

					<p class="f4">For just as long as I wish,<br />
					being aloof from sense desires,<br />
					aloof from evil thoughts,<br />
					I enter and abide in the first musing,<br />
					where thought is speculative,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> deliberative,<br />
					where zest and ease are born of solitude:<br />
					suppressing such thought,<br />
					I enter and abide in the second musing,<br />
					where there is an inward tranquillizing of the mind,<br />
					a one-pointedness<br />
					free from speculation,<br />
					deliberation,<br />
					where zest and ease are born of concentration:<br />
					then, free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					I enter and abide in the third musing,<br />
					I abide poised,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					self-possessed,<br />
					I experience the ease of person whereof Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The poised and mindful dwells at ease":</p>

					<p class="f4">then by putting away ease,<br />
					by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of former weal and woe of mind,<br />
					I enter and abide in the fourth musing,<br />
					a purity that is poise and mindfulness,<br />
					which is neither ill nor ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, O mother of Nanda, it is wonderful!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir, that is not all, there is yet another marvellous thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">Those five lower fetters,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> declared by the Exalted One -<br />
					I perceive not one in myself unabandoned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is marvellous, wonderful, mother of Nanda!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta instructed Nanda's mother with Dhamma-talk,<br />
					incited her,<br />
					inspired her,<br />
					gladdened her;<br />
					and rising from his seat,<br />
					he departed.</p>
