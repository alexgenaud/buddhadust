					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, cumbered by these seven things<br />
					a monk is neither dear<br />
					nor pleasant<br />
					to his fellows in the godly life,<br />
					is not respected<br />
					nor what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the monk who is greedy of gain,<br />
					greedy of honour,<br />
					greedy of praise,<br />
					lacks conscientiousness and fear of blame,<br />
					is envious<br />
					and mean.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, cumbered by these seven things<br />
					he is neither dear<br />
					nor pleasant<br />
					to his fellows in the godly life,<br />
					is not respected<br />
					nor what he ought to become.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Hare omits the positive series. His use of the word 'cumbered' for the negative attributes makes the conversion to the positive awkward because one cannot say of an attribute that isn't there that it is an encumberance, or that one is unencumbered by it, but it has been left as is.</p>
