					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Sāvatthī,<br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these seven persons are gift-worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider some person who abides<br />
					seeing impermanence in all compounded things,<br />
					conscious of it,<br />
					aware of it,<br />
					at all times,<br />
					continually,<br />

					wisdom-emancipation,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					realizing it himself by knowledge<br />
					this, monks, is the first gift-worthy person<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>
