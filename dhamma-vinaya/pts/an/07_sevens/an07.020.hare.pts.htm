					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> on Mount Vulture Peak,<br />
					the Magadhan rajah, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/ajatasattu.htm">Ajātasattu</a>, the Videhan's<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> son,<br />
					wished to attack the Vajjians.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said he:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though they are so powerful and strong,<br />

					I'll destroy them,<br />
					I'll reduce these Vajjians to wretchedness and ruin!'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And Ajātasattu summoned the Magadhan chief minister,<br />
					brahman Vassakara, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go, brahman, visit the Exalted One<br />
					and in my name bow your head at his feet;<br />
					ask whether he be free of sickness,<br />
					of ailment,<br />
					at ease,<br />

					say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, rajah Ajātasattu salutes the Exalted One<br />
					and asks if he be in health."</p>

					<p class="f4">And speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Magadhan rajah, Ajātasattu, the Videhan's son,<br />
					is anxious to attack the Vajjians;<br />
					and he has declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though they be so powerful and strong,<br />
					I'll root them out,<br />
					I'll destroy them,<br />
					I'll reduce these Vajjians to wretchedness and ruin!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">As the Exalted One answers,<br />
					that study carefully and tell me.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> 'Yes, sir,' replied brahman Vassakara;<br />
					and he approached the Exalted One,<br />
					greeted him and,<br />
					after exchanging the usual polite talk,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Gotama, the rajah of Magadha, Ajātasattu, the Videhan's son,<br />
					bows his head at Master Gotama's feet,<br />
					and asks if he be in health."</p>

					<p class="f4">And speak thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Magadhan rajah, Ajātasattu, the Videhan's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Though they be so powerful and strong,<br />
					I'll root them out,<br />
					I'll destroy them,<br />
					I'll reduce these Vajjians to wretchedness and ruin!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Ānanda stood behind the Exalted One fanning him.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Vajjians are often assembled,<br />
					much in assembly?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians are often assembled,<br />
					much in assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as the Vajjians are often assembled,<br />
					much in assembly,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians sit down in concord,<br />
					rise up in concord,<br />
					do business in concord?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians sit down in concord,<br />
					rise up in concord,<br />
					do business in concord.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as they shall sit down in concord,<br />
					rise up in concord,<br />
					do business in concord,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians not decree the undecreed<br />
					nor repeal the decreed,<br />
					but conform to the ancient Vajjian laws as decreed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians do not decree the undecreed<br />
					nor repeal the decreed,<br />
					but conform to the ancient Vajjian laws as decreed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as they shall not decree the undecreed<br />
					nor repeal the decreed,<br />
					but conform to the ancient Vajjian laws as decreed,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate,<br />
					revere the Vajjian elders,<br />
					and hold they ought to be listened to?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate,<br />
					revere the Vajjian elders,<br />
					and hold they ought to be listened to.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as they shall honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate,<br />
					revere the Vajjian elders,<br />
					shall hold they ought to be listened to,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians not forcibly kidnap<br />
					and make live with them<br />
					women and girls of their own clan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians do not forcibly kidnap<br />
					and make live with them<br />
					women and girls of their own clan.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as they shall not forcibly kidnap<br />
					and make live with them<br />
					women and girls of their own clan,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate,<br />
					revere the Vajjian shrines<br />
					within and without (their borders),<br />
					and not fail to provide meet offerings<br />
					as given of yore,<br />
					made of yore?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate,<br />
					revere the Vajjian shrines<br />
					within and without (their borders),<br />
					and do not fail to provide meet offerings<br />
					as given of yore,<br />
					made of yore.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as they shall honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate,<br />
					revere the Vajjian shrines<br />
					within and without (their borders),<br />
					shall not fail to provide meet offerings<br />
					as given of yore,<br />
					made of yore,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What think you, Ānanda, have you heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do the Vajjians provide meet protection,<br />
					refuge,<br />
					shelter for Vajjian arahants<br />
					and is it known<br />
					that arahants from abroad<br />
					may come thither<br />
					and that those there dwell in comfort?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, lord, I have heard<br />
					the Vajjians provide meet protection,<br />
					refuge,<br />
					shelter for Vajjian arahants<br />
					and is it known<br />
					that arahants from abroad<br />
					may come thither<br />
					and that those there dwell in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, so long as meet protection,<br />
					refuge,<br />
					shelter shall be provided for Vajjian arahants<br />
					and it shall be known<br />
					that arahants from abroad<br />
					may come thither<br />
					and that those there dwell in comfort,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to brahman Vassakara:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I was once staying at Sārandada shrine near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					and there I taught the Vajjians<br />
					these seven things that cause not decline;<br />
					and so long, brahman,<br />
					as these seven things that cause not decline<br />
					shall endure among the Vajjians<br />
					and they conform thereto,<br />
					growth may be expected,<br />
					not decline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had spoken,<br />
					the Magadhan chief minister said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, Master Gotama,<br />
					possessed of any one of the things that cause not decline,<br />
					growth for the Vajjians may be expected,<br />
					not decline;<br />
					but what will be said if they have all seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">In sooth, Master Gotama,<br />
					the Vajjians cannot be overcome by the Magadhan rajah, Ajātasattu,<br />
					the Videhan's son,<br />
					that is not in battle,<br />
					but only by cunning,<br />
					by breaking up their alliance.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well, now we must be going<br />
					for we have much to do,<br />
					much business.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> 'Do as you think fit, brahman.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then brahman Vassakara,<br />
					pleased and gratified,<br />
					arose and departed.</p>
