<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Sutta 59 of the Aŋguttara Nikāya. The taming of a shrew. Anāthapiṇḍika's new daughter-in-law is haughty, thinking how great a family she had come from, and she was obstinate, violent, passionate, and cruel; refused to do her part towards her new father and mother, or her husband; and went about the house with harsh words and hard blows for everyone. Gotama describes seven types of wives and their destinies in the next world and she awakens to the Dhamma and is reformed." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park</p>

					<p class="f4">'And early one morning,<br />
					after robing himself,<br />
					the Exalted One, taking bowl and cloak,<br />
					went to the home of Anāthapiṇḍika, the householder;<br />
					and when he was come,<br />
					he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the people of the house were making a great noise and clatter;<br />
					and when Anāthapiṇḍika had come and saluted him<br />
					and had sat down at one side,<br />
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, housefather, do the people of your house<br />
					make all this din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like fisherfolk<br />
					with a great haul,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> methinks!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, it is Sujata,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> my daughter-in-law,<br />
					who lives with us.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is rich and has been brought here from a wealthy family.</p>

					<p class="f4">She pays no heed to her mother-in-law,<br />
					nor to her father-in-law,<br />
					nor to her husband;<br />
					neither does she venerate,<br />
					honour,<br />
					reverence<br />
					nor respect the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called to her, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, Sujata!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' she replied,<br />
					and came and saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sujata, a man may have these seven kinds of wives.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">One like a slayer,<br />
					one like a robber,<br />
					one like a mistress,<br />
					one like a mother,<br />
					one like a sister,<br />
					one like a companion<br />
					and one like a handmaid.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Sujata, are the seven;<br />
					and which of them are you?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> 'Lord, I do not fully understand<br />
					what the Exalted One has put so briefly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One would teach me Dhamma,<br />
					so that I may understand the meaning of the words<br />
					spoken so tersely by the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">' Then pay heed,<br />
					listen,<br />
					I will speak, Sujata.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' she replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">'Whoso is pitiless, corrupt in mind,<br />
							Neglecting husband and unamiable,<br />
							Inflamed by other men, a prostitute,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							On murder bent -<br />
							Let her be called: a slayer and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoso would rob her husband of his gains-<br />
							Though little be the profit that he makes,<br />
							Whether by craftsmanship, or from his trade,<br />
							Or by the plough -<br />
							Let her be called: a robber and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The slothful glutton, bent on doing nothing,<br />
							A gossip and a shrew with strident voice,<br />
							Who brings to low account her husband's zeal<br />
							And industry -<br />
							Let her be called: a mistress and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever and with loving sympathy,<br />
							Just as a mother for her only son,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							For husband cares, and o'er his stored-up wealth<br />
							Keeps watch and ward -<br />
							Let her be called: a mother and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Who holds her husband in the same regard<br />
							As younger sister holds the elder born,<br />
							The meek in heart, who in his every wish<br />
							Her husband serves -<br />
							Let her be called: a sister and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> And she who is as glad her lord to see<br />
							As boon companions long apart to meet,<br />
							A gracious character of gentle birth,<br />
							A fond helpmate -<br />
							Let her be called: companion and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">If fearless of the lash and stick,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> unmoved,<br />
							All things enduring, calm and pure in heart,<br />
							She bear obedience to her husband's word,<br />
							From anger free -<br />
							Let her be called: a handmaid<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> and a wife!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Now she who's called: a mistress, slayer, thief,<br />
							Who's harsh, immoral, lacking in respect,<br />
							When cometh death -<br />
							Will wander in the miseries of hell.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">But mother, sister or companion, slave,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
							In precept long established and restrained,<br />
							When cometh death -<br />
							Will wander in the happy heaven world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Sujata, are the seven kinds of wives a man may have;<br />
					and which of them are you?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One think of me as a handmaid<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> and a wife<br />
					from this day forth.'</p>
