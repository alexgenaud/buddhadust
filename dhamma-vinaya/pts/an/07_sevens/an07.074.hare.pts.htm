					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk is skilled in the discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of wbat seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows what is an offence;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">what is not;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">what is trifling;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">what is grave;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">he calls to mind divers dwellings in the past, to wit:<br />
					one birth, or two, or three, or four, or five,<br />
					or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty,<br />
					or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand,<br />
					or many an age of rolling on,<br />
					or many an age of rolling back,<br />
					or many an age of both rolling on and rolling back -<br />
					such an one I was by name,<br />
					of such a clan,<br />
					of such a caste,<br />
					such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br />
					such was the end of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away thence,<br />
					I arose in such a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, such was my name,<br />
					such my clan,<br />
					such my caste,<br />
					such my food,<br />
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br />
					such my end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away from there,<br />
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many a previous dwelling<br />
					he calls to mind<br />
					with its circumstances and details.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-eye sublime,<br />
					surpassing the eye of man<br />
					he sees and knows beings<br />
					in course of faring on -<br />
					beings lowly and exalted,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					happy and in woe,<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These worthies were given over to evil practices<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					were revilers of the Ariyans,<br />
					holders of wrong views,<br />
					men who have acquired this karma<br />
					from wrong views;<br />
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					have arisen in the untoward way,<br />
					the ill way,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these good sirs behaved rightly<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					were no revilers of the Ariyans,<br />
					held right views<br />
					and have acquired this karma therefrom;<br />
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					have arisen in the blissful heaven world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-eye<br />
					purified and surpassing the human eye,<br />
					he sees and knows beings<br />
					in course of faring on -<br />
					beings lowly and exalted,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					happy and in woe,<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br />
					which is cankerless,<br />
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br />
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, possessed of seven qualities, a monk is skilled in the discipline.</p>
