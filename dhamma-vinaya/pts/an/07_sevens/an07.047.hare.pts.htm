					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, brāhman Jānussoṇi said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's amazing, Master Gotama,<br />
					<br />
					amazing, Master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if, good Gotama,<br />
					one might set upright what had been upset,<br />
					or might disclose what was covered,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to one who had gone astray,<br />
					or might bring an oil-lamp into the darkness<br />
					so that those with vision might see material shapes -<br />
					even so is <i>Dhamma</i> made clear<br />
					in many a figure by the good Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge,<br />

					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the good Gotama accept me<br />
