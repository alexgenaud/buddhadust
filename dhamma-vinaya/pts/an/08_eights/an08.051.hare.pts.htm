The <i>Comy.</i> calls the town Kapilapura.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> According to V. A. Smith's map in <a href="../../../../resources/pdf/chwang_travels.pdf">Watters' <i>Chwang,</i></a> the distance between these two places is roughly 200 miles, as the crow flies; the Chinese pilgrim travelled via Rāmagāma, Kusinārā and Benares, a very wide detour. A near way must have followed the Hiraññavati (the Gandak) river.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Suna;</i> see p. 470 of the text; the <i>S.e.</i> of the <i>Comy.</i> reads <i>phoṭo</i> for <i>pāṭo.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Bhante.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The text reads <i>hoti</i> for <i>hohi</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> After the Buddha's death, Ānanda was charged before the Council of <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> with the offence of having persuaded the Buddha to allow women to become nuns, thereby causing the decay of the Order. See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/vp/03.cv/vp.03.cv.11.rdho.sbe.htm#pg380"><i>Vin.</i> ii, 289.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Vin.</i> ii, 255 here adds <i>khīrassa dāyikā;</i> the <i>S.e.</i> of <i>A.</i> also omits. For the full story of this incident see <i>J.</i> i, 49; <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-4.htm#p42">Warren's <i>Buddhism</i> 42</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Upasampadā.</i> The <i>Comy.</i> observes that both 'going forth' and full ordination is to be understood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Pavāraṇā.</i> It was the name given to the festival held at the termination of <i>Vassa,</i> the Buddhist Lent. It was an occasion for mutual confession of shortcomings between members of the Order. It appears to have lasted only one day.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The Commentator observes that he only briefly here deals with these eight and refers to the <i>Samanta-pāsādikā</i> for the full <i>Comy.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> The six rules (for novices), eating at wrong times, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Vacanapatha. Comy.</i> <i>ovādānusāsanadhammakathā;</i> see Rhys Davids at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/vp/03.cv/vp.03.cv.10.rdho.sbe.htm#pg324"><i>S.B.E.</i> xx, 324,</a> whom I follow. <i>P.E.D. s.v.</i> 'the (five) ways of speech' for which see <i>M.</i> i, 126; but this will not suit the context. F. L. Woodward in <i>Some Sayings</i> 122: 'The right of a sister to have speech among brethren.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Besides at <i>Vin., loc. cit.</i>, this simile recurs at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.005.pali.bd.htm#pg32"><i>M.</i> i, 32.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> has the same remark as on the <i>Vin.</i> passage, quoted in the translation, <i>op. cit.</i> 325: 'With lamps lit in pots they search for booty.' The simile recurs at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/02_nv/sn02.20.003.pali.bd.htm#p1"><i>S.</i> ii, 264</a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.20.003.rhyc.pts.htm#p1">(<i>K.S.</i> ii, 176),</a> and in the Tibetan version, see Rockhill, <i>loc. cit.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> <i>Setaṭṭhika,</i> perhaps mildew. <i>Comy.</i> explains thus: Some insect <i>(pāṇako)</i> bores the stem and the head of the paddy is not able to get the sap.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The text reads <i>mañjiṭṭhika,</i> with <i>v.l.</i> <i>mañje-.</i> <i>Comy.</i> and <i>S.e.</i> with <i>v.l.</i> The former explains: The end of the cane is red.</p>
