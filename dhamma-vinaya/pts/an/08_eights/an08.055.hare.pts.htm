					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Ujjaya,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the brāhman, visited the Exalted One and greeted him and,<br />
					after exchanging compliments of friendliness and courtesy,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke to the Exalted One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Gotama, we are desirous of going abroad.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let Master Gotama teach us such Dhamma<br />
					as may be to our advantage and happiness in this world,<br />
					to our advantage and happiness in the next.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, brāhman,<br />
					lead to a clansman's advantage and happiness here on earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Achievement in alertness,<br />
					achievement in wariness,<br />
					good company<br />
					and the even life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is achievement in alertness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, by whatsoever activity a clansman make his living,<br />
					whether by the plough,<br />
					by trading<br />
					or by cattle-herding,<br />
					by archery<br />
					or as a rajah's man,<br />
					or by any of the crafts -<br />
					he is deft and tireless;<br />
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br />
					into ways and means,<br />
					he is able to arrange and carry out his job.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in alertness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is achievement in wariness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, whatsoever wealth a clansman get together by work and zeal,<br />
					collect by the strength of his arm,<br />
					earn by the sweat of his brow<br />
					and justly obtain in a lawful manner -<br />
					such he husbands by watch and ward, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now how can I arrange<br />
					so that rajahs may not get this wealth out of me,<br />
					nor thieves filch it,<br />
					nor fire consume it,<br />
					nor water carry it off,<br />
					nor ill-disposed heirs make off with it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wariness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is good company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, in whatsoever village or market-town a clansman dwell,<br />
					he consorts,<br />
					converses,<br />
					engages in talk<br />
					with householders or householders' sons,<br />
					young men reared in virtue,<br />
					old men old in virtue,<br />
					full of faith,<br />
					virtue,<br />
					charity<br />
					and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He emulates the fullness of faith<br />
					in such as are full of faith;<br />
					he emulates the fullness of virtue<br />
					in such as are full of virtue;<br />
					he emulates the fullness of charity<br />
					in such as are full of charity;<br />
					he emulates the fullness of wisdom<br />
					in such as are full of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called good company.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brāhman is the even life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman<br />
					while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br />
					continues his business serenely,<br />
					not unduly elated or depressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus my income,<br />
					after deducting the loss,<br />
					will stand (at so much)<br />
					and my outgoings will not exceed my income."</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as one who carries scales,<br />
					or his apprentice,<br />
					knows, on holding up the balance,<br />
					that either by so much it has dipped down<br />
					or by so much it has tilted up;<br />
					even so, brāhman<br />
					a clansman experiencing both gain and loss<br />
					continues his business serenely,<br />
					neither unduly elated<br />
					nor unduly depressed,<br />
					but realizes that<br />
					after allowing for the loss<br />
					his income will stand at so much<br />
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, brāhman this clansman have but small earnings<br />
					and live on a grand scale,<br />
					it will be rumoured of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This clansman eats his wealth<br />
					like a fig-tree glutton."</p>

					<p class="f4">And if his earnings be great<br />
					and he live meanly,<br />
					rumour will say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This clansman will die like a starveling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore this clansman while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br />
					continues his business serenely,<br />
					not unduly elated or depressed,<br />
					but realizes that<br />
					after allowing for the loss<br />
					his income will stand at so much<br />
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the even life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman the four channels<br />
					for the flowing away of amassed wealth<br />
					are these:<br />
					looseness with women,<br />
					debauchery in drinking,<br />
					knavery in dice-play<br />
					and friendship,<br />
					companionship<br />
					and intimacy with evil doers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the case of a great reservoir<br />
					with only four inlets<br />
					and only four outlets,<br />
					if a man should close the inlets<br />
					and open the outlets<br />
					and there should be no proper fall of rain,<br />
					a lessening is to be expected<br />
					in that great reservoir<br />
					and not an increase;<br />
					even so, brāhman there are these four channels<br />
					for the flowing away of amassed wealth:<br />
					looseness with women,<br />
					debauchery in drinking,<br />
					knavery in dice-play<br />
					and friendship,<br />
					companionship<br />
					and intimacy with evil doers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Brāhman the four channels<br />
					for the flowing in of great wealth are these:<br />
					abstinence from looseness with women,<br />
					from debauchery in drinking,<br />
					from knavery in dice-play<br />
					and having friendship,<br />
					companionship<br />
					and intimacy with the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the case of the great reservoir,<br />
					with only four inlets<br />
					and only four outlets,<br />
					if a man should open the inlets<br />
					and close the outlets<br />
					and if there should be a proper fall of rain,<br />
					an increase may be expected in that great reservoir<br />
					and not a lessening;<br />
					even so, brāhman<br />
					there are these fpur channels<br />
					for the flowing in of great wealth:<br />
					abstinence from looseness with women,<br />
					from debauchery in drinking,<br />
					from knavery in dice-play<br />
					and the friendship,<br />
					companionship<br />
					and intimacy with the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brāhman are the four conditions,<br />
					which lead to a clansman's advantage and happiness here on earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, brāhman<br />
					lead to a clansman's advantage and happiness in the world to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Achievement in faith,<br />
					achievement in virtue,<br />
					achievement in charity<br />
					and achievement in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of a truth he is the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully awakened,<br />
					adept in knowledge and conduct,<br />
					well going,<br />
					a world-knower,<br />
					incomparable,<br />
					a tamer of tamable men,<br />
					among devas and men the teacher,<br />
					Buddha,<br />
					Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman abstains from taking life<br />
					from taking what is not given,<br />
					from carnal lusts,<br />
					from lying,<br />
					abstains from taking sloth-causing liquors, spirits, wines.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in charity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman dwells at home<br />
					with mind free of the stain of meanness;<br />
					freely bounteous,<br />
					open-handed,<br />
					gladly giving,<br />
					yoke-mate to asking,<br />
					he is a cheerful giver.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in charity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is achievement in wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman is wise;<br />
					he is wise as to the way of growth and decay,<br />
					possessing Ariyan penetration of the way<br />
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, brāhman are the four conditions,<br />
					which lead to a clansman's advantage and happiness in the world to come.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Up and alert about his task and toil,<br />
							A careful man, he minds his wealth and lives<br />
							The even life; and he is virtuous,<br />
							Believing, kind and bountiful; he clears<br />
							The onward Way to faring well hereafter.<br />
							Thus for the believing home-seeker eight states<br />
							Have been declared by him whose name is Truth'<br />
							As leading unto happiness both here and then,<br />
							To bliss hereafter and to welfare now.<br />
							This is the standard for a householder,<br />
							For merit grows by generosity.'</p>
