					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Monks, a monk who is endowed with eight qualities<br />
					is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<br />
					he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br />
					perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br />
					seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br />
					accepting the training,<br />
					he trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. He is learned,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					<i>is replete with learning,<br />
					is a hoard of learning.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Those doctrines which,<br />
					lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the end<br />
					both in the meaning and the letter of them,<br />
					which preach the utterly fulfilled,<br />
					the perfectly purified way of the God-life, -<br />
					such doctrines are much heard by him,<br />
					borne in mind,<br />
					repeated aloud,<br />
					pondered over<br />
					and well penetrated by his vision;</i></p>

					<p class="f4">5. He has good friends,<br />
					companions and intimates;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. He holds right views and is endowed with wisdom;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. He attains at will,<br />
					easily and without difficulty to those pleasant states of living, even in this life, the four musings wholly mental;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. He remembers divers past dwellings, that is to say: one birth, two births, or three, or four, or five,<br />
					or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty,<br />
					or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand,<br />
					or many an age of rolling on,<br />
					or many an age of rolling back,<br />
					or many an age of both rolling on and rolling back -<br />
					such an one I was by name,<br />
					of such a clan,<br />
					of such a caste,<br />
					such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br />
					such was the end of my life,</p>

					<p class="f4">passing away thence,<br />
					I arose in such a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">there, such was my name,<br />
					such my clan,<br />
					such my caste,<br />
					such my food,<br />
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br />
					such my end,</p>

					<p class="f4">passing away from there,<br />
					I arose here.</p>

					<p class="f4">thus many a previous dwelling<br />
					he calls to mind<br />
					with its circumstances and details;</p>

					<p class="f4">9. He knows by the deva eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of mankind,<br />
					the course of beings -<br />
					lowly and exalted,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					happy and in woe,<br />
					according to their deeds;</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These worthies were given over to evil practices<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					were revilers of the Ariyans,<br />
					holders of wrong views,<br />
					men who have acquired this karma<br />
					from wrong views;<br />
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					have arisen in the untoward way,<br />
					the ill way,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these good sirs behaved rightly<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					were no revilers of the Ariyans,<br />
					held right views<br />
					and have acquired this karma therefrom;<br />
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					have arisen in the blissful heaven world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-eye<br />
					purified and surpassing the human eye,<br />
					he sees and knows beings<br />
					in course of faring on -<br />
					beings lowly and exalted,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					happy and in woe,<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. By destroying the cankers,<br />
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br />
					which is cankerless,<br />
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br />
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk who is endowed with these eight qualities<br />
					is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>
