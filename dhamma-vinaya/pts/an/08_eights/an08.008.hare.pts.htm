<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya, Eights, Sutta 8. Venerable Uttara is teaching the bhikkhus that it is well from time to time to review one's own faults and from time to time to review the faults of others. This is overheard by Vesavana who reports the fact to Sakka, King of the Gods. Sakka visits Uttara and asks him if the saying was original with him and Uttara replies that whatsoever is well said is heard from the Buddha. Sakka then repeats to him the entire episode of it's original utterance by Gotama in AN 8.7. and commends him to remember it as an integral factor in the holy life." />

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable Uttara<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> dwelt near Mahisavatthu,<br />
					on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br />
					in Dhavajalika.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the venerable Uttara addressed the monks. saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, well it is for a monk to review,<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					his own faults;<br />
					well it is for him to review<br />
					the faults of another;<br />
					well it is to review his own attainments;<br />
					well it is to review another's.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Royal deva, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/kuvera.htm">Vessavana,</a><br />
					was on his way from the northern region to the south,<br />
					on some business <a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> or other,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he heard the venerable Uttara teaching the monks in Dhavajalika:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, well it is for a monk to review,<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					his own faults;<br />
					well it is for him to review<br />
					the faults of another;<br />
					well it is to review his own attainments;<br />
					well it is to review another's.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then just as a strong man might stretch forth his bended arm<br />
					or might bend his outstretched arm;<br />
					even so the Royal deva, Vessavana,<br />
					disappeared from Dhavajalika<br />
					and appeared among the devas of the Thirty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Vessavana approached Sakka, king of the devas, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> grace, I would have you know<br />
					that this venerable Uttara in Dhavajalika,<br />
					on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br />
					near Mahisavatthu,<br />
					teaches this doctrine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well it is, from time to time,<br />
					to review one's own faults;<br />
					well it is to review another's;<br />
					well it is to review one's own attainments;<br />
					well it is to review another's."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as a strong man might bend<br />
					and stretch out his arm again,<br />
					Sakka, king of the devas, disappeared from among the devas of the Thirty<br />
					and appeared before the venerable Uttara in Dhavajalika,<br />
					on the Sankheyyaka mountain,<br />
					near Mahisavatthu.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Sakka did not 'sit' he stood. <i>aṭṭhāsi.</i> The Devas, we hear, find this world more than a little distasteful, and when they visit, do not 'sit in it'.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">And Sakka, the deva-king,<br />
					approached the venerable Uttara<br />
					and saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, sir,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> as they say,<br />
					that the venerable Uttara teaches this doctrine to the monks,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well it is, from time to time,<br />
					to review one's own faults;<br />
					well it is to review another's;<br />
					well it is to review one's own attainments;<br />
					well it is to review another's."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, certainly, Deva-king.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But pray, sir,<br />
					is this the venerable Uttara's own saying,<br />
					or is it the word of that Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					the fully awakened One?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, O Deva-king,<br />
					I will give you an analogy,<br />
					for it is by analogy<br />
					that men of intelligence<br />
					understand the meaning of what is said.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine, O King, a great heap of grain<br />
					near some village or market-town,<br />
					from which country folk carry away<br />
					corn on pingoes or in baskets,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in lap or hand.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And if one should <a id="pg112"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></a> approach the folk<br />
					and question them saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whence bring you this corn?"</p>

					<p class="f4">how would those folk,<br />
					in explaining,<br />
					best explain?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They would best explain the matter, sir,<br />
					by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We bring it from that great heap of grain."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, O King,<br />
					<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>whatsoever be well spoken,<br />
					all that is the word of the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					the fully awakened One,<br />
					wholly based<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> thereon<br />
					is both what we and others say.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is marvellous,<br />
					it is wonderful, sir,<br />
					how truly this has been said by the venerable Uttara:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever be well spoken,<br />
					all that is the word of the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					the fully awakened One,<br />
					wholly based thereon<br />
					is what we and others say"!</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>Once, worthy Uttara not long after the departure of Devadatta,<br />
					the Exalted One was dwelling on Vulture's Peak,<br />
					near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One spoke thus to the monks concerning Devadatta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, well it is for a monk to review,<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					his own faults;<br />
					well it is for a monk to review,<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					another's faults;<br />
					well it is for a monk to review,<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					his own attainments;<br />
					well it is for a monk to review,<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					another's attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, mastered by eight wrong states,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">By what eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by gain,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by loss,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by fame,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by obscurity,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by honour,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by lack of honour,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by evil intentions,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by evil friendship,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mastered by these eight,<br />
					Devadatta, with his mind out of control,<br />
					became one doomed to suffer in hell,<br />
					in perdition,<br />
					dwelling there a kalpa,<br />
					irreprievable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, well it is that a monk should live mastering gain,<br />
					loss,<br />
					fame,<br />
					obscurity,<br />
					honour,<br />
					lack of honour,<br />
					evil intentions<br />
					and evil friendship,<br />
					which arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why, and for what good purpose should a monk live mastering gain,<br />
					loss,<br />
					fame,<br />
					obscurity,<br />
					honour,<br />
					lack of honour,<br />
					evil intentions<br />
					and evil friendship,<br />
					which arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when a monk lives with gain,<br />
					loss,<br />
					fame,<br />
					obscurity,<br />
					honour,<br />
					lack of honour,<br />
					evil intentions<br />
					and evil friendship,<br />
					which arise, unmastered,<br />
					there arise the cankers,<br />
					full of distress and anguish;<br />
					but when those states are mastered,<br />
					those cankers,<br />
					full of distress and anguish,<br />
					are not.</p>

					<p class="f4">For this good purpose, monks,<br />
					a monk should master gain,<br />
					loss,<br />
					fame,<br />
					obscurity,<br />
					honour,<br />
					lack of honour,<br />
					evil intentions<br />
					and evil friendship,<br />
					which arise<br />
					and so abide.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will live mastering gain,<br />
					loss,<br />
					fame,<br />
					obscurity,<br />
					honour,<br />
					lack of honour,<br />
					evil intentions<br />
					and evil friendship,<br />
					which arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, monks!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Worthy<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> Uttara, this is a Dhamma discourse nowhere honoured<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					among the four companies, to wit:<br />

					<p class="f4">Sir, let the venerable Uttara learn by heart this Dhamma discourse;<br />
					let him master this Dhamma discourse;<br />
