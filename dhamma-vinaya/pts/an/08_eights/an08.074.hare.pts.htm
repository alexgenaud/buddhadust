					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nādika.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," they replied;<br />

					<p class="f4">2. "Mindfulness of death, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a monk, who,<br />

					<p class="f4">I might stumble and fall;<br />

					<p class="f4">If, monks, on consideration<br />
