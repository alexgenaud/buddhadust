					abstains from taking what is not given him;<br />
					abstains from lustful and evil indulgences;<br />
					abstains from lying;<br />
					and abstains from spirituous intoxicants,<br />
					the cause of indolence<br />

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how does a lay-disciple<br />

					but strives not to compass virtue in another;<br />
