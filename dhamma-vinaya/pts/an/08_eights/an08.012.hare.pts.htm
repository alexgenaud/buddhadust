					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>Once the Exalted One was dwelling in the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana, near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a great many Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br />

					in praise of Dhamma,<br />
					in praise of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/siha.htm">Sīha</a>, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> was seated in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely that Exalted One must be arahant,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus indeed these many notable Licchavis,<br />

					in many a figure praise the Buddha,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now suppose I were to go and see him,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then Sīha approached the Nigaṇṭha, Nāṭaputa and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a third occasion occasion the Licchavi notables were seated assembled in the Mote Hall;<br />

					<p class="f4">And Sīha, the general, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was seated in that assembly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Sīha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Undoubtedly that Exalted One is arahant,<br />
					fully awakened,<br />
					and so these Licchavis assembled and seated in their Mote Hall,<br />
					in many a figure praise the Buddha,<br />
					praise Dhamma,<br />

					<p class="f4">What can the Nigaṇṭhas do to me,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> whether they are consulted or not?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So at noon, Sīha set out from Vesālī<br />

					<p class="f4">Approaching the Exalted One, he saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>
