					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying in <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#alavi">Ālavī</a>, at Aggāḷava<br />
					near the shrine there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hold it true, monks,<br />
					that <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/hatthako_alavako.htm">Hatthaka of Ālavi</a> is endowed with seven marvellous and wonderful qualities!</p>

					<p class="f4">With what seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Hatthaka of Āḷavī has faith,<br />
					is virtuous,<br />
					is conscientious,<br />
					fears blame,<br />
					is a great listener,<br />
					is charitable and wise.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Hold it true, monks, that Hatthaka is so endowed."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One,<br />
					and arising from his seat<br />
					the Well-farer entered the dwelling.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk,<br />
					robing himself early in the morning,<br />
					taking bowl and cloak,<br />
					went to the house of Hatthaka of Āḷavī,<br />
					and there sat down on a seat made ready for him,<br />
					And Hatthaka of Āḷavī approached that monk,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said that monk to Hatthaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It has been declared by the Exalted One<br />
					that you, O householder,<br />
					are possessed of seven marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Hatthaka of Āḷavī has faith,<br />
					is virtuous,<br />
					is conscientious,<br />
					fears blame,<br />
					is a great listener,<br />
					is charitable and wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These, friend, are the seven marvelous and wonderful qualities declared by the Exalted One<br />
					that you are possessed."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I trust, sir, there were no white-robed laymen present."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, indeed, friend,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> there were none such there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is well, sir that there were no white-robed laymen present."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk,<br />
					after taking alms at Hatthaka's house,<br />
					rose from his seat and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when he had eaten his meal,<br />
					after his alms-round,<br />
					he went to the Exalted One<br />
					and saluting him,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here then, sir,<br />
					robing myself early in the morning,<br />
					taking bowl and cloak,<br />
					I went to the house of Hatthaka of Āḷavī,<br />
					and there sat down on a seat made ready,<br />
					and Hatthaka of Āḷavī,<br />
					saluted and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I said to Hatthaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It has been declared by the Exalted One<br />
					that you, O householder,<br />
					are possessed of seven marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">What seven?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hatthaka of Āḷavī has faith,<br />

					is charitable and wise."</p>

					<p class="f4">These, friend, are the seven marvelous and wonderful qualities declared by the Exalted One<br />
					that you are possessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And Hatthaka said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I trust, sir, there were no white-robed laymen present.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, indeed, friend, there were none such there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is well, sir that there were no white-robed laymen present.'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">The clansman is modest.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He does not wish his good qualities known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hold, monk, that Hatthaka of Āḷavī is endowed with this eighth marvellous and wonderful quality,<br />
					namely, modesty."</p>
