					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk possessed of eight qualities<br />

					nor honoured,<br />
					by his fellows in the godly life,<br />

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk praises those who are not dear;<br />
					he blames those who are dear;<br />
					he longs for possessions;<br />
					he longs for honour;<br />

					he has evil intentions;<br />
