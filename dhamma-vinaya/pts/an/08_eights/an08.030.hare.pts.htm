					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha</a> was dwelling <a id="pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#ceti">Cetis</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					as easily as a strong man might stretch forth and bend back his arm,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One sat down on the seat which was made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Anuruddha saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
