					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'Monks, I will define eight excitable<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> horses<br />

					<p class="f4">Listen well,<br />

					I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Monks, what are the eight excitable horses<br />
					and their eight vices?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br />
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br />
					he backs<br />

					with his hind-quarters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br />
					and this is his first vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br />
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br />
					he jumps back,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br />

					<p class="f4">7. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br />
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br />
					he tosses high his breast and paws (the air).</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br />
					and this is his fifth vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable horse<br />

					<p class="f4">9. Again monks, when an excitable horse is told to go on,<br />

					<p class="f4">"I don't remember! I don't remember!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an excitable horse,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br />

					<p class="f4">12. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />

					blurts out at his reprover:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What right have you to talk,<br />
					an ignorant fool?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do you think you must speak?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">13. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />
					and he, being thus reproved, retorts:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, <i>you</i> too committed such and such an offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">You had best make amends first!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />

					<p class="f4">14. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />

					evades the question by another,<br />
					turns the issue aside and shows temper,<br />
					ill-will<br />
					and sulkiness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br />
					and this is his fourth vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />
					and he, being thus reproved,<br />
					speaks when the Order is in conclave,<br />
					with much gesticulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />
					when beaten and urged by his driver,<br />
					tosses high his breast and paws the air;<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">16. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />
					and he, being thus reproved,<br />
					pays no attention to the Order,<br />
					nor heeds his reprover,<br />
					but wanders about at random,<br />
					like an offender.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />
					when beaten and urged by his driver,<br />

					and the goad<br />
					and champs his bit with his teeth<br />
					and wanders at random;<br />
					like that, I say, is this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br />
					and this is his sixth vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">17. Or, monks, the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />
					and he, being thus reproved, says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But <i>I've</i> not committed an offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, <i>I've</i> not offended."</p>

					<p class="f4">And he vexes the Order by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />
					when beaten and urged by his driver,<br />
					goes neither on nor back<br />
					but just halts and stands like a post;<br />
					like that, I say, is this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man<br />
					and this is his seventh vice.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">18. Moreover, monks, when the monks reprove one of themselves for some offence,<br />
					he, being thus reproved by them, says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sirs, why worry<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> so much about me?</p>

					<p class="f4">From now on I will disavow the training and return to the lower life."</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he has returned to the lower life, be says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, reverend sirs, be satisfied!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as an excitable horse,<br />
					when told to go on,<br />
					being beaten and urged by the driver,<br />
					draws his fore and hind legs together<br />
					and sits down;<br />
					like that, I say, is this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, indeed, herein is an excitable man,<br />
					and this is his eighth vice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the eight excitable men and these are their eight vices.'</p>
