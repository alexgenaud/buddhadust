					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					in Eastern Park<br />
					at the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Endowed with four qualities, Monks,<br />
					womenfolk win power in this world;<br />
					this world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p class="f4">With what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Monks, a woman is capable at her work;<br />
					she manages the servants;<br />
					in her ways she is lovely to her lord;<br />
					she guards his wealth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Monks, is a woman capable at her work?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br />
					whether in wool or cotton,<br />
					therein she is deft and nimble;<br />
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br />
					into all such undertakings,<br />
					she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a woman is capable at her work.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does she manage the servants?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband's household consists of -<br />
					slaves,<br />
					messengers<br />
					or workfolk -<br />
					she knows the work of each<br />
					by what has been done;<br />
					she knows their remissness<br />
					by what has not been done;<br />
					she knows the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br />
					she divides the hard and soft food,<br />
					each according to his share.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way she manages the servants.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she lovely in her ways to her lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">What her lord reckons to be unlovely,<br />
					that she would not commit<br />
					for very life's sake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus she is lovely in her ways to her lord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does she guard his wealth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever money, corn, silver or gold<br />
					her husband brings home,<br />
					she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br />
					and of it she is no robber, thief, carouser or wastrel.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way she guards his wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities, Monks,<br />
					womenfolk win power in this world,<br />
					this world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with four qualities, Monks,<br />
					womenfolk win power in the next world,<br />
					the next world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p class="f4">With what four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Monks, a woman is accomplished in faith,<br />
					virtue,<br />
					charity<br />
					and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in faith?</p>

					<p class="f4">She has faith and believes in the awakening of the Tathāgata, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of a truth he is the Exalted One, arahant, fully awake, abounding in wisdom and righteousness,<br />
					the well-farer, world-knower,<br />
					incomparable tamer of tamable men,<br />
					teacher,<br />
					the awakened of devas and men,<br />
					the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her faith.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">She abstains from taking life,<br />
					from stealing,<br />
					from the lusts of the flesh,<br />
					from lying<br />
					and from drinking liquor,<br />
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in charity?</p>

					<p class="f4">She dwells at bome with heart purged of the stain of avarice,<br />
					given over to charity,<br />
					open-handed,<br />
					delighting in giving,<br />
					yoke-mate to asking,<br />
					she finds joy in almsgiving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her charity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is she accomplished in wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">She is wise<br />
					and is endowed with wisdom<br />
					into the way of the rise and fall of things,<br />
					with Ariyan penetration of the way<br />
					to the utter destruction of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is her wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities, Monks,<br />
					womenfolk win power in the next world,<br />
					the next world is in their grasp.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Deft, capable, she manages amid<br />
							His folk at work, minding her husband's wealth,<br />
							Sweet in her ways; and she is virtuous,<br />
							Believing, kind and bountiful; she clears<br />
							The onward Way to faring well hereafter.<br />
							They say a woman who is so endowed,<br />
							With these eight states, is virtuous indeed<br />
							And truthful, just. And where these eight unite,<br />
							Blessed sixteenfold, that virtuous devotee<br />
							Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>
