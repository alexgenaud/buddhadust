					<p class="f4">There <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/mahanamo_sakko.htm">Mahānamā,</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Sakyan, came and visited him and,<br />
					after saluting,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, addressing the Exalted One, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Mahānamā, he has found refuge in the Buddha<br />

					<p class="f4">'Lord, how is a lay-disciple virtuous?</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, Mahānamā, a lay-disciple abstains from taking life;<br />
					abstains from taking what is not given him;<br />
					abstains from lustful and evil indulgences;<br />
					abstains from lying;<br />
					and abstains from spirituous intoxicants,<br />
