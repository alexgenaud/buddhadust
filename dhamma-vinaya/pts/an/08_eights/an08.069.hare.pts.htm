							<p>The note reads: <i>"Windisch, <i>'Mara und Buddha,'</i> p. 75, makes this number refer to the number of entrances, and quotes <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/iti/iti.pali.bd.htm#pg15"><i>Itivuttaka,</i> p. 15,</a> in support. The Singhalese version (p. 758) is as above."</i> The passage in the <i>Itivuttaka</i> speaks of rebirth as Sakka 36 times, and of rebirth as a wheel-turning King hundreds of times, but the Pali is not related to this situation, but speaks of 'habitations' (rebirths) <i>'satta vassāni...'</i>. From the context of this sutta Windisch and Hare's translation fits better. What appears to be being spoken of is The Buddha transforming his appearance, etc. in his then current life during hundreds of different visits (not rebirths). The Pali is <i>'anekasataɱ ~parisaɱ upasaŋkamitā'</i> which is literally 'not (just) one hundred ~assemblies approaching (not "rising up in" as in rebirth)'. Bhk. Bodhi goes the other way and has this as the number of those assembled. The issue here is: Did the Buddha make a practice of going round to various assemblies (say, even around the world) to implant Dhamma without attracting attention to the extra-normal manner in which it was done. The visits covered the full spectrum of assemblies which would indicate that this was a deliberate course of action. If he did this in the virtical direction (up and down the scale of realms), why not in the horizontal? ... hundreds of assemblies.] </p>
