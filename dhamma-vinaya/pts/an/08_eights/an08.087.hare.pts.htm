I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to turn down the bowl in respect of an Upâsaka who is characterised by these eight things.'<br />
							and also:<br />
							When a Bhikkhu behaves towards the laity in any one of the first five of these eight ways the Patisâraniya-kamma is to be carried out against him--that is to say, he has to ask pardon of the layman against whom he has offended.</p>
