<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Eights, Sutta 70. The Buddha states that he is able to extend his lifespan to the end of the evolution of the world. He states this three times but Ānanda does not take the hint to ask him to do so. Mara rejoyces but overplays his hand, pushing for the Buddha to enter PariNibbāna immediately. The Buddha tells Mara not to be impatient for he will do so within three months thereby renouncing the remainder of his lifespan possible. At this statement there is a world-shaking earthquake. Then Ānanda asks about the causes of such earthquakes and Gotama explains the eight causes." />

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the second cause,<br />
					the second reason,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, Ānanda, when a being awakening quits the Tusita assembly<br />
					and enters, mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					his mother's womb;<br />
					then this earth shakes,<br />
					trembles and quakes.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the third cause,<br />

					of a great earthquake becoming manifest.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a being awakening,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the fourth cause,<br />
					the fourth reason,<br />
					of a great earthquake becoming manifest.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a Tathāgata completely awakens<br />
					to the unsurpassed and highest awakening;<br />
					then this earth shakes,<br />
					trembles and quakes.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is the fifth cause,<br />
					the fifth reason,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When a Tathāgata sets rolling the unsurpassed wheel of Dhamma;<br />
