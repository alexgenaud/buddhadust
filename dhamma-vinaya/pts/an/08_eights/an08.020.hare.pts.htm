					<p class="f4">Then thought the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">MahāMogallāna</a>:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Mahā Moggallāna saw a person,<br />

					no recluse though vowed thereto,<br />
					unchaste though vowed to chastity,<br />
					rotten to the core,<br />
					lustful<br />

					and rising from his seat,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Get up, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One has seen you.</p>

					<p class="f4">For you there is no fellowship with the monks.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But when he had thus spoken,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time he addressed him <span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">But when he had thus spoken,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time he addressed him and said:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At that the venerable Mahā Moggallāna seized the man by the arm<br />
					and thrust him outside the porch<br />
					and bolted the door.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna went to the Exalted One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, that person has been expelled by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The assembly is pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, let the Exalted One recite the Obligations.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is very strange, Moggallāna,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then spake the Exalted One to the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now may you recite the Obligations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Henceforth from today,<br />

							No rains rain hard on open things;<br />
							So open ye the covered thing,<br />
							Then no hard rain will rain on that!</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The <i>Ud.</i> commentator observes that the covered thing is the hidden fault. At <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p222"><i>Th.</i> i, 447</a> this verse recurs and is there ascribed to the elder Sirimaṇḍa; <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p225">Brethr. 225.</a></p>

The whole has been restored here.</p>
