					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling among the Koḷiyans,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at their market-town called Kakkarapatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Longknee, the Koḷiyan clansman, visited the Exalted One and,<br />
					after greeting him,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, we householders are immersed in the round of pleasure;<br />
					we are cumbered with bed-mate and sons;<br />
					we delight in the muslins from Benares<br />
					and in sandalwood;<br />
					we deck ourselves with flowers,<br />
					with garlands and cosmetics;<br />
					we enjoy the use of both silver and gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, to such as us,<br />

					and for our happiness here on earth,<br />
					for our advantage and happiness<br />
					in the world to come!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, Tigerfoot,<br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg188"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></a> Achievement in alertness,<br />
					achievement in wariness,<br />
					good company<br />
					and the even life.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tigerfoot, is achievement in alertness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, by whatsoever activity a clansman make his living,<br />
					whether by the plough,<br />
					by trading<br />
					or by cattle-herding,<br />
					by archery<br />
					or as a rajah's man,<br />
					or by any of the crafts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					he is deft and tireless;<br />
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br />
					into ways and means,<br />
					he is able to arrange and carry out his job.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in alertness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tigerfoot, is achievement in wariness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, whatsoever wealth a clansman get together by work and zeal,<br />
					collect by the strength of his arm,<br />
					earn by the sweat of his brow<br />
					and justly obtain in a lawful manner<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					such he husbands by watch and ward, thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now how can I arrange<br />
					so that rajahs may not get this wealth out of me,<br />
					nor thieves filch it,<br />
					nor fire consume it,<br />
					nor water carry it off,<br />
					nor ill-disposed heirs make off with it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called achievement in wariness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tigerfoot, is good company?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, in whatsoever village or market-town a clansman dwell,<br />
					he consorts,<br />
					converses,<br />
					engages in talk<br />
					with householders<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> or householders' sons,<br />
					young men reared in virtue,<br />
					old men old in virtue,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					full of faith,<br />
					virtue,<br />
					charity<br />
					and wisdom.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He emulates the fullness of faith<br />
					in such as are full of faith;<br />

					in such as are full of virtue;<br />
					he emulates the fullness of charity<br />

					he emulates the fullness of wisdom<br />
					in such as are full of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called good company.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Tigerfoot, is the even life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a clansman<br />
					while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br />
					continues his <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> business serenely,<br />
					not unduly elated or depressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus my income,<br />
					after deducting the loss,<br />
					will stand (at so much)<br />
					and my outgoings will not exceed my income."</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>Just as one who carries scales,<br />
					or his apprentice,<br />
					knows, on holding up the balance,<br />
					that either by so much it has dipped down<br />
					or by so much it has tilted up;<br />
					even so, Tigerfoot,<br />
					a clansman experiencing both gain and loss<br />
					continues his business serenely,<br />
					neither unduly elated<br />
					nor unduly depressed,<br />
					but realizes that<br />
					after allowing for the loss<br />
					his income will stand at so much<br />
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Tigerfoot, this clansman have but small earnings<br />
					and live on a grand scale,<br />
					it will be rumoured of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This clansman eats his wealth<br />
					like a fig-tree glutton."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And if his earnings be great<br />
					and he live meanly,<br />
					rumour will say of him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This clansman will die like a starveling.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore this clansman while experiencing both gain and loss in wealth,<br />
					continues his business serenely,<br />
					not unduly elated or depressed,<br />
					but realizes that<br />
					after allowing for the loss<br />
					his income will stand at so much<br />
					and that his outgoings will not exceed his income.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
