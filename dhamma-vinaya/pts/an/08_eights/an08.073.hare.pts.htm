					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nādika.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord," they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Mindfulness of death, monks,<br />
					when made become,<br />
					developed<br />
					is very fruitful,<br />
					of great advantage,<br />
					merging and ending in the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, do ye make become<br />
					mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And when he had thus spoken,<br />
					a certain monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely were I to live but one day and night,<br />
					an I were to ponder over the word of the Exalted One,<br />
					much indeed would be done by me' - </p>

					<p class="f4">thus, lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And another monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And another monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And another monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely were I to live long enough to eat one alms-meal,<br />
					an I were to ponder over the word of the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">8. And another monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely were I to live long enough to swallow four or five morsels of food,<br />
					which I have munched,<br />
					an I were to ponder over the word of the Exalted One,<br />
					much indeed would be done by me' - </p>

					<p class="f4">thus, lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">9. And another monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">10. And another monk said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I make become mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How, monk, do you make it become?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, lord, such is my thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely were I to live but long enough to breathe in after breathing out,<br />

					<p class="f4">thus, lord, I make become mindfulness of death." </p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken, the Exalted One said to those monks: </p>

					<p class="f4">"This monk who makes become mindfulness of death thus: </p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, train yourselves thus: </p>
