<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Eights, Sutta 82. Punniya, asks why it is that sometimes the Buddha will teach and sometimes not. Gotama explains that there are eight factors involved, but that more than the simple eight factors what is needed is to see progress up the eight factors in a bhikkhu. So sometimes a teaching may be given with only some of the factors and other times not when even one is missing." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> We should possibly read: <i>'Yato ca kho, P., imehi dhammehi samannāgato bhikkhu hoti';</i> but the <i>S.e.</i> is the same as our text, and includes <i>aṭṭhahi</i> with most <i>MSS.</i> The <i>Comy.</i> seems to agree with the text, observing:	<i>Samannāgato-ti, sāmīatthe paccattaɱ, samannāgatassāti vuttaɱ hoti.</i></p>
