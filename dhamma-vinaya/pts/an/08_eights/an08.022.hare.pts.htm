					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#hatthigama">Hatthigāma</a> among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vajjians">Vajjīans</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">'Hold it true, monks,<br />
					that <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/uggato_gahapati.htm">Ugga,</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the householder of Hatthigāma,<br />
					is possessed of eight marvellous and wonderful qualities.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Well-farer had thus spoken,<br />
					rising from his seat,<br />
					he entered his dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> Now a certain monk,<br />
					robing himself early in the morning,<br />
					taking bowl and cloak,<br />
					went to the house of Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma,<br />
					and there sat down on a seat made ready for him,<br />
					and Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma approached that monk,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said that monk to Ugga:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It has been declared by the Exalted One<br />
					that you, O householder,<br />
					are possessed of eight marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are those eight marvelous and wonderful qualities, householder,<br />
					of which you are declared by the Exalted One to be possessed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, reverend sir,<br />
					I know not of what eight marvelous and wonderful qualities<br />
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed;<br />
					but as to the eight marvelous and wonderful qualities found in me,<br />
					listen, lend and ear and I will tell you.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, householder,'<br />
					replied the monk;<br />
					and Ugga said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, sir, I was sporting in Nāga glade,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I saw the Exalted One a good way off,<br />
					and at the sight of him,<br />
					my mind became tranquil<br />
					and my drunkenness vanished.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first marvellous and wonderful quality quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with tranquil heart<br />
					I drew nigh and reverenced the Exalted One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And to me he preached a graduated discourse,<br />
					that is to say:<br />
					on almsgiving,<br />
					on virtue<br />
					and on heaven.<br />
					He set forth the peril,<br />
					the folly,<br />
					the depravity of lusts<br />
					and the advantages of renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Exalted One knew<br />
					that my heart was clear, malleable,<br />
					free from hindrance,<br />
					uplifted,<br />
					lucid,<br />
					then he revealed to me<br />
					that Dhamma-teaching<br />
					to which Buddhas alone have won,<br />
					to wit:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ill,<br />
					its coming-to-be,<br />
					its ending<br />
					and the Way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a clean cloth,<br />
					free of all stain,<br />
					will take dye perfectly;<br />
					even so, as I sat there,<br />
					there arose within me<br />
					the spotless, stainless Dhamma-sight:<br />
					that whatsoever is conditioned by coming-to-be,<br />
					all that is subject to ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, sir, saw Dhamma,<br />
					possessed Dhamma,<br />
					found Dhamma,<br />
					penetrated Dhamma,<br />
					overcame doubt,<br />
					surpassed uncertainty,<br />
					possessed without another's aid<br />
					perfect confidence in the word of the Teacher,<br />
					and there and then took refuge<br />
					in the Buddha, in Dhamma and in the Order,<br />
					and embraced the five rules of training<br />
					in the godly life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second<br />
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, sir, I had four wives,<br />
					young girls,<br />
					and I went and spoke to them thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sisters, I have embraced the five rules of training in the godly life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who wishes, may enjoy the wealth of this place,<br />
					or may do deeds of merit,<br />
					or may go to her own relations and family;<br />
					or is there some man you desire<br />
					to whom I may give you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I stopped speaking,<br />
					the eldest wife said to me:|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sir, give me to such and such a man!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I had that man sent for;<br />
					and, taking my wife by the left hand<br />
					and holding the water pot in my right,<br />
					that man (by an act of dedication).<br />
					Yet I was not a whit discomfited<br />
					at parting with my wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third<br />
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, there is wealth in my family,<br />
					but among the good and lovely in character<br />
					it is shared impartially.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth<br />
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I wait upon a monk, sir,<br />
					I serve him respectfully<br />
					and not without deference.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth<br />
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">It is, sir, nothing wonderful for devas to come and tell me,<br />
					when I have invited the Order,<br />
					that such an one is freed-both-ways;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that he is wisdom-freed;<br />
					that he is a seer-in-body;<br />
					that he is a view-winner;<br />
					that he is faith-freed;<br />
					that he is a Dhamma-follower;<br />
					that he is a faith-follower;<br />
					that he is virtuous and lovely in character;<br />
					or that such an one is wicked and evil in character.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, sir, while I wait on the Order,<br />
					I wot of no such thoughts,<br />
					suggesting:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"To him I will give little."</p>

					<p class="f4">"To him I will give much."</p>

					<p class="f4">Rather, sir, I give impartially.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth quality<br />
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, sir,<br />
					it is not uncommon for devas to come<br />
					and declare to me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Perfectly, O householder,<br />
					is Dhamma proclaimed by the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">When they speak thus, I reply:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Ho! You devas,<br />
					whether you declare so or not,<br />
					Dhamma is perfectly proclaimed by the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, sir, I feel no elation<br />
					because of such thoughts as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is to me these devas come."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am the man who talks to devas."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh<br />
					marvelous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, if I should die before the Exalted One,<br />
					that would not be very wonderful.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that the Exalted One should declare of me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is no fetter,<br />
					fettered by which,<br />
					Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma,<br />
					shall come again to this world"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					- (that is wonderful).</p>

					<p class="f4">This, sir, is the eighth marvellous and wonderful quality found in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, sir, these are the eight<br />
					marvellous and wonderful quality found in me<br />
					but I know not of what eight<br />
					marvellous and wonderful qualities<br />
					I am declared by the Exalted One to be possessed.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that monk,<br />
					after taking alms at Ugga's house,<br />
					rose from his seat and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when he had eaten his meal,<br />
					after his alms-round,<br />
					he went to the Exalted One<br />
					and saluting him,<br />
					sat down at one side.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he told the Exalted One<br />
					of all his conversation<br />
					with Ugga the householder of Hatthigāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well done, well done, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">As Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma,<br />
					in explaining the matter rightly<br />
					should explain;<br />
					even so, monk,<br />
					he is declared by me<br />
					to be possessed of those eight<br />
					marvelous and wonderful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monk,<br />
					hold it true<br />
					that Ugga, the householder of Hatthigāma, is so possessed!"</p>
