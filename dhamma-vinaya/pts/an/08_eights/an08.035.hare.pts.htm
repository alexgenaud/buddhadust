							<p>'Cannot by gifts alone'. Nowhere in this sutta does the Buddha indicate that any aspiation will prosper by gifts alone! There is an entire network of factors that go into even the first case. What the commentator is really doing is pushing the commentarial idea that it is by the first jhāna alone that one gets into the Brahma realms, and this too is not being said. This tells you that the commentators are willing to contradict the word of the Buddha to make their points.</p>
