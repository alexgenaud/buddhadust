					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Monks, a monk who is endowed with eight qualities<br />
					is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p><a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Herein a monk is virtuous,<br />
					he abides restrained by the restraint of the obligations,<br />
					perfect in behaviour and conduct,<br />
					seeing danger in the smallest fault,<br />
					accepting the training,<br />
					he trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. He is learned,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					<i>is replete with learning,<br />
					is a hoard of learning.</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Those doctrines which,<br />
					lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely at the end<br />
					both in the meaning and the letter of them,<br />
					which preach the utterly fulfilled,<br />
					the perfectly purified way of the God-life, -<br />
					such doctrines are much heard by him,<br />
					borne in mind,<br />
					repeated aloud,<br />
					pondered over<br />
					and well penetrated by his vision;</i></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. He dwells strenuous,<br />
					steadfast,<br />
					energetic,<br />
					shirking not the burden of righteousness;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. He is a forest-dweller,<br />
					having his bed and seat apart from mankind;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">7. <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>He endures likes and dislikes,<br />
					dwelling in continuous mastery<br />
					of dislikes which arise;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. He endures fear and dismay,<br />
					dwelling in continuous mastery<br />
					of fear and dismay which arise;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">9. He attains at will,<br />
					easily and without difficulty<br />
					to those pleasant states of living,<br />
					even in this life,<br />
					the four musings wholly mental;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">10. By destroying the cankers,<br />
					he enters and abides in<br />
					the emancipation of the heart and wisdom,<br />
					which is cankerless,<br />
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br />
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, a monk who is endowed with these eight qualities<br />
					is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit.'</p>
