					<p class="f4">I called to mind divers former dwellings,<br />
					that is to say:<br />
					one birth, or two, or three, or four, or five,<br />
					or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty,<br />
					or a hundred, or a thousand, or a hundred thousand,<br />
					or many an age of rolling on,<br />
					or many an age of rolling back,<br />
					or many an age of both rolling on and rolling back -<br />
					such an one I was by name,<br />
					of such a clan,<br />
					of such a caste,<br />
					such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of weal and woe,<br />
					such was the end of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away thence,<br />

					<p class="f4">With the deva-eye,<br />

					beings lowly and exalted,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					happy and in woe,<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These worthies were given over to evil practices<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					were revilers of the Ariyans,<br />
					holders of wrong views,<br />
					men who have acquired this karma<br />
					from wrong views;<br />
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					have arisen in the untoward way,<br />
					the ill way,<br />
					the abyss,<br />
					hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these good sirs behaved rightly<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					were no revilers of the Ariyans,<br />
					held right views<br />
					and have acquired this karma therefrom;<br />
					and on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					have arisen in the blissful heaven world."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-eye<br />
					purified and surpassing the human eye,<br />

					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					happy and in woe,<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahman, was the second knowledge attained by me<br />

					I knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is destroyed;<br />
					lived is the godly life;<br />
					done is what must be done;<br />

					<p class="f4">"This, brahman, was the third knowledge attained by me<br />
