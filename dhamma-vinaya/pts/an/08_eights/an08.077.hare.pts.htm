<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Eights, Sutta 77. The Buddha deliniates the difference in attitude of eight sorts of persons who still wish for possessions, pointing out that it is the reaction with sorrow or joy to failure or success in their wishes that indicates that one has fallen from the path and the non-reaction with sorrow or joy that indicates that the other is still on the path." />
