					<p class="f4">Eight qualities have women, Anuruddha,<br />

					are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

					<p class="f4">What eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Anuruddha, the husband to whom her parents give her,<br />
					out of love for her,<br />
					seeking her good,<br />
					in loving kindness<br />
					<a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a> and fond regard, -<br />

					retire after him,<br />
					be obedient to his wishes,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whosoever is honoured by her husband as mother,<br />
					father,<br />
					recluse<br />
					or godly man,<br />
					such she reverences,<br />
					honours,<br />
					esteems<br />
					and respects;<br />
					on their arrival she proffers a seat and water.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever her husband's home industries,<br />
					whether in wool or cotton,<br />
					therein she is deft and nimble;<br />
					gifted with an inquiring turn of mind<br />
					into all such undertakings,<br />
					she is able to arrange and carry them out.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of whatever her husband's household consists -<br />
					slaves,<br />
					messengers<br />
					or workfolk -<br />
					she knows the work of each<br />
					by what has been done;<br />
					she knows their remissness<br />

					she divides the hard and soft food,<br />
					each according to his share.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When her husband brings home money,<br />
					corn,<br />
					silver<br />
					or gold,<br />
					she keeps it secure by watch and ward;<br />
					and of it she is no robber,<br />
					thief,<br />
					carouser,<br />
					wastrel.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">She is a lay-disciple,<br />
					who has found refuge in the Buddha,<br />
					in Dhamma<br />
					and in the Order.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">She keeps the precepts,<br />
					abstaining from taking life,<br />
					from stealing,<br />
					from fleshly lusts,<br />
					from lying,<br />
					from drinking strong drink,<br />
					the cause of sloth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">She is charitable,<br />
					dwelling at home with heart purged of the stain of stinginess;<br />
					given over to charity,<br />
					open-handed,<br />
					taking delight in giving,<br />
					yoke-mate to asking,<br />
					she finds joy in almsgiving.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These, Anuruddha, are the eight qualities women have,<br />
					who, after death, are reborn among the fairies of lovely form.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Active, alert to cherish him alway,<br />
							Not to that man who brings her every joy<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
							She offers slight, nor will a good wife move<br />
							To wrath her husband by some spiteful word;<br />
							And she reveres all whom her lord doth honour -<br />
							<a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> For she is wise. Deft, nimble, up betimes,<br />
							She minds his wealth amid his folk at work<br />
							And sweetly orders all. A wife like this,<br />
							Who with her husband's wish and will complies,<br />
							Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>
