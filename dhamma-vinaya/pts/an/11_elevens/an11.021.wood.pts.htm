					<p class="f4">Sitting to one side those monks addressed the venerable Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"May it be, venerable Sāriputta, that a monk's winning of concentration is of such a sort that<br />
					in earth he is unaware of earth,<br />
					in water unaware of water,<br />
					in heat unaware of heat,<br />
					in air unaware of it,<br />
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br />
					in the sphere of infinite intellection unaware of it,<br />
					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br />
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br />
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br />
					in the world beyond unaware of it,<br />
					in whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br />
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br />
					unaware of the seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br />
					attained, searched into, pondered over by mind<br />
					and yet at the same time he may be aware?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be the case, monks,<br />
					that a monk's winning of concentration is of such a sort that<br />
					in earth he is unaware of earth,<br />
					in water unaware of water,<br />
					in heat unaware of heat,<br />
					in air unaware of it,<br />
					in the sphere of unbounded space unaware of it,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, <i>Sāriputta,</i> your reverence, in what way may it be that a monk's winning of concentration<br />
					is of such a sort that<br />
					in earth he is unaware of earth,<br />
					in water unaware of water,<br />
					in heat unaware of heat,<br />
					in air unaware of it,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, monks, a monk is conscious thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is the real,<br />
					this is the best<br />
					— namely, the calming of all activities,<br />
					the rejection of all substrate,<br />
					the ending of craving,<br />
					the fading of interest,<br />
					stopping,<br />
					Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a way a monk's winning of concentration<br />

					in earth he is unaware of earth,<br />

					in heat unaware of heat,<br />
					in air unaware of it,<br />

					in the sphere of nothingness unaware of it,<br />
					in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception unaware of it;<br />
					that in this world he is unaware of this world,<br />
					in the world beyond unaware of it,<br />
					in whatsoever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,<br />
