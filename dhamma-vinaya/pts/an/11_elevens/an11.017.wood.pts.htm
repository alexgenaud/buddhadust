					<p class="f4">At these words Dasama, the housefather of Aṭṭhaka-town<br />
					said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as if, Ānanda, your reverence,<br />
					a man searching for the entrance to a single hidden treasure<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					should at one and the same time<br />
					come upon the entrance to eleven such treasures;<br />
					even so I, your reverence,<br />
					in my search for a single door to the deathless,<br />
					at one and the same time<br />
					have come to win eleven such doors<br />
					whereby to enter in.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt347" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/11_elevens/an11.017.pali.bd.htm#pg347"><span class="f2">[347]</span></a> Just as if, your reverence,<br />
					a man should own a house with eleven doors.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If that house were ablaze,<br />
					he could win safety for himself by any one door;<br />
					even so, your reverence,<br />
					shall I be able to make the self safe<br />
					hy any one of those eleven doors to the deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverence,<br />
					those who hold other views<br />
					will search for a fee for the teacher.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why then should not I do worship<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> So Dasama, the housefather of Aṭṭhaka-town,<br />
					assembled the Order of monks at Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta,<br />
					and with his own hands<br />
					served them with choice food<br />
					both hard and soft<br />
					till they had eaten their fill,<br />
					and clothed each one<br />
					with a separate set of cloth for robes;<br />
					but the venerable Ānanda<br />
					he clothed with three robes complete,<br />
					and in addition<br />
					caused a lodging<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> that cost five hundred pieces to be built.</p>
