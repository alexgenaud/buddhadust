<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Elevens, Sutta 3. The Buddha explains that in the immoral person freedom from regret, joy, entheusiasm, calm, happiness, serenity, knowing and seeing things as they are, disgust with things as they are, and knowing and seeing freedom, for these things lack basis, but in the reverse case has basis. A simile is given." />
