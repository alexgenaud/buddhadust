<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Elevens, Sutta 2. The Buddha explains why when one has established perfect ethical conduct there is no need to make an effort of will to bring forth freedom from regret, joy, entheusiasm, calm, happiness, serenity, knowing and seeing things as they are, disgust with things as they are, and knowing and seeing freedom, for these things arise naturally as a consequence of perfect ethical conduct." />

					concentration has knowing and seeing things as they really are<br />

					happiness has concentration<br />

					calm has happiness;<br />

					good conduct has freedom from remorse<br />

					freedom from remorse as its profit.</p>
