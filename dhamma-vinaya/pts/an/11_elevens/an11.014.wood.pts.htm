					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/11_elevens/an11.014.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans<br />
					at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that <a id="pg214"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></a> occasion<br />
					the Exalted One was desirous<br />
					of taking up residence<br />
					during the rainy season<br />
					at Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br />
					that the Exalted One so desired.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt335" href="../../../pali/an/11_elevens/an11.013.pali.bd.htm#pg335"><span class="f2">[335]</span></a> Then it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose I also were to take up residence<br />
					at Sāvatthī during the rainy season.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I could both apply myself<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to my business<br />
					and at the same time<br />
					get a chance of seeing the Exalted One<br />
					from time to time."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One took up residence at Sāvatthī<br />
					during the rainy season<br />
					and Nandiya the Sakyan did the same.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he applied himself to his business<br />
					and from time to time<br />
					got a chance of seeing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a number of monks were busy<br />
					making robes for the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"For," said they, "when the rains are over<br />
					the Exalted One will go forth on his rounds."</p>

					<p class="f4">And Nandiya the Sakyan heard it said<br />
					that a number of monks were busy<br />
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br />
					and that when the rains were over<br />
					the Exalted One would set forth on his rounds,<br />
					so he went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard it said, sir,<br />
					that a number of monks are busy<br />
					making robes for the Exalted One,<br />
					and that when the rains are over<br />
					the Exalted One will set forth on his rounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, among those who live in various ways,<br />
					in whose way of living should we live?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well asked, Nandiya!<br />
					Well asked, Nandiya!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a fit thing for you clansmen<br />
					to come to see the Wayfarer<br />
					and ask such a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business, Nandiya,<br />
					is a believer, not an unbeliever.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business is virtuous, not immora1.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br />
					is of ardent energy, no sluggard.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br />
					has mindfulness fixed, not distracted.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br />
					is composed, not discomposed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br />
					is strong in insight, not weak in insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have established yourself<br />
					in these six qualities, Nandiya,<br />
					you should set up mindfulness<br />
					in the inner self<br />
					in five<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Nandiya, you should recollect the Wayfarer thus: <a id="pt336" href="../../../pali/an/11_elevens/an11.013.pali.bd.htm#pg336"><span class="f2">[336]</span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One is an arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Welfarer, a world-knower,<br />
					an unsurpassed trainer of men to be trained,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					an awakened one,<br />
					Exalted One is he.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on the Wayfarer<br />
					you should set up mindfulness<br />
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well <a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma<br />
					that is of this visible life,<br />
					unhindered by time,<br />
					that bids one come to see it,<br />
					that leads onward,<br />
					to be understood by the discerning,<br />
					each for himself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on Dhamma<br />
					you should set up mindfulness<br />
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect lovely friends thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A gain to me it is indeed!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well gotten indeed by me it is,<br />
					that I have lovely friends,<br />
					compassionate,||<br />
					desirous of my welfare,<br />
					who encourage and exhort me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on lovely friends<br />
					you should set up mindfulness<br />
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Nandiya, you should recollect your own liberality thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A gain it is to me indeed!<br />
					Well gotten indeed it is by me,<br />
					that amid folk overgrown<br />
					with the blight of stinginess<br />
					I live at home cleansed<br />
					of the blight of stinginess,<br />
					openhanded, pure-handed,<br />
					delighting in self-surrender,<br />
					one to ask a favour of,<br />
					rejoicing in dispensing charitable gifts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, firmly fixed on liberality<br />
					you should set up mindfulness<br />
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Nandiya, you should recollect the devas thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever devas,<br />
					passing beyond the company of those devas<br />
					who subsist on food material,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					do rise up again in a certain mind-made body<br />
					— such devas observe in the self<br />
					nothing more to do,<br />
					no need for repeating what is done.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br />
					a monk who is definitely released<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					observes in the self no more to do,<br />
					observes no need for repeating <a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> what is done,<br />
					even so, Nandiya,<br />
					whatsoever devas,<br />
					passing beyond the company of those devas<br />
					who subsist on food material,<br />
					do rise up again in a certain mind-made body,<br />
					— such devas observe in the self<br />
					nothing more to do,<br />
					no need for repeating what is done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Nandiya, fixed upon the devas<br />
					you should cause mindfulness to arise<br />
					in the inner self.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Nandiya,<br />
					possessing these eleven qualities<br />
					the Ariyan disciple<br />
					just abandons evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					he clings not to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, Nandiya,<br />
					a pot upset<br />
					pours out its water<br />
					and cannot take it in again;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or just as fire<br />
					let loose in a dry grass-jungle<br />
					goes blazing on<br />
					and turns not back to what is burnt out,<br />
					even so, Nandiya,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple<br />
					possessed of these eleven qualities<br />
					just abandons evil, unprofitable states<br />
					and clings not to them."</p>
