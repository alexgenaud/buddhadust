Ānanda asks about the point and the profit, and the Buddha explains that good conduct has freedom from remorse as object and profit; freedom from remorse has joy; joy has rapture; rapture has calm; calm has happiness; happiness has concentration; concentration has seeing things as they really are; seeing things as they really are has revulsion; revulsion has fading interest; and fading of interest has release by knowing and seeing as their object and profit." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Nissāya</i> is the name given to this chapter, from the frequent occurrence of the word in §9. Text wrongly prints <i>nissaya</i> (pupillage), the name of a sutta of the Tens, No. 34.</p>

The root-idea is 'thing-sought,' or '-needed,' and so 'aimed at.' This is well shown in the much-used parable of the man <i>sār-atthiko (-ika=iya),</i> 'seeking (or needing) timber': see below again, p. 201 [here]; also five times in the <i>Majjhima</i> and four times in <i>K.S.</i> The 'forward view' in the contexts makes such a term as 'of what use' not quite so suitable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Sīlāni</i> (good conduct) is more literally habits, then, moral habits. The English words have too wide and deep a range.</p>
