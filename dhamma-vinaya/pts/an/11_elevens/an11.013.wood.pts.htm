					at Kapilavatthu in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion Mahānāma the Sakyan<br />
					had risen from the bed of sickness,<br />
					had not long arisen from sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					a number of monks were busy<br />

					<p class="f4">"For," said they,<br />

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, among those who live in various ways,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well asked, Mahānāma!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well asked, Mahānāma!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a fit thing for you clansmen<br />
					to come to see the Wayfarer<br />
					and ask such a question.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business, Mahānāma,<br />
					is a believer, not an unbeliever.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br />
					is of ardent energy, no sluggard.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He who means business<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have established yourself in these five qualities, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should further make six qualities to grow.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this matter, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect the Wayfarer thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted One is an arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Welfarer, a world-knower,<br />
					an unsurpassed trainer of men to be trained,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					an awakened one,<br />
					Exalted One is he.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple<br />
					thus calls to mind the Wayfarer,<br />
					at that time his heart<br />
					is not obsessed by lust,<br />
					not obsessed by malice,<br />
					not obsessed by delusion;<br />
					at such time his heart<br />
					is firmly fixed on the Wayfarer;<br />
					with upright heart the Ariyan disciple<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of the wea1,<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br />
					wins the joyful thrill<br />
					of joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one so joyous is born zest;<br />
					in one of zestful mind<br />
					the body is calmed;<br />
					he whose body is calmed<br />
					experiences happiness;<br />
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of the awakened one, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should make to grow<br />
					as you go along,<br />
					as you stand,<br />
					as you sit,<br />
					as you lie,<br />
					as you apply yourself to business;<br />
					you should make it to grow<br />
					as you dwell at home in your lodging<br />
					crowded with children.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt334" href="../../../pali/an/11_elevens/an11.012.pali.bd.htm#pg334"><span class="f2">[334]</span></a> Again, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect Dhamma thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma<br />
					that is of this visible life,<br />
					unhindered by time,<br />
					that bids one come to see it,<br />
					that leads onward,<br />
					to be understood by the discerning,<br />
					each for himself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects Dhamma,<br />
					at that time his heart<br />
					is not obsessed by lust, malice, delusion.<br />
					At such time<br />
					his upright heart is fixed on Dhamma;<br />
					upright in heart the Ariyan disciple<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of the weal,<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br />
					wins the joyful thrill<br />
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br />
					in one of zestful mind<br />
					the body is calmed;<br />
					he whose body is calmed<br />
					experiences happiness;<br />
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of the Dhamma, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should make to grow as you go along,<br />
					as you stand,<br />
					as you sit,<br />
					as you lie,<br />
					as you apply yourself to business;<br />
					you should make it to grow<br />
					as you dwell at home in your lodging<br />
					crowded with children.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect the Order thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well-faring on the way<br />
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br />
					straightforward-faring on the way<br />
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br />
					faring on in the Method<br />
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br />
					dutifully faring onward<br />
					is the Order of disciples of the Exalted One, namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">The four pairs of men,<br />
					the eight persons who are males.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the Exalted One's Order of disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of honour,<br />
					worthy of reverence,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of salutations with clasped hands are they,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects the Order,<br />
					at that time<br />
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.<br />
					His heart is upright,<br />
					is firmly fixed on the Order;<br />
					with heart thus upright<br />
					the Ariyan disciple<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of the weal,<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br />
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br />
					in one of zestful mind<br />
					the body is calmed;<br />
					he whose body is calmed<br />
					experiences happiness;<br />
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of the Order, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should make to grow as you go along,<br />
					as you stand,<br />
					as you sit,<br />
					as you lie,<br />
					as you apply yourself to business;<br />
					you should make it to grow<br />
					as you dwell at home in your lodging<br />
					crowded with children.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect your own virtues<br />
					as being unbroken, whole, unspotted,<br />
					untarnished, giving freedom,<br />
					as praised by the discerning ones,<br />
					virtues untainted,<br />
					which lead to concentration of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects his virtues,<br />
					at that time<br />
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.<br />
					At such a time his heart is upright,<br />
					firmly fixed on virtue.<br />
					With heart thus upright<br />
					the Ariyan disciple wins<br />
					the joyful thrill of the weal,<br />
					of Dhamma,<br />
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br />
					in one of zestful mind<br />
					the body is calmed;<br />
					he whose body is calmed experiences happiness;<br />
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of the virtues, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should make to grow as you go along,<br />
					as you stand,<br />
					as you sit,<br />
					as you lie,<br />
					as you apply yourself to business;<br />
					you should make it to grow<br />
					as you dwell at home in your lodging<br />
					crowded with children.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should recollect your own liberality, thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'A gain, indeed, it is to me,<br />
					well gained it is by me<br />
					that, amid folk o'ergrown with the blight of stinginess,<br />
					I live at home<br />
					with heart cleansed<br />
					of the blight of stinginess,<br />
					open-handed, pure-handed,<br />
					delighting in self-surrender,<br />
					one to ask a favour of,<br />
					one who rejoices in dispensing charitable gifts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects liberality,<br />
					at that time<br />
					his heart is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.<br />
					His heart is upright,<br />
					is firmly fixed on liberality;<br />
					with heart thus upright<br />
					the Ariyan disciple wins<br />
					the joyful thrill of the weal,<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of Dhamma,<br />
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br />
					in one of zestful mind<br />
					the body is calmed;<br />
					he whose body is calmed<br />
					experiences happiness;<br />
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of liberality, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should make to grow as you go along,<br />
					as you stand,<br />
					as you sit,<br />
					as you lie,<br />
					as you apply yourself to business;<br />
					you should make it to grow<br />
					as you dwell at home in your lodging<br />
					crowded with children.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Mahānāma, you should recollect the devas, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are the devas of the Four Great Kings,<br />
					those of the suite of the Thirty-three,<br />
					the devas of Yama,<br />
					the devas of delight,<br />
					the devas who delight in creation,<br />
					those who have power over the creations of others,<br />
					the devas of the body of Brahmā,<br />
					the devas beyond that.</p>

					<p class="f4">In me too is seen<br />
					that sort of faith<br />
					blest with which<br />
					those devas deceased hence<br />
					and rose up again there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In me too is seen<br />
					that sort of virtue,<br />
					that sort of learning,<br />
					that sort of liberality,<br />
					that sort of insight,<br />
					blest with which<br />
					those devas deceasd here<br />
					and rose up again there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At such time, Mahānāma,<br />
					as the Ariyan disciple recollects the faith,<br />
					virtue, learning,<br />
					liberality and insight<br />
					both of himself and of those devas,<br />
					at that time his heart<br />
					is not obsessed by lust, malice and delusion.<br />
					At that time<br />
					his heart is upright,<br />
					fixed upon the devas.<br />
					With upright heart<br />
					the Ariyan disciple<br />
					wins the joyful thrill of the weal,<br />
					of Dhamma,<br />
					of the joy that goes with Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one joyous is born zest;<br />
					in one of zestful mind<br />
					the body is calmed;<br />
					he whose body is calmed<br />
					experiences happiness;<br />
					the mind of the happy man is concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This recollection of the devas, Mahānāma,<br />
					you should make to grow as you go along,<br />
					as you stand,<br />
					as you sit,<br />
					as you lie,<br />
					as you apply yourself to business;<br />
					you should make it to grow<br />
					as you dwell at home in your lodging<br />
					crowded with children.</p>
