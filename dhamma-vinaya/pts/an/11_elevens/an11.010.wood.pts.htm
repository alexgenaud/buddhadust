<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Elevens, Sutta 10. Sandha is encouraged not to pracice jhana with worldly objectives. He is then instructed as to how to practice such that his jhana is not dependent on earth, etc. (as in #7) and yet he does have jhana. In this sutta such independent objects if jhana are made 'un-being' (vibhuta) (not existent in the sense of not being identified with the existence of an individual)." />
