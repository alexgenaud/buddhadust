<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 93. Anāthapiṇḍika visits wanderers of other views, listens to their views and shows the wanderers how, in each case, the view is just a grasping after security based on something theoretical, made up, and which will lead to pain. When asked about his own views he responds that it is a not-clinging to things that are graspings after security based on things theoretical, made up, and which will lead to pain." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> left Sāvatthī at an early hour<br />
					to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not time to see the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br />

					those monks are in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br />

					the Wanderers who hold other views?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Anathapiṇḍika drew near<br />
					the Park where dwelt<br />
					the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					the Wanderers holding other views,<br />
					having come together in a great company,<br />
					were sitting engaged in divers childish talk,<br />
					all talking loudly,<br />
					making a great noise and din.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they saw the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika approaching,<br />
					while yet he was at some distance,<br />
					they hushed each other, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					a disciple of Gotama the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">This housefather Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					is one of those disciples of Gotama the recluse,<br />
					householders clad in white,<br />
					who live at Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those worthies are fond of little noise,<br />
					they are schooled to little noise,<br />
					they speak in praise of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if he sees our company making little noise,<br />
					he will think it worth his while to draw near."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, housefather, since you know not all the view<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Tathāgata,</i> as I remarked above, I take this term in this context as applied to any man; the <i>Tathāgata</i> <i>(par excellence)</i> I have translated <i>Wayfarer</i>. This set of views is about the only one put in the mouths of the 'Heretics' by the monks. If they used the word <i>Tathāgata</i> at all, it would not be in the sense used by the Pali records. <i>Comy.</i> generally interprets as 'just a being.' It is unlikely that the Master called himself <i>Tathāgata,</i> certainly not <i>Buddha.</i> 'Is' means 'survives.'</p>
