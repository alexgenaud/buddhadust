					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the raja Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					had just returned from a sham<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> fight,<br />
					having being victorious,<br />
					and attained his object.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the raja turned<br />
					in the direction of the Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far as the cart-road went<br />
					he rode in his chariot,<br />
					and then got down and reached the residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Pasenadi the raja of Kosala went towards those monks,<br />
					and on reaching them thus accosted them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, your reverences,<br />
					where now is the Exalted One staying,<br />
					that arahant,<br />
					the fully enlightened one?</p>

					<p class="f4">I long to behold that Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yonder is his lodging, maharaja,<br />
					with the door shut.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you go up quietly without nervousness,<br />
					enter the verandah,<br />
					cough and rattle the door-bar.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One will open the door to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the raja Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					went up to the lodging<br />
					as he was told,<br />
					coughed and rattled the door-bar.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One opened the door.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					fell with his head at the <a id="pg47"><span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span></a> feet of the Exalted One,<br />
					kissed his feet<br />
					and stroked them with his hands,<br />
					and announced his name,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> saying,</p>
