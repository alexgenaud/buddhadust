					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Upāli came to see the Exalted One<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side<br />
					seated <a id="pt202" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.099.pali.bd.htm#pg202"><span class="f2">[202]</span></a> at one side he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, I desire to frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br />
					to be a lodger in solitude."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Upāli, to frequent woodland haunts in the forest<br />
					and to be a lodger in solitude<br />
					are things hard to compass.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A hard thing it is to dwell secluded;<br />
					it is hard to find delight in living alone;<br />
					the woods strain the mind,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> methinks,<br />
					of a monk who has not won concentration of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, Upāli, should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though I have not won concentration of mind,<br />
					yet I will frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br />
					I will be a lodger in solitude,'</p>

					<p class="f4">of him it is to be expected<br />
					that either he will sink to the bottom<br />
					or float on the surface.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Upāli, a great pool of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then comes a bull elephant<br />
					seven<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> or eight cubits<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> in height.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose I plunge into this pool of water<br />
					and amuse myself with the sport<br />
					of squirting water into my ears<br />
					or over my back.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I have enjoyed this sport<br />
					and washed<br />
					and drunk<br />
					and come out again,<br />
					suppose I go whithersoever it pleases me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So in he goes and does so,<br />
					comes out again<br />
					and goes whithersoever it pleases him.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can he do it?</p>

					<p class="f4">The great bulk of his person, Upāli,<br />
					finds a footing in deep water.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt203" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.099.pali.bd.htm#pg203"><span class="f2">[203]</span></a> But suppose a hare<br />
					or a cat<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					should come and say to itself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What difference is there between myself<br />
					and a bull elephant?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I plunge into this pool of water<br />
					and amuse myself with the sport<br />
					of squirting water into my ears<br />
					or over my back?</p>

					<p class="f4">When I have enjoyed this sport<br />
					and washed<br />
					and drunk<br />
					and come out again,<br />
					suppose I go whithersoever it pleases me?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> So he springs into that pool of water hastily<br />
					and without consideration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this is to be expected of him:<br />
					either he will sink to the bottom<br />
					or float on the surface.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">The smallness of his person, Upāli,<br />
					finds no footing in deep water.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Upāli,<br />
					whoso should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though I have not won concentration of mind,<br />
					yet I will frequent woodland haunts in the forest,<br />
					I will be a lodger in solitude' -</p>

					<p class="f4">of him it is to be expected<br />
					that either he will sink to the bottom<br />
					or float on the surface.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Upāli,<br />
					suppose a tender boy-child,<br />
					feeble<br />
					and lying on his back<br />
					and playing with his own excrements.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Upāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not this childish sport<br />
					come to completion and fullness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Upāli,<br />
					that boy-child<br />
					on another occasion,<br />
					when he has grown older,<br />
					following on the ripening of the sense-faculties,<br />
					plays with whatever may be the playthings of such children,<br />
					such as a toy-plough,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					tip-cat,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					somersaults,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> windmills,<br />
					leaf-pannikins,<br />
					toy-carts<br />
					and toy-bows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, Upāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not this game<br />
					come to be finer<br />
					and more valued<br />
					than the former?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Upāli,<br />
					that child later on,<br />
					when he has grown older<br />
					owing to the ripening of his sense-faculties,<br />
					and has come into possession<br />
					of the five sense-pleasures<br />
					and is possessed by them,<br />
					he becomes a prey to them,<br />
					to objects cognizable by the eye,<br />
					objects desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					fascinating,<br />
					attractive:<br />
					to sounds cognizable by the ear<br />
					to odours cognizable by the nose,<br />
					tastes cognizable by the tongue,<br />
					<a id="pt204" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.099.pali.bd.htm#pg204"><span class="f2">[204]</span></a> touches cognizable by the body,<br />
					things concerned with sensual desires<br />
					and passionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what <a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> think you, Upāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does not this game<br />
					come to be finer<br />

					than the former?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now look you,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Upāli.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Wayfarer arises in the world,<br />
					an arahant,<br />
					one rightly enlightened,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Wellfarer,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					an unsurpassed trainer of men who can be trained,<br />
					a teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					an awakened one,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world,<br />
					with its Devas,<br />
					its Maras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					its recluses and brahmins,<br />
					its host of devas and mankind,<br />
					himself realizing it<br />
					by his own comprehension.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches dhamma,<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely midway,<br />
					lovely at the end (of life),<br />
					both in its meaning<br />
					and its letter;<br />
					he shows forth the Brahma-life<br />
					utterly fulfilled<br />
					and purified.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a housefather<br />
					or housefather's son<br />
					or one reborn in some family or other<br />
					hears that dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing that dhamma<br />
					he wins faith in the Wayfarer.</p>

					<p class="f4">In possession of that faith<br />
					which he has won<br />
					he ponders thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Oppressive is the home-life,<br />
					a way of dust!</p>

					<p class="f4">The way of going forth<br />
					is of the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy thing<br />
					for one living the household life<br />
					to practise the Brahma-life<br />
					in all its completeness,<br />
					in utter purity<br />
					like a polished shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">How if I were to get the hair of my beard shorn and,<br />
					donning the saffron robe,<br />
					were to go forth from home<br />
					to the homeless?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he, some time later on,<br />
					abandoning the whole mass of his wealth<br />
					whether small or great,<br />
					abandoning his circle of kinsmen<br />
					whether small or great,<br />
					gets the hair of his beard shorn,<br />
					dons the saffron robes<br />
					and goes forth from home<br />
					to the homeless.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having thus gone forth,<br />
					having entered upon the way of life<br />
					in the training followed by the monks,<br />
					abandoning the slaying of creatures<br />
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives as one<br />
					who has laid down the rod,<br />
					who has laid down the knife,<br />
					who has scruples;<br />
					he is kind<br />
					and has compassion<br />
					for every living thing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the taking of what is not given<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives as one<br />
					who takes only what is given,<br />
					who waits for what is given;<br />
					he lives with a self that <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> has become pure,<br />
					not by stealth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the unchaste life<br />
					he lives chaste,<br />
					lives a life aloof,<br />
					abstaining from the sexual act,<br />
					<a id="pt205" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.099.pali.bd.htm#pg205"><span class="f2">[205]</span></a> from dealings with womenfolk.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning falsehood<br />
					he abstains therefrom;<br />
					he speaks the truth,<br />
					joins truth to truth,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					unswerving,<br />
					reliable,<br />
					no deceiver of the world.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at one place<br />
					he spreads it not abroad elsewhere<br />
					to cause dissension among these folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at another place<br />
					he spreads it not abroad elsewhere<br />
					to cause dissension among those folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he reconciles those who are at variance<br />
					and confirms the friendly.</p>

					<p class="f4">He delights in harmony,<br />
					finds pleasure therein,<br />
					rejoices in harmony<br />
					and utters words that make for harmony.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning bitter speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is blameless,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					speech that goes to the heart,<br />
					is urbane,<br />
					delights many folk -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning idle babble<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who speaks in season,<br />
					speaks of facts,<br />
					speaks sense,<br />
					speaks according to dhamma,<br />
					speaks according to the discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks words worth treasuring up,<br />
					words seasonable,<br />
					reasonable,<br />
					discriminating<br />
					and concerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who abstains<br />

							<p><i>No ca kho tāvn anuppatta-sadatthā viharanti.</i> And yet not on that account have they attained their goal. Woodward's second thought is the better understanding (Bhk. Bodhi words this understanding: 'But they still haven't attained their own goal.') because it is often an admonition given to bhikkhus to not give up at a point where self-deception could easily lead to the thought that one has accomplished the goal. But both ideas would miss the point being made here which is to give Upāli an indication of the difficulty of attaining the goal and by that the difficulty of successful forest living. Woodward's idea that one was to give up solitary living once the goal was attained was one which was popular at one time, but which has very little basis in the suttas. Forest living, solitary living is highly praised by Gotama right up to the end as being a great inspiration for those who follow. In other words, forest living <i>is</i> teaching. But it is not suitable for everyone.</p>

The Master replies, 'Bhikkhu, you, dwelling in the forest will develop one subject (dhura) only; whereas if you dwell with us you will become proficient both in 'book'-knowledge (<i>gantha</i>) and insight.'
