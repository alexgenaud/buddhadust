					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/janussoni.htm">brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi</a>,<br />
					the day being the sabbath,<br />
					having washed his head<br />
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br />
					holding a handful of wet <i>kusa</i> grass,<br />
					was standing aside<br />
					not far from the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<br />
					this sabbath day,<br />
					having washed his head<br />
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br />
					thus standing aside<br />
					holding a handful of wet hum grass,<br />
					and on seeing him said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it, brāhmin, that you<br />
					on this sabbath day,<br />
					having washed your head<br />
					and put on a fresh pair of linen cloths,<br />
					thus stand aside<br />
					holding a handful of wet hum grass?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today, Master Gotama,<br />
					is the (ceremony of) descent<br />
					of the brāhmin clan."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what manner, brāhmin,<br />
					is this descent?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, Master Gotama,<br />
					it being the sabbath,<br />
					brāhmins wash the head,<br />
					put on a fresh pair of cloths,<br />
					smear the floor with wet cowdung,<br />
					strew it with wet husa grass,<br />
					and make their bed<br />
					between the boundary and the fire-house.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising up thrice in that night,<br />
					with clasped hands<br />
					they do homage to fire,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We come down to your worship,<br />
					we come down to your worship!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they feed the fire<br />
					with oblation of oil<br />
					of butter<br />
					and fresh butter.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the night has passed<br />
					they feed brāhmins<br />
					with choice food<br />
					both hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Master Gotama,<br />
					is the descent of the brāhmins."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brāhmin, the descent (ceremony) of the brāhmins is one thing,<br />
					the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br />
					is quite another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama,<br />
					in what way is the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan done?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me<br />
					if the worthy Gotama would teach me dhamma<br />
					as to the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brāhmin, do you listen."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, master,"<br />
					replied the brāhmin Jāṇussoṇi<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">"In this matter, brāhmin, the Ariyan disciple thus ponders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of wrong conduct in things sexual<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of bitter speech<br />

					he descends from bitter speech.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of idle babble<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br />
					he abandons idle babble,<br />
					he descends from idle babble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of coveting<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br />

					he descends from coveting.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of harmfulness<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus pondering<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, brāhmin, is the descent<br />
					by the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Master Gotama,<br />
					one thing is the descent of the brāhmins,<br />
					quite another thing is the descent<br />
					by the discipline of the Ariyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, Master Gotama,<br />
					compared with the descent by the discipline of the Ariyan<br />
					that of the brāhmins is not worth one sixteenth part of it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> It is excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br />
					open up the hidden,<br />
					point out the way<br />
					to one gone astray,<br />
					hold up a shining light<br />
					so that they who have eyes<br />
					may see objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus has dhamma been expounded in divers ways by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, worthy Gotama,<br />
					do go for resort to the awakened one,<br />
					to dhamma<br />
					and to the order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the worthy Gotama reckon me as a lay-follower<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					so long as life shall last,<br />
					as one who has gone to him as resort."</p>
