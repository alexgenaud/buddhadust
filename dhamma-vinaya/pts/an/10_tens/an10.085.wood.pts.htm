<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 85. Cunda the Great describes the case of a boaster who brags of attainments and is questioned by one skilled in the jhanas and able to read the state of and habits of the hearts of others. Possessing any of ten characteristics he will come to an impass and ruin when questioned. But if one abandons all these ten characteristics he may come to increase, growth and maturity in this Dhamma-discipline." />
