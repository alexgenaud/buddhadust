					<p class="f4">On that occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One, who said this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> "Monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five conditions<br />

					<p class="f4">A monk who desires to admonish another<br />
					must thus investigate:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br />
					one who practises utter purity in body;<br />
					am I or am I not<br />
					possessed of utter purity in body<br />

					<p class="f4">If he be not so,<br />

					<p class="f4">Folk are found to speak thus.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br />

					<p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br />
					one who practises utter purity in speech,<br />
					flawless and untainted?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br />

					<p class="f4">Folk are found to speak thus.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br />
					should thus investigate:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is a heart of goodwill<br />
					free from malice<br />
					established in me<br />
					towards my fellows in the Brahma-life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br />

					<p class="f4">If it be not so,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br />
					should thus investigate:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Am I or am I not<br />
					one who has heard much,<br />
					who bears in mind what he has heard,<br />
					who hoards up what he has heard?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings which,<br />

					practised in speech,<br />
					pondered in the heart<br />
					and rightly penetrated by view?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this quality manifest in me<br />
					or is it not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, if he be not one who has heard much,<br />
					who bears in mind what he has heard,<br />
					who hoards up what he has heard;</p>

					<p class="f4">those teachings which,<br />
					lovely alike at the beginning,<br />
					the middle<br />
					and the end (of life)<br />

					if such teachings have not been much heard by him,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a monk who desires to admonish another<br />

					sutta by sutta<br />

					<p class="f4">Is this condition manifest in me<br />
					or is it not?'</p>

					<p class="f4">For if not there are found folk to say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'But where was this said by the Exalted One, your reverence?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When thus questioned he cannot explain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there will be those who say:</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be found folk to speak thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">(He considers:)</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these five conditions<br />
