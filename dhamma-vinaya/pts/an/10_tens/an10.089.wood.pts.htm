					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna</a> have wicked desires,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then for a second time the Kokālikan monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires,<br />
					they are a prey to wicked desires."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the Exalted One reproved him saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					<p class="f4">Say not so, Kokālikan!</p>

					keeping his right side towards him,<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after he had departed<br />
					the whole body of the Kokālikan monk<br />

					of the size of mustard-seed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">From being of the size of mustard-seed<br />

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">And there he lay on plantain leaves,<br />
					just like a poisoned fish.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Tudu, the individual Brahmā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					went to see the Kokālikan monk,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Tudu the individual Brahmā<br />
					addressed the Kokālikan monk<br />
					in these verses:</p>

							Wherewith the fool, whene'er he speaks<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">Small is the ill-luck of a man<br />
							Who gambling loseth all his wealth.<br />
							Greater by far th' ill-luck of him<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Kokālikan monk<br />
					met his end by that same sickness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had made an end<br />
					he rose up again in Paduma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> Purgatory,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the night was far spent,<br />
					the Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					shedding radiance<br />
					lit up Jeta Grove from end to end,<br />
					and came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him and stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus standing<br />
					the Brahmā Sahampati said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the Kokālikan monk has met his end,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Brahmā Sahampati,<br />

					and vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One,<br />
					when that night had gone,<br />
					addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, sir, how long is the measure of life in Paduma Purgatory?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long indeed, monk, is the measure of life in Paduma Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">It were no easy thing to reckon it thus:</p>
