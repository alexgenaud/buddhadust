					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in the southern districts<br />
					there is an ablution.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion<br />
					there are food and drink,<br />

					dancing,<br />
					singing<br />
					and music of instruments.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, this is just a wiping,<br />
					not a wiping out,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">For that ablution is low,<br />
					common,<br />
					vulgar,<br />
					unariyan,<br />
					not bringing profit;<br />
					it conduces not to revulsion,<br />
					to fading,<br />
					to ending,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I will teach you<br />
