					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this to those Sakyan lay-followers:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Sakyans, in those matters<br />

					it is ill gotten by you,<br />
					since, in a life thus conjoined to fear of grief,<br />
					in a life thus conjoined to fear of death,<br />
