<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 83. Punniya, asks why it is that sometimes the Buddha will teach and sometimes not. Gotama explains that there are ten factors involved, but that more than the simple ten factors what is needed is to see progress up the ten factors in a bhikkhu. So sometimes a teaching may be given with only some of the factors and other times not when even one is missing." />
