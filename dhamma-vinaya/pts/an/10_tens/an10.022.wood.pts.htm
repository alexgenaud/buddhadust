					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side<br />
					and the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatsoever things, Ānanda,<br />
					conduce to realizing the truth<br />
					of this or that statement of doctrine,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					confidently do I claim,<br />
					after thorough comprehension of it,<br />
					to teach dhamma about them<br />
					in such a way that,<br />
					when proficient,<br />
					a man shall know of the real that it is,<br />
					of the unreal that it is not;<br />
					of the mean that it is mean,<br />
					of the exalted that it is exalted;<br />
					of that which has something beyond it,<br />
					that it has something beyond it;<br />
					of that which is unsurpassed,<br />
					that it is unsurpassed.</p>

					<p class="f4">For there is the possibility<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of his knowing<br />
					or seeing<br />
					or realizing that which can be known,<br />
					seen or realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda, is knowledge unsurpassable,<br />
					the knowledge of this or that thing<br />
					as it really is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Than this knowledge, Ānanda,<br />
					there is no other knowledge surpassing it<br />
					or more excellent,<br />
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, there are these ten Wayfarer's powers<br />

					<p class="f4">What are the ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda, the Wayfarer knows,<br />

					causal occasion (of a thing) as such,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the Wayfarer can recall<br />

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />

					three, four, five,<br />

					<p class="f4">(remembering):</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time I had such a name,<br />
