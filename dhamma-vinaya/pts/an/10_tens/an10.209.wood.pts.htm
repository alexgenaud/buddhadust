					<p class="f4">Now a certain brāhmin came to see the Exalted One, and on coming to him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause why certain beings of this world,<br />
					when body breaks up, beyond death rise up again in the Waste, the Ill-bourn, the Downfall, in Purgatory?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, the reason and cause for this are conduct that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why beings are so born."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But pray, Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause why certain beings of this world,<br />
					when body breaks up, beyond death rise up again in the Happy Bourn, the heaven-world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahmin, the reason and cause are conduct that is dhflmma. and straight ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the reason why they are so reborn."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"For my part I don't understand in full the meaning of this pronouncement in brief made by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me if the worthy Gotama would teach me dhamma in <a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> such a way that I could understand in full the meaning of this brief utterance of the worthy Gotama."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then listen, brāhmin. Pay attention carefully and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, master," replied that brāhmin to the Exalted One, who said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Threefold, brāhmin, is conduct by body that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fourfold brāhmin, is conduct by speech that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Threefold brāhmin, is conduct by mind that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is bodily conduct that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, brāhmin,<br />
					a certain one takes life,<br />
					he is a hunter,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					given over to killing and slaying,<br />
					void of compassion to all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain one takes what is not given;<br />
					he takes with thievish intent<br />
					things not given to him,<br />
					the property of another person,<br />
					situated in jungle<br />
					or in village.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />
					he is a wrong-doer;<br />
					he has intercourse with girls in ward of mother or father,<br />
					brother,<br />
					sister<br />
					or relatives (or clan);<br />
					with girls lawfully guarded,<br />
					already pledged to a husband<br />
					and protected by the rod,<br />
					even with girls crowned with the flower-garland (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bodily conduct that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life threefold.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is conduct by speech that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life fourfold?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, brāhmin,<br />
					a certain one is a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br />
					or a company<br />
					or amid his relatives<br />
					or guild-men<br />
					or before the royal family<br />
					and asked to bear witness<br />
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good fellow!<br />
					Say what you know.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he knows not, he says, 'I know';<br />
					though he knows, he says, 'I know not';<br />
					though he has not seen, he says 'I saw';<br />
					though he saw, he says 'I saw not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br />
					or that of others<br />
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br />
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br />
					he proclaims it somewhere else<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					he repeats there<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br />
					foments strife between those discordant,<br />
					discord is his delight;<br />
					exulting in<br />
					and passionately fond of discord,<br />
					he utters speech<br />
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br />
					cutting,<br />
					bitter about others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					provoking wrath<br />
					and conducive to distraction -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br />
					he speaks out of season,<br />
					speaks unrealities;<br />
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br />
					what is not-dhamma<br />
					and not-discipline;<br />
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech unreasonable<br />
					and not worth listening to,<br />
					undiscriminating<br />
					and unconcerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is conduct by speech that is not-dhamma and crooked ways of life fourfold.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br />

					be destroyed,<br />
					not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br />
					he is perverse in outlook,<br />

					no offering,<br />
					no sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done;<br />
					this world is not,<br />

					there is no mother,<br />
					no father,<br />
					no beings supernaturally born;<br />
					there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br />
					who have gone right,<br />
					who fare rightly,<br />
					men who by their own comprehension<br />
					have realized this world<br />
					and the world beyond<br />
					and thus declare.</p>
