							<p>'Purgatory' is Woodward's suggested translation for <i>Niraye,</i> Hell, in accordance with a precise understanding of the Judeo-Christian concept where 'Hell' proper is eternal and Purgatory temporary. Since Niraye is a temporary condition, was the thinking, this could not qualify it to be called Hell. The Buddhist position, is that there is no state of existence which is eternal. The common understanding of the idea of Hell today will do for life in Niraye, which can last to the end of a world cycle.</p>
