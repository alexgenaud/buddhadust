					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Bhk. Bodhi has this as a separate sutta. Woodward has abridged this such that the two questions are put as one where the question asked is: "... a monk how qualified should tutelage be assigned ...<i>[his elipsis]</i> and a novice provided for?" and words the conclusion: "... must possess ... in order to assign tutelage and provide for a novice." The question is ambiguous concerning whether this means caring for a novice or having a novice assigned as an attendant. The answer implies that the issue is the care of the novice. The wording here has been reworked to fit a separate question and answer and with the idea that the question is the qualifications of the bhikkhu to have an attendent. See: Bhk. Bodhi where he has this as "...possess to be attended upon by a novice?" and "...may be attended upon by a novice." <i>bhikkhunā sāmaṇero upaṭṭhāpetabbo</i></p>
