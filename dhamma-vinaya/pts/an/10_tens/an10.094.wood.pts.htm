					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#campa">Campā</a><br />
					on the bank of the Lotus Pond at Gaggara.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather Vajjiyamāhita left Campa at an early hour to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it occurred to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not time to see the Exalted One,<br />
					he is in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is it time to see the monks<br />
					who make the mind to grow;<br />
					those monks are in retirement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I were to pay a visit<br />
					to the Park where dwell<br />
					the Wanderers who hold other views."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Vajjiyamāhita drew near<br />
					the Park where dwelt<br />
					the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					the Wanderers holding other views,<br />
					having come together in a great company,<br />
					were sitting engaged in divers childish talk,<br />
					all talking loudly,<br />
					making a great noise and din.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they saw the housefather Vajjiyamāhita approaching,<br />
					while yet he was at some distance,<br />
					they hushed each other, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Make little noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Make no noise, your reverence!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br />
					a disciple of Gotama the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">This housefather Vajjiyamāhita<br />
					is one of those disciples of Gotama the recluse,<br />
					householders clad in white,<br />
					who live at Campā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those worthies are fond of little noise,<br />
					they are schooled to little noise,<br />
					they speak in praise of little noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if he sees our company making little noise,<br />
					he will think it worth his while to draw near."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt190" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.094.pali.bd.htm#pg190"><span class="f2">[190]</span></a> So those Wanderers kept silence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the housefather Vajjiyamāhita drew near to those Wanderers,<br />
					and on coming to them<br />
					greeted them courteously,<br />
					and after courteous greetings<br />
					and reminiscent talk<br />
					<a id="pg131"><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></a> sat down at one side.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat<br />
					those Wanderers holding other views said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, housefather,<br />
					as it is said,<br />
					that Gotama the recluse blames all ascetic ways,<br />
					that he downright upbraids and reproaches<br />
					every ascetic who lives the hard life?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"No indeed, sirs,<br />
					the Exalted One blames not all ascetic ways,<br />
					nor does he downright upbraid and reproach<br />
					every ascetic who lives the hard life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One, sirs,<br />
					blames the blameworthy,<br />
					praises the praiseworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so doing the Exalted One is a particularizer;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that Exalted One is not one<br />
					who makes sweeping assertions herein."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain Wanderer said this to the housefather Vajjiyamāhita:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stay thou, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">That Gotama the recluse,<br />
					whose praises you utter,<br />
					is a nihilist,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					one who defines nothing as certain."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nay, sir, herein I speak with good reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One has thus defined:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is good;<br />
					that is bad.'</p>

					<p class="f4">By thus defining good and bad<br />
					the Exalted One is a definer.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is no nihilist,<br />
					not one who defines nothing as certain."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt191" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.094.pali.bd.htm#pg191"><span class="f2">[191]</span></a>At these words those Wanderers were silent,<br />
					were confounded,<br />
					hung the head,<br />
					looked downwards,<br />
					were disappointed,<br />
					and sat unable to make reply.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br />
					seeing that those Wanderers were confounded,<br />
					hung the head,<br />
					looked downwards,<br />
					were disappointed,<br />
					and sat unable to make reply,<br />
					rose up from his seat<br />
					rose up from his seat<br />
					and went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him,<br />
					saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated he related<br />
					all the conversation he had had<br />
					with the Wanderers holding other views.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well done, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well done, housefather!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even <a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> thus reasonably<br />

					from time to time<br />
					to be confuted and rebuked by you.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, housefather,<br />
					I say not that all ascetic ways are to be pursued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet do I not say<br />
					that all ascetic ways are not to be pursued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the housefather Vajjiyamāhita,<br />
					being thus instructed,<br />
					stirred,<br />
					fired<br />
					and gladdened by the Exalted One,<br />
					rose up from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One by keeping his right side towards him<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Not long after he had gone<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, any monk who had been for a long time<br />
					stained with but few faults<br />
					in this Dhamma-discipline<br />
