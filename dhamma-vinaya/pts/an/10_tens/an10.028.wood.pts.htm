[note: So <i>vaḍḍhan-iyo,</i> the Commentary's equivalent a 'growe-er' (See p. 192, n.3] Let the reader not think I comment on trifles. In the wording of growth, of a making to grow, making become, we have the once central driving force that arose with Buddhism. That man 'is' was not enough. Man must become a More, else never will he attain to his full stature as God: - here is original Buddhism carrying out to the Many the torch drooping in the hands of the Brahman teaching of the Few." [Ed.: Caution! This is Mrs. Rhys Davids infliction of her personal view on the reader. There is nothing in the Suttas to support the idea that man is to become Cap G God or, in fact, to 'become' anything as a final goal. Following the teachings one is to make become or develop to the point where becoming is abandoned.]</p>
