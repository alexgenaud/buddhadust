					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, physicians administer an emetic<br />
					for checking sickness arising from bile,<br />
					phlegm,<br />
					for checking sickness arising from wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is an emetic, monks, but not a wiping out,<br />
					I declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I will teach you the Ariyan emetic,<br />
					an emetic which works and fails not;<br />
					an emetic by which beings subject to rebirth<br />
