					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion a number of monks<br />
					after returning from their alms-round<br />
					and eating their meal,<br />
					as they sat assembled together in the service-hall,<br />
					remained in strife and uproar and dispute,<br />
					abusing each other<br />
					with the weapons of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One at eventide,<br />
					rising from his solitude,<br />
					approached the service-hall,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had sat down<br />
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, monks, in what talk were ye engaged<br />
					as ye sit here,<br />
					and what was the topic of your talk<br />
					left unfinished?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Here, sir, after returning from our alms-round<br />

					we sat assembled together in the service-hall<br />
					and remained in strife, uproar and dispute,<br />
					abusing each other<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, it is not seemly for you clansmen,<br />
					who in faith went forth from home to the homeless,<br />
