<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 96. Kokanuda the wanderer asks Ānanda about whether or not he holds any of ten well-known views concerning existence and non-existence each of which is answered by the statement by Ānanda that he does not hold such a view. When questioned further ananda explains that these are just points of view, fixing on points of view, reliance on points of view, obsession by points of view and as such are things that should be let go (risen up from) and rooted out." />
