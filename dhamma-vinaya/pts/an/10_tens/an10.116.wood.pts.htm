<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 116. Ajita approaches the Buddha and describes what he understands to be a sage. Gotama responds by describing that a sage in this sytem is to be understood as one who argues according to dhamma. Gotama then enumerates ten general areas to be considered good form and which are the goal and ten which are not good form and which are not the goal." />

					<p class="f4">Now Ajita<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Wanderer came to see the Exalted One,<br />

					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Ajita the Wanderer said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, we have a fellow in the Brahma-life<br />

					<p class="f4">He has thought out as many as five hundred mental states<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">'We are reproached,'"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One called to the monks, saying:</p>

					the grounds for (being called) a sage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time for this, 0 Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever the Exalted One may say,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then listen, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay careful attention and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One,<br />
