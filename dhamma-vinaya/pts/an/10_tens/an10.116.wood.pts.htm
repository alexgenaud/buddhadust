<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 116. Ajita approaches the Buddha and describes what he understands to be a sage. Gotama responds by describing that a sage in this sytem is to be understood as one who argues according to dhamma. Gotama then enumerates ten general areas to be considered good form and which are the goal and ten which are not good form and which are not the goal." />

					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One called to the monks, saying:</p>

					the grounds for (being called) a sage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now is the time for this, Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever the Exalted One may say,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then listen, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay careful attention and I will speak."</p>
