					stirred,<br />
					fired,<br />
					and gladdened the monks<br />
					with a talk about dhamma<br />
					on looking round<br />
					and seeing that the order of monks was perfectly silent,<br />
					he called to the venerable Sāriputta, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta, the order of monks has banished sloth-and-torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let some dhamma-talk occur to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">My back aches.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will ease it."</p>
