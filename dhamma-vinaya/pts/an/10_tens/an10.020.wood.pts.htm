					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a monk guard one factor?</p>

					<p class="f4">By guarding mindfulness<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein in a monk longing for things sensual is abandoned,<br />
					longing for becoming is abandoned,<br />
					longing for the brahma-life has calmed down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by abandoning pleasure and pain,<br />
					by coming <a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> to an end of the ease and discomfort which he had before,<br />
					attains and abides in a state of neither pain nor pleasure,<br />

					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />

					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>
