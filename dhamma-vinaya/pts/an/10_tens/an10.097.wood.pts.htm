					<p class="f4">Once on a time the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of ten<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> qualities a monk is worshipful,<br />
					worthy of honour,<br />
					worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of being saluted with clasped hands,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<br />
					he dwells restrained with the restraint of the obligation,<br />
					well equipped in range of practice,<br />
					seeing grounds for fear in minutest faults,<br />
					he takes up and trains himself<br />
					in the training of the precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again a monk has heard much;<br />
					he bears in mind what he has heard,<br />
					he stores up what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt199" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.097.pali.bd.htm#pg199"><span class="f2">[199]</span></a>Whatsoever teachings,<br />
					lovely at the beginning,<br />
					lovely midway,<br />
					lovely at the end (of life),<br />
					in spirit and in letter<br />
					do stress the brahma-life<br />
					in its all-round fullness<br />
					and utter purity,<br />
					such teachings are much heard by him,<br />
					borne in mind,<br />
					repeated aloud,<br />
					pondered<br />
					and well penetrated by vision.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again a monk has a friendship with the lovely,<br />
					fellowship with the lovely,<br />
					companionship with the lovely.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who has right view,<br />
					he is possessed of right seeing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he enjoys divers sorts of more-power:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">manifest or invisible<br />

					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if through air:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">he plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">even as far as the Brahma-world<br />
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-power of hearing,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					he can hear sound both of devas and of humans,<br />
					whether far or near.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know the minds of other beings,<br />

					<p class="f4">Of the mind that is released,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his former dwelling in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt200" href="../../../pali/an/10_tens/an10.097.pali.bd.htm#pg200"><span class="f2">[200]</span></a>One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three, four, five,<br />
					even ten births,<br />
					twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births;<br />
					even a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand, a hundred thousand births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise the divers folding up of aeons,<br />
					the divers unfolding of aeons,<br />
					the divers folding-unfolding of aeons.</p>

					<p class="f4">(remembering):</p>

					<p class="f4">'At that time I had such a name,<br />
					was of such a family,<br />
					of such complexion,<br />
					was thus supported,<br />
					thus and thus experienced weal and woe,<br />
					had such and such span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">As that one,<br />
					I deceasing thence<br />
					rose up again at that time;<br />
					then too I had such a name,<br />
					was of such a family,<br />
					of such complexion,<br />
					was thus supported,<br />
					thus and thus experienced weal and woe,<br />
					had such and such span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">As that one,<br />
					I deceasing thence rose up again here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with all details and characteristics<br />
					he can recall his manifold dwellings aforetime.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, sir, the Exalted One with the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					beholds beings deceasing<br />
					and rising up again;<br />
					beings both mean and excellent,<br />
					fair and foul,<br />
					gone to a happy bourn,<br />
					gone to an ill-bourn<br />
					according to their deeds<br />
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas, sirs, these beings,<br />
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br />
					of evil words,<br />
					of evil thoughts,<br />
					scoffing at the Ariyans,<br />
					of perverted view<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their perverted view -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					when body broke up,<br />
					beyond death rose up again in the Waste,<br />
					the Ill-bourn,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					in Purgatory!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ah, sirs, these beings,<br />
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br />
					of good words,<br />
					of good thoughts,<br />
					no scoffers at the Ariyans,<br />
					but of <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> sound view<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their sound view -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					when body broke up,<br />
					beyond death rose up again in the Happy Bourn<br />
					in the heaven world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					beholds beings deceasing<br />
					and rising up again;<br />
					beings both mean and excellent,<br />
					fair and foul,<br />
					gone to a happy bourn,<br />
					gone to an ill-bourn<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the destruction of the cankers,<br />
					in this same visible state<br />
					he attains the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					that is freed of the cankers,<br />
					himself thoroughly comprehending it,<br />
					and realizing it abides therein.</p>
