					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the housefather <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> came to see the Exalted One<br />

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when the fivefold guilty dread<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					he may, if he so desire,<br />
					himself proclaim thus of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am one who has cut off the doom of Purgatory,<br />

					<p class="f4">And of what four limbs of stream-winning is he possessed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, the Ariyan disciple<br />
					is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Enlightened One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">That Exalted One is arahant,<br />
					a perfectly enlightened one,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					a Wellfarer,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed trainer of men who can be trained,<br />
					Teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha is the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering confidence in dhamma, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is dhamma,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Well faring onward<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> Herein, housefather, the Ariyan disciple thus reflects:</p>

							<b>By the arising of this, that arises.</b><br />
							<b>This not being, that is not.</b><br />
							<b>By the ending of this, that comes to cease.'</b></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of ignorance, the activities;<br />
					because of the activities, conscious being;<br />
					because of conscious being, name-and-shape;<br />
					because of name-and-shape, the six centres of sense;<br />
					because of the six centres of sense, contact;<br />
					because of contact, feeling;<br />
					because of feeling, craving;<br />

					because of birth, decay-and-death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and woe,<br />
					dejection<br />
					and despair<br />
					come into being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is the arising of this whole mass of ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But with the waning<br />
					and utter ceasing without remainder<br />
					of ignorance, the ending of the activities;<br />
					with the ending of the activities, the ending of conscious being;<br />
					with the ending of conscious being, the ending of name-and-shape;<br />
					with the ending of name-and-shape, the ending of the six centres of sense;<br />

					with the ending of craving, the ending of grasping;<br />
					with the ending of grasping, the ending of becoming;<br />
					with the ending of becoming, the ending of birth;<br />
					with the ending of birth,<br />
					decay-and-death,<br />
					grief,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and woe,<br />
					dejection<br />
					and despair<br />
					cease to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is the ending<br />
					of this whole mass of ill,<br />
					and this for him<br />
					is the Ariyan Method well seen,<br />
					well penetrated by insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, since for the Ariyan disciple<br />
					these five guilty dreads are allayed,<br />
					and he is possessed of these four limbs of stream-winning,<br />
					and for him this Ariyan Method<br />

					he, if he so desires,<br />
					himself<br />
					may proclaim of himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is Purgatory for me,<br />
					destroyed is birth in the womb of an animal,<br />
					destroyed is the realm of ghosts,<br />
					destroyed is (rebirth in) the Waste,<br />

					in Purgatory;<br />
					a stream-winner am I,<br />
