					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying at Pava<br />
					in the mango grove of Cunda, the son of the silversmith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Cunda, son of the silversmith,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cunda, in whose purifying rites do you find satisfaction?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, the brāhmins of the west<br />
					who carry waterpots<br />
					and <a id="pg176"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span></a> wear lily-garlands,<br />
					who are purifiers by water,<br />
					fire-worshippers,<br />
					enjoin purifying rites.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In those I find satisfaction."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In what way, Cunda,<br />
					do those brāhmins who carry water-pots<br />
					and wear lily-garlands,<br />
					who are purifiers by water,<br />
					fire-worshippers,<br />
					enjoin their purifying rites?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, sir, those brāhmins who carry waterpots<br />
					and wear lily-garlands,<br />
					who are purifiers by water,<br />
					fire-worshippers,<br />
					thus instruct a follower:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come now, good fellow,<br />
					rise up in good time<br />
					from your bed<br />
					and touch the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you do not touch the ground,<br />
					touch wet cowdung.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you do not touch wet cowdung,<br />
					touch green grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you do not touch green grass,<br />
					worship fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you do not worship fire,<br />
					adore the sun with clasped hands.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you do not adore the sun with clasped hands,<br />
					descend into water for the third time<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> in the evening.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, sir, do the brāhmins who carry waterpots<br />
					and wear lily-garlands,<br />
					who are purifiers by water,<br />
					fire-worshippers,<br />
					enjoin purifying rites.</p>

					<p class="f4">In them do I find satisfaction."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Cunda, the purifying rites<br />
					enjoined by those brāhmins<br />
					are quite different from the purification in the discipline of the Ariyan."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"In what way, sir,<br />
					is there purification in the discipline of the Ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me, sir,<br />
					if the Exalted One would teach me dhamma<br />
					about the discipline of the Ariyan."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, Cunda, do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay attention carefully<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I will, sir," replied Cunda, the son of the silversmith, to the Exalted One,<br />
					who said this:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Threefold, Cunda, is defilement by body;<br />
					fourfold is defilement by speech;<br />
					threefold is defilement by thought.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is defilement by body threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one takes life,<br />
					he is a hunter,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					given up to killing and slaying,<br />
					void of compassion for all living creatures.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain one takes what is not given;<br />
					he takes with thievish intent<br />
					things not given to him,<br />
					the property of another person,<br />
					situated in jungle<br />
					or in village.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />
					he is a wrong-doer;<br />
					he has intercourse with girls in ward of mother or father,<br />
					brother,<br />
					<a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a> sister<br />
					or relatives (or clan);<br />
					with girls lawfully guarded,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					already pledged to a husband<br />
					and protected by the rod,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even with girls crowned with the flower-garland (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, threefold is defilement by body.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, Cunda, is defilement by speech fourfold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, Cunda, a certain one is a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br />
					or a company<br />
					or amid his relatives<br />
					or guild-men<br />
					or before the royal family<br />
					and asked to bear witness<br />
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, good fellow!<br />
					Say what you know."</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he knows not, he says, 'I know';<br />
					though he knows, he says, 'I know not';<br />
					though he has not seen, he says 'I saw';<br />
					though he saw, he says 'I saw not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br />
					or that of others<br />
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br />
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br />
					he proclaims it somewhere else<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					he repeats there<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br />
					foments strife between those discordant,<br />
					discord is his delight;<br />
					exulting in<br />
					and passionately fond of discord,<br />
					he utters speech<br />
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					cutting,<br />
					bitter about others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					provoking wrath<br />
					and conducive to distraction -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br />
					he speaks out of season,<br />
					speaks unrealities;<br />
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br />
					what is not-dhamma<br />
					and not-discipline;<br />
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech unreasonable<br />
					and not worth listening to,<br />
					undiscriminating<br />
					and unconcerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, defilement by speech is fourfold.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is defilement by mind threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one is covetous,<br />
					he is one who covets <a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> the property of another,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"O that what is another's were mine!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br />
					the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings be slain,<br />
					come to destruction,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					be destroyed,<br />
					not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br />
					he is perverse in outlook,<br />
					holding:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is no gift,<br />
					no offering,<br />
					no sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done;<br />
					this world is not,<br />
					the world beyond is not;<br />
					there is no mother,<br />
					no father,<br />
					no beings supernaturally born;<br />
					there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br />
					who have gone right,<br />
					who fare rightly,<br />
					men who by their own comprehension<br />
					have realized this world<br />
					and the world beyond<br />
					and thus declare.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, defilement by mind is threefold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cunda, there are those ten ways of wrong action.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">One characterized by those ten ways of wrong action<br />
					may rise up early<br />
					and at eventide<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> touch the earth,<br />
					yet is he still impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if he touch not the earth<br />
					he is equally impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he handle cowdung he is impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if he does not handle cowdung<br />
					he is equally impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may handle green grasses or not</p>

					<p class="f4">He may worship the fire or not</p>

					<p class="f4">He may clasp his hands<br />
					and bow to the sun or not,<br />
					he is impure just the same.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may descend in the evening into water for the third time<br />
					or not,<br />
					yet is he still impure.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those ten ways of wrong action, Cunda,<br />
					are impure<br />
					and cause impurity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, as a result of being characterized<br />
					by those ten ways of wrong action,<br />
					purgatory is declared,<br />
					birth in the womb of animals is declared,<br />
					the realm of ghosts is declared,<br />
					either that or some other form of ill-bourn.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Cunda, threefold is cleansing by body,<br />
					fourfold is cleansing by speech,<br />
					threefold is cleansing by mind.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is cleansing by body threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one abandons taking life,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					he has laid aside the rod,<br />
					has laid aside the knife;<br />
					he dwells modest,<br />
					charitable,<br />
					feeling compassion towards every living creature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons taking what is not given,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					<a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> the property of another,<br />
					situated in jungle or in village,<br />
					if not given,<br />
					he takes not with thievish intent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />
					he abandons wrong action,<br />
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He has no intercourse<br />
					with girls in ward of mother or father,<br />
					of brother,<br />
					sister<br />
					or relatives (or clan),<br />
					with girls lawfully guarded,<br />
					already plighted to a husband<br />
					and protected by the rod,<br />
					even with girls crowned<br />
					with the flower-garlands (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, threefold is cleansing by body.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is cleansing by speech fourfold?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Cunda, a certain one abandons lying speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br />
					or a company<br />
					or amid his relatives<br />
					or guild-men<br />
					or before the royal family<br />
					and asked to bear witness<br />
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good fellow!<br />
					Say what you know.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If he knows not, he says, 'I know not';<br />
					if he knows, he says, 'I know';<br />
					if he has not seen, he says 'I saw not';<br />
					if he saw, he says 'I saw'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus neither for his own sake<br />
					or that of others<br />
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br />
					does he deliberately utter falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at one place<br />
					he does not proclaim it elsewhere<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					he does not report there<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br />
					thus he brings together the discordant,<br />
					restores harmony,<br />
					harmony is his delight,<br />
					he exults in,<br />
					is passionately fond of harmony;<br />
					he utters speech that makes for harmony.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he abandons harsh speech,<br />
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					agreeable to many folk,<br />
					delightful to many folk,<br />
					of such speech he is a speaker.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also abandoning idle babble<br />
					he abstains therefrom;<br />
					he speaks in season,<br />
					of facts,<br />
					of the aim,<br />
					of dhamma,<br />
					of discipline;<br />
					he utters speech worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech seasonable<br />
					and worth listening to,<br />
					discriminating<br />
					and concerned with the aim.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, fourfold is cleansing by speech.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is cleansing by mind threefold?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one is not covetous;<br />
					he covets not the property of another,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'0 that what is another's were mine!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not malevolent of heart,<br />
					the thoughts of his heart<br />
					are not corrupt.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings carry about the self<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> in peace,<br />
					free from enmity,<br />
					free from sorrow<br />
					and in happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has right view;<br />
					he is reasonable in outlook,<br />
					holding that there are such things as gift,<br />
					offering,<br />
					oblation,<br />
					fruit and ripening of deeds<br />
					done well or ill;<br />
					that this world is,<br />
					<a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> that the world beyond is;<br />
					that mother, father and beings of supernatural birth (in other worlds) do exist;<br />
					that there are in the world recluses and brāhmins<br />
					who have gone rightly,<br />
					who fare rightly,<br />
					men who of their own comprehension<br />
					have realized this world and the world beyond<br />
					and thus declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Cunda, threefold is the cleansing by the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the ten ways of right doing.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">One characterized by those ten ways<br />
					may rise up early<br />
					and at evening<br />
					touch the earth,<br />
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he touch not the earth,<br />
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he handle cowdung or not,<br />
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he handle green grasses or not,<br />
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he worship the fire or not,<br />
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he clasp his hands and bow down to the sun or not,<br />
					yet is he pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whether he descend in the evening into water for the third time or not,<br />
					yet is he pure for all that.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Cunda, those ten ways of right action<br />
					are pure<br />
					and work purity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By being characterized by those ten ways of right action<br />
					(the state of) devahood is proclaimed,<br />
					of mankind is proclaimed,<br />
					or whatsoever other happy bourn there be.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Cunda, the son of the silversmith, exclaimed to the Exalted One:</p>
