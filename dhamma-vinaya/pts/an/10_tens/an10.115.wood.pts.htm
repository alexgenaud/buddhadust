					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> The whole of this section, down to "Well done, monks!" is abbreviated by Woodward as follows:<br />
					<i>(and they repeated their thoughts of a visit to Ānanda) ... So, sir, we went to see the venerable Ānanda and asked him the meaning of this. Then to us here the meaning of it was well detailed with these reasons, in these words, in these particulars by the venerable Ānanda.'</i><br />
					The detailed meaning, but not the introductory matter, is abbreviated in a similar way in the Pali, not with the more usual "...pe..." .</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> At this point Woodward, following the Pali, abbreviates by omitting the final repetition completely, but we have many cases where the usual habit is as here in this version. The idea is rehersal to insure accurate memory. The commentary cited by Woodward above would have the initial exposition in brief be a simple excuse by Gotama to hear his own praises. This is unworthy of the commentator, not to mention Gotama, and more likely is the knowledge from previous experience, that Ānanda or some other Bhikkhu of experience would be sought out by the bhikkhus and that the teaching would by that become further developed and memorialized. We can see from the previous few suttas that this is an evolving sutta and the development here is one we have seen prevously for other suttas.</p>
