					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, were not three states found existing in the world,<br />
					the Wayfarer would not arise in the world,<br />
					an arahant rightly enlightened;<br />
					nor would the Dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer<br />

					<p class="f4">What are the three states?</p>
