							<p>'Purgatory' is Woodward's suggested translation for <i>Niraye,</i> Hell, in accordance with a precise understanding of the Judeo-Christian concept where 'Hell' proper is eternal and Purgatory temporary. Since Niraye is a temporary condition, was the thinking, this could not qualify it to be called Hell. The Buddhist position, is that there is no state of existence which is eternal. The common understanding of the idea of Hell today will do for life in Niraye, which can last to the end of a world cycle, but not forever.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, characterized by ten qualities<br />
					one is cast into purgatory according<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one takes life,<br />
					he is a hunter,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					given up to killing and slaying,<br />
					void of compassion for all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain one takes what is not given;<br />
					he takes with thievish intent<br />
					things not given to him,<br />
					the property of another person,<br />
					situated in jungle<br />
					or in village.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />
					he is a wrong-doer;<br />
					he has intercourse with girls in ward of mother or father,<br />
					brother,<br />
					sister<br />
					or relatives (or clan);<br />
					with girls lawfully guarded,<br />
					already pledged to a husband<br />
					and protected by the rod,<br />
					even with girls crowned with the flower-garland (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br />
					or a company<br />
					or amid his relatives<br />
					or guild-men<br />
					or before the royal family<br />
					and asked to bear witness<br />
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, good fellow!<br />
					Say what you know."</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he knows not, he says, "I know";<br />
					though he knows, he says, "I know not";<br />
					though he has not seen, he says "I saw";<br />
					though he saw, he says "I saw not".</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br />
					or that of others<br />
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br />
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br />
					he proclaims it somewhere else<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					he repeats there<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br />
					foments strife between those discordant,<br />
					discord is his delight;<br />
					exulting in<br />
					and passionately fond of discord,<br />
					he utters speech<br />
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br />
					cutting,<br />
					bitter about others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					provoking wrath<br />
					and conducive to distraction -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br />
					he speaks out of season,<br />
					speaks unrealities;<br />
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br />
					what is not-dhamma<br />
					and not-discipline;<br />
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech unreasonable<br />
					and not worth listening to,<br />
					undiscriminating<br />
					and unconcerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is covetous,<br />
					he is one who covets the property of another,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"O that what is another's were mine!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br />
					the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let these beings be slain,<br />
					come to destruction,<br />
					be destroyed,<br />
					not exist at all."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br />
					he is perverse in outlook,<br />
					holding:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no gift,<br />
					no offering,<br />
					no sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done;<br />
					this world is not,<br />
					the world beyond is not;<br />
					there is no mother,<br />
					no father,<br />
					no beings supernaturally born;<br />
					there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br />
					who have gone right,<br />
					who fare rightly,<br />
					men who by their own comprehension<br />
					have realized this world<br />
					and the world beyond<br />
					and thus declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Characterized by these ten qualities<br />
					one is cast into purgatory according to his deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Characterized by ten qualities, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">What ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one abandons taking life,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					he has laid aside the rod,<br />
					has laid aside the knife;<br />
					he dwells modest,<br />
					charitable,<br />
					feeling compassion towards every living creature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons taking what is not given,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					the property of another,<br />
					situated in jungle or in village,<br />
					if not given,<br />
					he takes not with thievish intent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />

					even with girls crowned<br />
					with the flower-garlands (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons lying speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br />
					or a company<br />
					or amid his relatives<br />
					or guild-men<br />
					or before the royal family<br />

					<p class="f4">"Come, good fellow!<br />

					<p class="f4">If he knows not, he says, "I know not";<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at one place<br />

					what he has heard here<br />
					he does not report there<br />

					thus he brings together the discordant,<br />
					restores harmony,<br />
					harmony is his delight,<br />
					he exults in,<br />
					is passionately fond of harmony;<br />
					he utters speech that makes for harmony.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he abandons harsh speech,<br />
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					agreeable to many folk,<br />
					delightful to many folk,<br />
					of such speech he is a speaker.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also abandoning idle babble<br />
					he abstains therefrom;<br />
					he speaks in season,<br />
					of facts,<br />
					of the aim,<br />
					of dhamma,<br />
					of discipline;<br />
					he utters speech worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech seasonable<br />
					and worth listening to,<br />
					discriminating<br />
					and concerned with the aim.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not covetous;<br />
					he covets not the property of another,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"0 that what is another's were mine!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not malevolent of heart,<br />

					<p class="f4">He wishes:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let these beings carry about the self in peace,<br />
					free from enmity,<br />
					free from sorrow<br />
					and in happiness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has right view;<br />
					he is reasonable in outlook,<br />
					holding that there are such things as gift,<br />
					offering,<br />
					oblation,<br />
					fruit and ripening of deeds<br />
					done well or ill;<br />
					that this world is,<br />
					that the world beyond is;<br />
					that mother, father and beings of supernatural birth (in other worlds) do exist;<br />
