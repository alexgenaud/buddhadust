<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 75. Migasala confronts Ānanda in a huff because of her confusion over the fates of her father and uncle. Both were declared to have been reborn in the Tusita realm as Once-returners by the Buddha. Her father was proficient in ethical conduct but deficient in wisdom, her uncle proficient in wisdom but deficient in ethical behavior, but Migasala only sees one side: that her father was proficient in ethical behavior and her uncle was not; and she proceds to judge the Buddha and the Dhamma as flawed. Gotama explains the issue to Ānanda and gives five similar cases." />

					<p class="f4">A person is ruined, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">But I myself, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the knowledge of the destiny of others, Ānanda,<br />

					just a foolish, witless female woman,<br />
					with just a woman's wit -<br />
					and who are the individuals,<br />
					the male men who have the knowledge of the destiny of others?</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Ānanda, these ten persons are found existing in the world.</p>

							<p>Bhk. Bodhi [here and at AN 6.44] has made better sense of this than either Woodward or Hare:<br />
							<i>"...if Isidatta had possessed the same kind of virtuous behavior that Purāṇa had, Purāṇa could not have even known his destination. And if Purāṇa had possessed the same kind of wisdom that Isidatta had, Isidatta could not have even known his destination. In this way, Ānanda, these two persons were each deficient in one respect."</i><br />
							by "not even known his destination" is meant that had the deficient quality been present, that one would have become Arahant.</p>

I take <i>purisa-puggalā</i> as emphatic male as opposed to the other. <i>Paro-pariyañāṇa</i> is used of clairvoyant insight into others' conditions. Elsewhere <i>purisa-puggalā</i> <i>(par excellence)</i> are the eight sets of beings on the eight stages of the Fourfold Path <i>(yadidaṃ cattari purisa-yugāni aṭṭha purisa-puggalā, esa Bhagavato sāmka-sangho).</i> In this case the <i>purisa-puggalā</i> who knows is himself <i>(ahaṃ, yo vā mādiso).</i></p>

The reference is to <i>dhamma-savaṇa</i> just above. <i>Comy.</i> 'as he is a champion, it draws out (<i>nibbahati</i>) the knowledge-and-insight existing in him and makes him reach the Ariyan ground.' (However, for <i>soto</i> as <i>magga,</i> see <i>S.</i> v, 247;[?] <i>UdA.</i> 290; and <i>SA.</i> on <i>S.</i> ii, quoted above.)
