					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you dhamma-teaching,<br />
					dhamma-teaching on crookedness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay attention carefully and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> "We will, sir," replied those monks to the Exalted One,<br />
					who said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is dhamma-teaching which teaches about crookedness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, beings are responsible for their deeds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					heirs to their deeds,<br />
					they are the womb of their deeds,<br />
					kinsmen of their deeds,<br />
					to them their deeds come home again.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever deed they do,<br />
					be it lovely or ugly,<br />
					of that thing they are the heirs.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br />
					a certain one takes life,<br />
					he is a hunter,<br />
					bloody-handed,<br />
					given over to killing and slaying,<br />
					void of compassion to all living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes crookedly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> in body,<br />
					crookedly in speech,<br />
					crookedly in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">His action with body is crooked,<br />
					so is that with speech and mind;<br />
					crooked is his bourn<br />
					and crooked his rising up again in birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br />
					for one whose bourn is crooked,<br />
					whose rebirth is crooked,<br />
					for him there is one of two bourns,<br />
					either downright woe in purgatory<br />
					or to be born in the womb of an animal,<br />
					one that creeps crookedly along.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is that birth in the womb of an animal,<br />
					one that creeps crookedly along?</p>

					<p class="f4">A snake,<br />
					a scorpion,<br />
					a centipede,<br />
					a mongoose,<br />
					a cat,<br />
					a mouse,<br />
					an owl<br />
					or whatsoever other animal<br />
					goes stealthily on seeing human beings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">A certain one takes what is not given;<br />
					he takes with thievish intent<br />
					things not given to him,<br />
					the property of another person,<br />
					situated in jungle<br />
					or in village.</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />
					he is a wrong-doer;<br />
					he has intercourse with girls in ward of mother or father,<br />
					brother,<br />
					sister<br />
					or relatives (or clan);<br />
					with girls lawfully guarded,<br />
					already pledged to a husband<br />
					and protected by the rod,<br />
					even with girls crowned with the flower-garland (of betrothal).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">When cited to appear before the council<br />
					or a company<br />
					or amid his relatives<br />
					or guild-men<br />
					or before the royal family<br />
					and asked to bear witness<br />
					with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, good fellow!<br />
					Say what you know.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though he knows not, he says, 'I know';<br />
					though he knows, he says, 'I know not';<br />
					though he has not seen, he says 'I saw';<br />
					though he saw, he says 'I saw not'.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br />
					or that of others<br />
					or to get some carnal profit or other<br />
					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>
					<p class="f4">a slanderer,</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br />
					he proclaims it somewhere else<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties;<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					he repeats there<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony,<br />
					foments strife between those discordant,<br />
					discord is his delight;<br />
					exulting in<br />
					and passionately fond of discord,<br />
					he utters speech<br />
					that makes for discord.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is of harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is rough,<br />
					cutting,<br />
					bitter about others,<br />
					abusive of others,<br />
					provoking wrath<br />
					and conducive to distraction -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is given to idle babble,<br />
					he speaks out of season,<br />
					speaks unrealities;<br />
					he speaks things unprofitable,<br />
					what is not-dhamma<br />
					and not-discipline;<br />
					he utters speech not worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech unreasonable<br />
					and not worth listening to,<br />
					undiscriminating<br />
					and unconcerned with profit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is covetous,<br />
					he is one who covets the property of another,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'O that what is another's were mine!'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is malevolent of heart,<br />
					the thoughts of his heart are corrupt, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let these beings be slain,<br />
					come to destruction,<br />
					be destroyed,<br />
					not exist at all.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he has wrong view,<br />
					he is perverse in outlook,<br />
					holding:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no gift,<br />
					no offering,<br />
					no sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br />
					well done or ill done;<br />
					this world is not,<br />
					the world beyond is not;<br />
					there is no mother,<br />
					no father,<br />
					no beings supernaturally born;<br />
					there are no recluses and brāhmins in the world<br />
					who have gone right,<br />
					who fare rightly,<br />
					men who by their own comprehension<br />
					have realized this world<br />
					and the world beyond<br />
					and thus declare.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes crookedly in body,<br />
					crookedly in speech,<br />
					crookedly in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">His action with body is crooked,<br />
					so is that with speech and mind;<br />
					crooked is his bourn<br />
					and crooked his rising up again in birth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks,<br />
					for one whose bourn is crooked,<br />
					whose rebirth is crooked,<br />
					for him there is one of two bourns,<br />
					either downright woe in purgatory<br />
					or to be born in the womb of an animal,<br />
					one that creeps crookedly along.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is that birth in the womb of an animal,<br />
					one that creeps crookedly along?</p>

					<p class="f4">A snake,<br />
					a scorpion,<br />

					<a id="pg188"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></a> a cat,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, beings are responsible for their deeds,<br />
					heirs to their deeds,<br />
					the womb of their deeds,<br />
					the kinsmen of their deeds,<br />
					to them their deeds come home again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever deed they do,<br />
					be it lovely or ugly,<br />
					of that they are the heirs.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one abandons taking life,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					he has laid aside the rod,<br />
					has laid aside the knife;<br />
					he dwells modest,<br />
					charitable,<br />
					feeling compassion towards every living creature.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes not crookedly in body,<br />
					speech and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">His action with body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and mind is straight;<br />
					straightforward is his bourn<br />
					and straight his rebirth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, for one whose bourn and rebirth are straight<br />
					I declare one of two bourns,<br />
					either those heaven-worlds<br />

					or (rebirth in) whatsoever families are exalted,<br />
					such as the families of nobles<br />
					or brāhmins,<br />

					wealthy,<br />
					of great resources,<br />
					of great property,<br />
					with great store of gold and silver,<br />
					with great store of possessions,<br />
					with great store of wealth and grain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus become, monks,<br />
					is the rebirth of one who has come to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he does,<br />
					by that he is reborn;<br />
					when reborn (appropriate) contacts<br />
					contact such an one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I declare that beings are the heirs of their deeds.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons taking what is not given,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					the property of another,<br />

					he takes not with thievish intent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In sexual desires<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech<br />

					thus he brings together the discordant,<br />
					restores harmony,<br />
					harmony is his delight,<br />
					he exults in,<br />
					is passionately fond of harmony;<br />
					he utters speech that makes for harmony.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he abandons harsh speech,<br />
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is blameless,<br />
					pleasant to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					going to the heart,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					agreeable to many folk,<br />
					delightful to many folk,<br />
					of such speech he is a speaker.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also abandoning idle babble<br />
					he abstains therefrom;<br />
					he speaks in season,<br />
					of facts,<br />
					of the aim,<br />
					of dhamma,<br />
					of discipline;<br />
					he utters speech worth treasuring up,<br />
					speech seasonable<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not covetous;<br />
