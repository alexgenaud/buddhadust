					<p class="f4">The Wanderer Uttiya came to see the Exalted One,<br />

					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the Wanderer Uttiya said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) "Pray, Master Gotama, is the world eternal?<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) "Pray, Master Gotama, is a wayfarer (man) beyond death<br />

					<p class="f4">"I have not declared, Uttiya:<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"With full comprehension, Uttiya,<br />
					I teach Dhamma to disciples<br />
					for the purification of beings,<br />
					for the overpassing of sorrow and despair,<br />
					for the going to an end of grief and dejection,<br />
					for reaching the Method,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the realizing of Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"If then with full comprehension<br />
					the worthy Gotama teaches dhamma to disciples<br />
					for the purification of beings,<br />
					for the overpassing of sorrow and despair,<br />
					for the going to an end of grief and dejection,<br />
					for reaching the Method,<br />
					for the realizing of Nibbāna,<br />
					pray, will the whole world escape<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> thereby<br />
					or only half of it<br />
					or one third part of it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One was silent.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> Then it occurred to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Wanderer Uttiya must not be allowed to entertain the harmful view<br />
					that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Gotama the recluse,<br />
					when asked by him an all-important question,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					let it drop.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Can it be that he cannot answer it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a view would be loss and sorrow<br />
					for a long time<br />
					to the Wanderer Uttiya."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Ānanda said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"See now, Uttiya, your reverence,<br />
					I will make a figure for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a figure sometimes intelligent people understand the meaning of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a border-town of some rājah,<br />
					with strong foundations,<br />
					strong walls and towers,<br />
					but a single gate;<br />
					and over that gate is set a warden,<br />
					shrewd and watchful,<br />
					who keeps out strangers<br />
					and lets in known people.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he patrols all round that town in due order<br />
					he might not mark a crevice in the wall<br />
					or a hole big enough for a cat to slip through,<br />
					nor would he have the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So many creatures enter<br />
					or so many creatures leave this town.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But this he would know:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever creatures of any size<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					enter or leave this town,<br />
					all of them enter or leave by this gate.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, your reverence<br />
					(that question of yours, namely):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Will the whole world escape thereby<br />
					or half of it<br />
					or one third part of it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">is not a matter of urgent importance to the Wayfarer.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">What he says is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whosoever have escaped,<br />
					are escaping<br />
					or will escape from the world,<br />
					all of them,<br />
					by abandoning the five hindrances,<br />
					those defilements of the heart<br />
					which cause the weakening of insight -<br />
					all of them<br />
					with thoughts well established in the four arisings of mindfulness,<br />
					by making to grow in very truth the seven limbs of wisdom -<br />
					all of them have escaped,<br />
					are escaping<br />
					or will escape by so doing.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So as to that question of yours which <a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> you put to the Exalted One,<br />
					you asked it from a different point of view.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is why the Exalted One did not explain the matter to you."</p>
