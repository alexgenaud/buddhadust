					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Monks, these seven limbs of wisdom,<br />
					if made to grow,<br />
					if made much of,<br />
					complete the threefold knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br />
					the limb of wisdom which is investigation of Dhamma,<br />
					the limb of wisdom which is energy,<br />
					the limb of wisdom which is zest,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the limb of wisdom which is tranquillity,<br />
					the limb of wisdom which is concentration,<br />
					and the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven complete the threefold knowledge.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What is that?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> In this connexion a monk recalls his manifold former dwelling,<br />
					for instance:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three, four, five,<br />
					even ten births,<br />
					twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births;<br />
					even a hundred births,<br />
					a thousand, a hundred thousand births.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise the divers folding up of aeons,<br />
					the divers unfolding of aeons,<br />
					the divers folding-unfolding of aeons.</p>

					<p class="f4">(remembering):</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time I had such a name,<br />
					was of such a family,<br />
					of such complexion,<br />
					was thus supported,<br />
					thus and thus experienced weal and woe,<br />
					had such and such span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">As that one,<br />
					I deceasing thence<br />
					rose up again at that time;<br />
					then too I had such a name,<br />
					was of such a family,<br />
					of such complexion,<br />
					was thus supported,<br />
					thus and thus experienced weal and woe,<br />
					had such and such span of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">As that one,<br />
					I deceasing thence rose up again here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with all details and characteristics<br />
					he recalls his manifold former dwellings.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					he beholds beings deceasing<br />
					and rising up again;<br />
					beings both mean and excellent,<br />
					fair and foul,<br />
					gone to a happy bourn,<br />
					gone to an ill-bourn<br />
					according to their deeds<br />
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">Alas, sirs, these beings,<br />
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br />
					of evil words,<br />
					of evil thoughts,<br />
					scoffing at the Ariyans,<br />
					of perverted view<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their perverted view -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					when body broke up,<br />
					beyond death rose up again in the Waste,<br />
					the Ill-bourn,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					in Purgatory!</p>

					<p class="f4">Or:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah, sirs, these beings,<br />
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br />
					of good words,<br />
					of good thoughts,<br />
					no scoffers at the Ariyans,<br />
					but of sound view<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their sound view -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					when body broke up,<br />
					beyond death rose up again in the Happy Bourn<br />
					in the heaven world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					beholds beings deceasing<br />
					and rising up again;<br />
					beings both mean and excellent,<br />
					fair and foul,<br />
					gone to a happy bourn,<br />
					gone to an ill-bourn<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">By the destruction of the cankers,<br />
					in this same visible state<br />
					he attains the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					that is freed of the cankers,<br />
					himself thoroughly comprehending it,<br />
					and realizing it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these seven limbs of wisdom, monks, complete this threefold knowledge.'</p>
