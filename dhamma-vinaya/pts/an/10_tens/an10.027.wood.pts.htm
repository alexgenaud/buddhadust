Some bhikkhus are asked that since both they and the Buddha teach a goal of understanding all things, what is the difference between the two systems.

					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					set out for Sāvatthī<br />
					questing for alms-food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it occurred to those monks thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It is full early yet to range Sāvatthī for alms-food.<br />
					Suppose we visit the park of the Wanderers holding other views."</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly they did so,<br />
					<a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a>  and on getting there greeted them courteously, and,<br />
					after the exchange of greetings and reminiscent talk,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So seated those Wanderers of other views said this to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverences, Gotama the recluse thus teaches dhamma:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Come ye, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, your reverences,<br />

					but without expressing either approval or disapproval<br />
					they rose up and went away, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"We will learn the meaning of this saying<br />
					in the company of the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So those monks,<br />
					after ranging Sāvatthī for alms-food,<br />
					on returning from their alms-round<br />
					and after eating their meal,<br />
					went tosee the Exalted One,<br />
