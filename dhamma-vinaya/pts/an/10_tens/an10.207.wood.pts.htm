					though he knows, he says 'I know not';<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus for his own sake<br />

					he deliberately utters falsehood.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is a slanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing something at one place<br />
					he proclaims it at another place<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">What he has heard here<br />
					he repeats there<br />
					to bring about a quarrel between the parties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he breaks up harmony<br />
					and foments strife<br />
					between those discordant;<br />
					discord is his delight;<br />
					exulting in discord,<br />
					passionately fond of discord<br />

					what is not-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">He utters words not worth treasuring up,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one is covetous,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he has wrong view,<br />

					no sacrifice;<br />
					there is no fruit or ripening of deeds<br />
					ill done or well done;<br />
					this world is not;<br />
					the world beyond is not;<br />
					there is no mother or father<br />
