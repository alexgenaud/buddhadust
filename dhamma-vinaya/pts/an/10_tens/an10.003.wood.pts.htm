<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Tens, Sutta 3. The Buddha explains, in a Paticca-Samuppada-like sutta, how each step from ethical conduct to freedom from regret, joy, entheusiasm, calm, happiness, serenity, knowing and seeing things as they are, disgust with things as they are, and knowing and seeing freedom depends on the previous condition." />
