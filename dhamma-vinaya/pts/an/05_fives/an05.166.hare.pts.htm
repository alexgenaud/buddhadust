					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Why thinkest thou, Udāyin,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the Venerable Ānanda thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it possible,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Verily, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Herein, monks, a monk,<br />
					who has achieved virtue,<br />
					achieved concentration,<br />
					achieved insight,<br />
					may both completely enter<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One;<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Just now, venerable Upavāna,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore wonder not, venerable sir,<br />

					bring<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> the matter up<br />
					and<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> relate the whole affair<br />

					<p class="f4">Already even fearfulness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> is come upon us.'</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And in the evening,<br />

					and, when come, he sat down on <a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> the seat that was ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the venerable Upavāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Having how many qualities, Upavāna,<br />
					does an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br />
					become pious,<br />
					loved,<br />
					respected<br />
					and what he ought to become?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, having five<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> qualities,<br />
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br />
					becomes pious,<br />
					loved,<br />
					respected<br />
					and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, herein he is virtuous,<br />
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br />
					is perfect in conduct and habit,<br />
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br />
					accepts the training<br />
					and trains himself accordantly;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">he is learned,<br />
					with mind retentive and well stored;<br />
					those things lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely in the end,<br />
					which set forth in spirit and in letter<br />
					the godly life of purity,<br />
					perfect in its entirety —<br />
					those are fully learnt by him,<br />
					resolved upon,<br />
					made familiar by speech,<br />
					pondered over in the mind,<br />
					fully understood in theory.;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">he has a pleasant voice,<br />
					a good enunciation,<br />
					is urbane in speech,<br />
					distinct,<br />
					free from hoarseness<br />
					and informative;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">at will,<br />
					easily and without trouble,<br />
					he attains to the four states of musing,<br />
					which bring comfort<br />
					both here and now,<br />
					transcending thought;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">by destroying the cankcrs<br />
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart<br />
					and of insight,<br />
					which is free of the cankers,<br />
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br />
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, lord, having these five qualities<br />
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br />
					becomes pious,<br />
					loved,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well (said), well (said), Upavāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is even (as you say): having these five qualities<br />
					an elder among his fellows in the godly life<br />
					becomes pious,<br />
					loved,<br />
					respected<br />
					and what he oughtght to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these five qualities are not completely found in an elder,<br />
					will his fellows in the godly life respect,<br />
					honour,<br />

					his wrinkled skin?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But verily, Upavāna, when these five things are found in an elder,<br />
