The Buddha describes how the development and making a big thing of the idea of impermanence, the idea of pain in impermanence, the idea of not-self in pain, the idea of giving up, and the idea of dispassion have their fruition in freedom of heart and the advantages of freedom of heart and freedom of wisdom and the advantages of freedom of wisdom." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things,<br />
					when made become,<br />
					made an increase in,<br />
					have as their fruits<br />
					mind-emancipation<br />
					and the advantages thereof,<br />
					insight-emancipation<br />
					and the advantages thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought of impermanence,<br />
					the thought of ill in impermanence,<br />
					the thought of no-self in ill,<br />
					the thought of renunciation,<br />
					and the thought of dispassion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these five things,<br />

					made an increase in,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, when indeed a monk is both<br />
					mind-emancipated<br />
					and insight-emancipated,<br />
					that monk is said to have lifted the barrier,<br />
					filled in the moat,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein by the monk<br />

					cut down to the roots,<br />
					made as a palm-tree stump,<br />
