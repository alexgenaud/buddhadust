Sumanā, Raja Pasanadi's sister, has waited a long time to join the order as she first felt the need to take care of her grandmother.

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br />
					and there Sumanā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the rajah's daughter,<br />
					with a following of five hundred royal maidens<br />
					in five hundred chariots,<br />
					came and visited him; and,<br />
					after saluting,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, she spoke thus to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, suppose two of the Blessed One's disciples<br />
					were alike in faith,<br />
					alike in virtue<br />
					and alike in insight,<br />
					but one was an alms-giver<br />
					and the other was not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both, on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					would be reborn in the happy heaven world;<br />
					but among the devas, lord,<br />
					would there be a distinction,<br />
					a difference,<br />
					between them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There would be, Sumanā,'<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The alms-giver,<br />
					when come to deva-state,<br />
					surpasses the non-giver<br />
					in five ways:<br />
					in divine life-span,<br />
					beauty,<br />
					happiness,<br />
					honour<br />
					and power.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br />
					the alms-giver,<br />
					when come to deva-state,<br />
					surpasses the non-giver.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'But if, lord,<br />
					faring on thence,<br />
					they should return to this state here;<br />
					when become human, lord,<br />
					would there be a distinction,<br />
					a difference,<br />
					between them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There would be, Sumanā,'<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The alms-giver,<br />
					as man,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'But if both, lord,<br />
					were to go forth from the home<br />
					into the <a id="pg25"><span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span></a> homeless life;<br />
					when gone forth, lord,<br />
					would there be a distinction,<br />
					a difference,<br />
					between them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'There would be, Sumanā,'<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The alms-giver,<br />
					when gone forth,<br />

					he is often asked to accept a robe,<br />
					he is not rarely asked;<br />
					often to accept alms,<br />
					not rarely;<br />
					often to accept a lodging,<br />
					not rarely;<br />
					often to accept medicaments for sickness,<br />
					not rarely;<br />
					with whomsoever he dwells<br />
					in leading the godly life,<br />
					such folk mostly act towards him with cordiality<br />
					in their ways of living,<br />
					talking<br />
					and thinking;<br />
					it is rare for them no to act cordially,<br />

					seldom without cordiality.</p>

					<p class="f4">In these five ways, Sumanā,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'But, lord, if both win arahantship;<br />
					in that state<br />
					would there be a distinction,<br />
					a difference,<br />
					between them?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In that case, Sumanā, I verily declare<br />
					there is no difference whatsoever,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					comparing emancipation<br />
					with emancipation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is amazing, lord,<br />
					it is wonderful, lord,<br />
					how far-reaching is the effect of giving alms<br />
					and doing good deeds,<br />
					since they are a help<br />
					and a boon to one<br />
					as a deva,<br />
					a help and a boon to one<br />
					as a man,<br />
					yea, a help and a boon<br />
					when one has gone forth!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is even so, Sumanā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">51</a>]</sup></span><br />
					far-reaching is the effect of giving alms<br />
					and doing good deeds,<br />
					since they are a help<br />
					and a boon to one<br />
					as a deva,<br />
					a help and a boon to one<br />
					as a man,<br />
					yea, a help and a boon<br />
					when one has gone forth!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Exalted One;<br />
					and when the Well-gone had thus spoken,<br />
					the Master spoke again and said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'As<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> stainless on her sky-bound course, the moon<br />
							Outshines in splendour all the stars' array:<br />
							Just so the virtuous, believing man<br />
							In charity outshines the mean on earth.<br />
							Ev'n<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> as the hundred cloud-peaked thunder-storm,<br />
