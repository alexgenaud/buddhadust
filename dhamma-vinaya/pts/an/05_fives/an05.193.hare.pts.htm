<meta name="description" content="The E.M. Hare translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya, Fives, Sutta 193. Brahman Sangarava asks Gotama why it is that sometimes suttas are easily recollected and sometimes not. The Buddha explains that when the mind is clouded over with lust, anger, sloth, fear and doubt, things cannot easily be remembered, but when the mind is clear of lust, anger, sloth, fear and doubt things are easily remembered." />
