					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#bhaddiya">Bhaddiya</a><br />
					in Jātiya Wood;<br />
					and there Uggaha, Meṇḍaka's grandson,<br />
					paid him a visit and,<br />
					after saluting,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One accept a meal at my house tomorrow,<br />
					he as fourth (with us three).'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg29"><span class="f2 g"><b>[29]</b></span></a> The Exalted One accepted by his silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Uggaha, Meṇḍaka's grandson,<br />
					seeing the Exalted One had accepted,<br />
					rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted,<br />
					and took his leave;<br />
					keeping the Exalted One on his right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the night was over,<br />
					the Exalted One, robing himself in the morning,<br />
					took bowl and cloak<br />
					and went to Uggaha's house,<br />
					and there sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Uggaha, Meṇḍaka's grandson,<br />
					served and satisfied the Exalted One by hand<br />
					with plenty of hard and soft food<br />
					and when the Exalted One had removed his hand from his bowl,<br />
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these girls of mine<br />
					will be going to their husbands' families;<br />
					lord, let the Exalted One counsel them,<br />
					let the Exalted One advise them,<br />
					for their good and happiness<br />
					for many a day!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One spoke to them and said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>Wherefore, girls, train yourselves in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">To whatsoever husband our parents shall give us —<br />
					wishing our weal,<br />
					seeking our happiness,<br />
					compassionate,<br />
					because of compassion —<br />
					for him we will rise up early,<br />
					be the last to retire,<br />
					be willing workers,<br />
					order all things sweetly<br />
					and be gentle voiced.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will honour,<br />
					revere,<br />
					esteem<br />
					and respect<br />
					all whom our husband reveres,<br />
					whether mother or father,<br />
					recluse or godly man,<br />
					and on their arrival<br />
					will offer them a seat and water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">We will be deft and nimble<br />
					at our husband's home-crafts,<br />
					whether they be of wool or <a id="pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> cotton,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					making it our business to understand the work,<br />
					so as to do and get it done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever our husband's household consist of —<br />
					slaves, messengers and workfolk —<br />
					we will know the work of each<br />
					by what has been done,<br />
					their remissness<br />
					by what has not been done;<br />
					we will know the strength and the weakness of the sick;<br />
					we will divide the hard and soft food,<br />
					each<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> according to his share.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in this way also, girls:</p>

					<p class="f4">The money,<br />
					corn,<br />
					silver<br />
					and gold<br />
					that our husband brings home,<br />
					we will keep safe watch and ward over it,<br />
					and act as no robber,<br />
					thief,<br />
					carouser,<br />
					wastrel<br />
					therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves thus, girls.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, girls,<br />
					possessed of these five qualities,<br />
					women, on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					are reborn among the devas of lovely form.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Active,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> alert to cherish him alway,<br />
							Not to that man who brings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> her every joy<br />
							She offers slight; nor will a good wife<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> move<br />
							To wrath her husband by some spiteful word;<br />
							And she reveres all whom her husband honours,<br />
							For she is wise. Deft, nimble, up betimes,<br />
							She minds his wealth amid his folk<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> at work<br />
							And sweetly orders all. A wife like this,<br />
							Who with her husband's wish and will complies,<br />
							Is born again where lovely devas dwell.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Mendaka (the ram) was a fabulously rich man with magic powers, which his household were also supposed to possess (see <i>Vin.</i> i, 240; Warren, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-100.htm"><i>B. in T.</i> 448</a>); he fed the B. and Order on a journey, after which travelling rations were allowed. Reference is made to him and his family at <i>Vism. trsl.</i> 443 (see note 1, p. 444; the stories, with less exaggeration, are told at <i>Vin. loc. cit.</i>); <i>UdA.</i> 158; <i>DhpA.:</i> <i>Visākhāyā vatthu</i> (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-101.htm">Warren, op. cit., 451</a>). His granddaughter was Visākhā (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/006.single.verses.htm#XIII">Sisters, p. 16</a>). The family lived at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#bhaddiya">Bhaddiya</a> (our <i>Comy.</i> <i>-ike</i>) — according to Warren, in Bengal, but probably Magadha, since Bimbisāra sent his minister to witness M.'s magic (<i>Vin.</i>). I cannot trace Uggaha elsewhere, our  <i>Comy.</i> is silent. Of Jātiyāvana, <i>Comy.</i> observes that the forest was one continuous stretch up the slope of the Himālayas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Atta-catuttho;</i> <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg393"><i>M.</i> I, 393,</a>  <i>Comy.</i>  says he did so fearing his girls would be nervous <i>(olīnamānā)</i> among the monks and not able to take in the Buddha's words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These five and the <i>gāthā</i> recur at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.046.pali.bd.htm#pg265"><i>A.</i> iv, 265.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> At <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.17.pali.bd.htm#pg175"><i>D.</i> ii, 175</a> these terms are applied to the ideal woman, <i>itthiratana;</i> at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.02.pali.bd.htm#pg60">D. i, 60,</a> [<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.02.rhyt.pts.htm#p35">DN 17 § 35</a>] <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.084.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><i>M.</i> ii, 84,</a> [<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.084.horn.pts.htm#pg274">MN 84</a>] <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/03_kv/sn03.22.085.pali.bd.htm#PG113"><i>S.</i> iii, 113</a> [<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p85">SN.22.85</a>] to a servant or a slave; see <i>D.A.</i> i, 168. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Brihaspati Smriti,</i> xxiv, 6 (<i>S.B.E.</i> xxxiii, 368); 'Rising before others, paying reverence to the elders of the family, preparing food and condiments and using a low seat and bed — thus have the duties of women been declared.' Also <i>Proverbs</i> xxxi: 'She riseth while it is yet night ... she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands ... she looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Of the former <i>Comy.</i> observes: Combing, washing, dyeing, plaiting, working, etc., goat's hair; of the latter: ginning <i>(vaṭṭana); piñjana,</i> ?carding, lit.: painting, in <i>Sk.</i> also to bleach; <i>phoṭana,</i> ? spinning, lit. either to boil or shake; <i>kantana,</i> weaving, more generally spinning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i> with <i>v.l.</i> reads <i>c'assa,</i> as at <i>A.</i> iv.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> I take <i>yo</i> to refer to <i>mātugāmo.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Parijjanā:</i> doubling the <i>'j'</i> is no doubt for the sake of the metre, and this spelling has crept into the prose version at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.049.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> iv, 269;</a> see <i>P.E.D.</i> <i>s.v.</i></p>
