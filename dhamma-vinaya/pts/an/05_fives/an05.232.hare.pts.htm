					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br />
					follow the course of five things,<br />
					he becomes among his fellows in the godly life<br />
					pious <a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> and pleasing,<br />
					respected<br />
					and what he ought to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He becomes virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					abides restrained by the restraint of the Obligations,<br />
					is perfect in conduct and habit,<br />
					sees peril in the smallest fault,<br />
					accepts the training<br />
					and trains himself accordantly.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is learned,<br />
					with mind retentive and well stored;<br />
					those things lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely in the end,<br />
					which set forth in spirit and in letter<br />
					the godly life of purity,<br />
					perfect in its entirety —<br />
					those are fully learnt by him,<br />
					resolved upon,<br />
					made familiar by speech,<br />
					pondered over in the mind,<br />
					fully understood in theory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He has a pleasant voice,<br />
					a good enunciation,<br />
					is urbane in speech,<br />
					distinct,<br />
					free from hoarseness<br />
					and informative.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At will,<br />
					easily and without trouble,<br />
					he attains to the four states of musing,<br />
					which bring comfort<br />
					both here and now,<br />
					transcending thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the cankcrs<br />
					he enters and abides in the emancipation of the heart<br />
					and of insight,<br />
					which is free of the cankers,<br />
					and this state he knows and realizes for himself,<br />
					even in this life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks,if a monk in residence<br />
					follow the course of five things,<br />
					he becomes among his fellows in the godly life<br />
					pious and pleasing,<br />
					respected<br />
					and what he ought to become.'</p>
