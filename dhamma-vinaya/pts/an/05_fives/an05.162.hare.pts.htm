					<p class="f4">Now of him whose ways are impure in deed,<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose, sirs, a monk, who robes himself in dust-heap rags,<br />
					were to see a rag in the carriage-way;<br />
					he would hold on<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to it with his left foot<br />
					and spread it out with his right<br />
					and take<br />
					and make use<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> of the best of it<br />

					<p class="f4">Just so, sirs,<br />
					of one whose ways are impure in deed,<br />

					the ways of deeds that may be impure<br />
					ought not at that time to be thought on;<br />

					but pure in deed —<br />
					how in him<br />
					ought malice to be put away?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, sirs, a man, tortured by heat,<br />
					by heat forspent,<br />
					wearied,<br />
					craving<br />
					and thirsty,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> were to come to a pond<br />

					<p class="f4">Just so, sirs,<br />

					the ways of words<br />
					that may be impure<br />
					ought not then to be thought on;<br />
					let him think then<br />
					on the ways that may be pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, sirs, a man,<br />
					tortured by heat,<br />

					wearied,<br />

					were to come upon a puddle<br />
					in a cow's footprint;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he might think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here's a cow's footprint puddle,<br />

					I shall stir and churn<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> it up<br />

					<p class="f4">Just so, sirs, of one whose ways are impure,<br />
					who obtains no mental clarity,<br />

					so that he say to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Alas for this venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">He should <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> give up bad habits in deed<br />

					<p class="f4">In this way in him<br />
