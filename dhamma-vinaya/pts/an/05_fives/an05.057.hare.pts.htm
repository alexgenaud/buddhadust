<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fives, Sutta 57. The Buddha urges everyone interested in their own salvation to give contemplation to aging, being subject to sickness and death, changeability and separation from the things we love, and the idea that one's deeds return to one in kind. He further explains why it is important to think of these things and the way to think of these things that will bring about escape from them." />
