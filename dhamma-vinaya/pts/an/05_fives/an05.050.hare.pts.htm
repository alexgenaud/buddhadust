					<p class="f4">One time the venerable Nārada<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> dwelt near Pāṭaliputta,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the Cock's Park.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Bhaddā, the dear and beloved ranee of rajah Muṇḍa,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> died;<br />
					and because of the loss of his dear ranee, Bhaddā,<br />
					he neither bathed,<br />
					nor anointed himself,<br />
					nor partook of any food,<br />
					nor concerned himself with any affairs,<br />
					but day and night<br />
					clung in grief to her body<br />
					as though a-swoon.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">After a while he summoned his treasurer, Piyaka,<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Prythee, friend Piyaka,<br />
					place the body of the ranee, Bhaddā,<br />
					in an oil vessel made of iron<br />
					and cover it over with another iron vessel,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					so that we shall see her body longer.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire,' Hyaka replied,<br />
					and he placed the body of the ranee, Bhaddā,<br />
					in an oil vessel made of iron<br />
					and covered it over with another iron vessel.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Piyaka, the treasurer, thought to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhaddā,<br />
					the dear, beloved ranee of rajah Muṇḍa, is dead;<br />
					and because of this <a id="pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> loss,<br />
					the rajah not even bathes<br />
					or anoints himself,<br />
					nor eats food,<br />
					nor concerns himself with his affairs,<br />
					but clings in grief to her body<br />
					as though a-swoon.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What if rajah Muṇḍa go<br />
					and wait upon some recluse or godly man!</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had learnt Dhamma,<br />
					he would pluck out the dart of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And again he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Near Pāṭaliputta,<br />
					in the Cock's Park,<br />
					dwells this venerable Nārada;<br />
					and of that same reverend sir<br />
					this fair report is gone abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A sage is he,<br />
					accomplished,<br />
					wise,<br />
					learned,<br />
					an able speaker,<br />
					of ready, gracious wit,<br />
					both venerable<br />
					and arahant.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Methinks, if rajah Muṇḍa were to go and wait upon the venerable Nārada,<br />
					perhaps, after listening to the venerable one's Dhamma,<br />
					he would pluck out the dart of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So Piyaka, the treasurer,<br />
					approached the rajah and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, this venerable Nārada dwells hard by Pāṭaliputta,<br />
					in the Cock's Park;<br />
					now of him a fair report has gone abroad,<br />
					that he is a sage,<br />
					accomplished,<br />
					wise,<br />
					learned,<br />
					an able speaker,<br />
					of ready, gracious wit,<br />
					both venerable<br />
					and arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if my lord were to go and wait upon the venerable one,<br />
					he could,<br />
					after listening to the venerable Nārada's Dhamma,<br />
					pluck out the dart of sorrow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, friend Piyaka,<br />
					announce (my coming) to the venerable Nārada.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">How, I wonder,<br />
					ought one like me<br />
					to approach a recluse or godly man,<br />
					previously unknown,<br />
					dwelling in the kingdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire,' he replied;<br />
					and Piyaka, the treasurer,<br />
					went and visited the venerable Nārada<br />
					and saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					he spoke thus to the venerable one:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir, Bhaddā, the dear and beloved ranee of rajah has died;<br />
					and because of his loss<br />
					the rajah neither bathes<br />
					nor anoints himself,<br />
					,<br />
					nor eats food,<br />
					nor concerns himself with his affairs,<br />
					but <a id="pg50"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span></a> clings in grief to her body<br />
					as though a-swoon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good it were, reverend sir,<br />
					if the venerable Nārada were to teach such Dhamma<br />
					that rajah Muṇḍa, having heard,<br />
					might pluck out the dart of sorrow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now is the time, Piyaka,<br />
					for the rajah Muṇḍa to do as he thinks fit.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Piyaka, the treasurer, got up from his seat,<br />
					saluted the venerable Nārada<br />
					and took his leave,<br />
					keeping the venerable one on his right;<br />
					and approaching the rajah,<br />
					he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, I have made occasion with the venefable Nārada;<br />
					sire, now is the time to do as you think fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, friend Piyaka,<br />
					have our state carriages got ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, sire,' he replied;<br />
					and when he had done so,<br />
					he told the rajah:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sire, the state carriages await you.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then rajah Muṇḍa got up into a state carriage<br />
					and with many others<br />
					went off in royal pomp and power<br />
					to see the venerable Nārada<br />
					at the Cock's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having gone by carriage as far as the ground allowed,<br />
					he got down and entered the Park on foot.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the rajah Muṇḍa approached the venerable Nārada,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side;<br />
					and the venerable Nārada spoke thus to him,<br />
					so seated:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are, Maharajah, five states not to be got to<br />
