					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you how to make become<br />

					Ariyan right concentration;<br />
					listen attentively and pay heed and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, lord,' they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> take the case of a monk, who,<br />
					aloof from sensuous appetites,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of joy and ease;<br />
					he steeps<br />
					<a id="pg18"><span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span></a> and drenches<br />
					and fills<br />
					and suffuses this body<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with a zest and ease,<br />

					that is not pervaded<br />
					by this lone-born zest and ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as a handy bathman<br />
					or attendant<br />
					might strew bath-powder<br />
					in some copper basin<br />
					and, gradually sprinkling water,<br />
					knead it together<br />
					so that the bath-ball gathered up the moisture,<br />
					became enveloped in moisture<br />
					and saturated both in and out,<br />
					but did not ooze moisture;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so a monk steeps,<br />
					drenches,<br />

					born of solitude,<br />
					so that there is not one particle of the body<br />
					that is not pervaded<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is firstly how to make become<br />
					the five-limbed Ariyan right concentration.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or a monk, suppressing applied and sustained thought,<br />
					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of zest and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed;<br />
					he steeps<br />
					and drenches<br />
					and fills<br />
					and suffuses this body<br />
					with joy and ease<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					so that there is not one particle of the body<br />
					that is not pervaded<br />
					by this zest and ease<br />
					born of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, imagine a pool with a spring,<br />
					but no water-inlet<br />
					either on the east side<br />
					or on the west<br />
					or on the north<br />
					or on the south,<br />
					and suppose the (rain-) deva<br />
					supply not proper rains from time to time —<br />
					cool waters would still well up from that pool,<br />
					and that pool would be<br />
					steeped,<br />
					drenched,<br />
					filled<br />
					and suffused<br />
					with the cold water<br />
					so that not a drop but would be pervaded<br />
					by the cold water;<br />
					in just the same way, monks,<br />
					a monk steeps<br />
					drenches,<br />
					fills<br />
					and suffuses<br />
					his body with zest and ease<br />
					born of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is secondly how<br />
					to make become the five-limbed Ariyan right concentration.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, a monk, free from the fervour of zest,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br />
					'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease;<br />. . .
					he steeps<br />
					and drenches<br />
					and fills<br />
					and suffuses<br />
					this body with a zestless ease<br />
					so that there is not one particle of the body<br />
					that is not pervaded by this zestless ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as in a pond of blue,<br />

					and red water-lilies,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the plants are born in water,<br />

					come not <a id="pg19"><span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></a> out of the water,<br />
					but, sunk in the depths,<br />
					find nourishment,<br />
					and from tip to root<br />
					are steeped,<br />
					drenched,<br />
					filled<br />
					and suffused<br />
					with cold water<br />
					so that not a part of them<br />
					is not pervaded by cold water;<br />
					even so, monks, a monk steeps<br />
					and drenches<br />
					and fills<br />
					and suffuses<br />
					his body in zestless ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is thirdly how to make become<br />
					the five-limbed Ariyan right concentration.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, a monk, putting away ease<br />
					and by putting away ill,<br />
					by the passing away of happiness and misery<br />
					he was wont to feel,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					which is utter purity of mindfulness,<br />
					which comes of disinterestedness<br />
					and is free of ease and ill;<br />
					seated,<br />
					he suffuses his body<br />
					with purity by the pureness of his mind<br />
					so that there is not one partide of the body<br />
					that is not pervaded with purity<br />
					by the pureness of his mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as a man might sit<br />

					so that not a portion of it<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as someone might survey another,<br />
