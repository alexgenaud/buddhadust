An elder of their clan is astounded and remarks as to how they will become like a neighbouring clan of gentle manners. The Buddha then, within earshot of the youths, teaches him about the advantages of paying reverance to mother and father, wife and children, workers, gods and holy men." />

					<p class="f4">At one time the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Veaālī,</a><br />
					at the Cabled Hall,<br />
					in Mahāvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">And early one morning,<br />
					after dressing,<br />
					the Exalted One took bowl and robe<br />
					and entered Veaālī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And having gone his round,<br />
					on his return,<br />
					after the midday meal,<br />
					he made his way into the great forest of Mahāvana,<br />
					and sat down for the noonday rest<br />
					at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a company, of Lacchavi young men<br />
					were out stalking and ranging in Mahāvana;<br />
					they had their bows strung<br />
					and were surrounded by a pack of dogs;<br />
					and they saw the Exalted One<br />
					seated at the foot of the tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at that sight<br />
					they cast aside their bows,<br />
					called off their dogs<br />
					and approached the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and stood with hands upraised<br />
					in silence reverencing him.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then Mahānāma,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Licchavi,<br />
					was stretching his legs in Mahāvana<br />
					by walking up and down;<br />
					and he saw those young Licchavis<br />
					with upraised hands<br />
					silently reverencing the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Mahānāma, the Licchavi,<br />
					went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he salid with bated breath:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'They will become Vajjians,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they will become Vajjians!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But why, Mahānāma, dost thou speak so:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They will become Vajjians!"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these Licchavi young men<br />
					are quick-tempered,<br />
					rough,<br />
					greedy fellows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such presents as are sent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> by clanfolk —<br />

					they slap the women and the girls of the clan on the back.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such are these fellows<br />
					who now with upraised hands<br />
					stand in silence reverencing the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Wheresoever these five conditions are found, Mahānāma,<br />

It is possible that we have a name substituted, when <i>written</i> suttas involved many blurred words, for the forgotten name of a disciple. Rhys Davids lists Licchavis and Videhas as forming two branches of one Vajjian confederacy, but this sutta points to Licchavis as <i>not</i> Vajjians, a more cultured oligarchy. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.16.rhyt.pts.htm#pg79"><i>Dial.</i> ii, p. 79ff.;</a> <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.002.clans.htm"><i>Buddh.
