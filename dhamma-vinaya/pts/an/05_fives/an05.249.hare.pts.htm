					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages in a cemetery.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is unclean,<br />
					evil-smelling,<br />
					fearful,<br />
					the haunt of bestial non-humans,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks, there are these five disadvantages<br />

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, monks, some person<br />

					who follows the course of unclean action in word<br />
					who follows the course of unclean action in thought —<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is unclean,<br />

					<p class="f4">At once his course is of unclean action in deed,<br />

					<p class="f4">I declare this to be his making others wail.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, just as that cemetery is the cause of many folk wailing,<br />
