					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk visited the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, they say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Living by Dhamma, living by Dbamma!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, how does a monk live by Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monk, consider the monk who masters Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">the sayings,<br />
					psalms,<br />
					catechisms,<br />
					songs,<br />
					solemnities,<br />
					speeches,<br />
					birth-stories,<br />
					marvels<br />

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to master,<br />
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider the monk who teaches others Dhamma in detail,<br />
					as he has heard it,<br />
					as he has mastered it -<br />
					he spends the day in convincing others of Dhamma;<br />
					but knows not through insight the goal beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to convince,<br />
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, consider the monk who gives in full a repetition of Dhamma,<br />
					as he has heard it,<br />
					as he has learned it -<br />
					he spends the day in repeating it;<br />
					but knows not through insight the goal beyond..</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to repeat,<br />
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then consider the monk who turns his mind to Dhamma,<br />
					ponders over it,<br />
					reflects on it,<br />
					as he has heard it,<br />
					as he has learned it -<br />
					he spends his day in thinking about Dhamma;<br />

					<p class="f4">Monk, that monk is said to be swift to think,<br />
					but he lives not by Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, monk, take the case of the monk who masters Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">the sayings,<br />
					psalms,<br />
					catechisms,<br />
					songs,<br />
					solemnities,<br />
					speeches,<br />
					birth-stories,<br />
					marvels<br />
					and runes -</p>

					<p class="f4">and spends not the day in that mastery,<br />
					but knows through insight the goal beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monk, such a monk is one who lives by Dhamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, thus, verily, have I declared one swift to master,<br />
					one swift to convince,<br />
					one swift to repeat,<br />
					one swift to think<br />
					and one who lives by Dhamma.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monk, what should be done by a teacher for his disciples,<br />
					seeking their good,<br />
					from compassion and out of pity,<br />
					that has been done by me for you!</p>

					<p class="f4">(Behold) these tree-roots,<br />
					tiese empty places, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Meditate, monk,<br />
					and be not slothful;<br />
					reproach not yourself afterwards!</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our command to you.'</p>
