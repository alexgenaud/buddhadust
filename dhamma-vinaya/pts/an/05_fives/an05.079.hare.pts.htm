					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five fears in the way,<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be ye fully awake for them;<br />

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there will be, in the long road of the future,<br />

					not made virtue become,<br />
					not made mind become,<br />
					not made insight become<br />

					and verily they will not be able to lead them<br />
					in the way of higher virtue,<br />
					higher mind,<br />

					not made virtue become,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus verily, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thua verily, monks,<br />
					from corrupt Dhamma<br />
					comes corrupt Discipline;<br />
					from corrupt Discipline<br />
					corrupt Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the second fear in the way which,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body beeome,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, monks who have not made body beeome,<br />
					not made virtue become,<br />
					not made mind become,<br />
					not made insight become;<br />

					lend an ear,<br />
