<meta name="description" content="The E.M. Hare translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fives, Sutta 196. Before his awakening, Gotama has five dreams revealing the future: that he would become the Awakened One, that he would see and know and establish the Eight-Dimensional High Way, that he would bring many lay persons to refuge in the Dhamma, that he will bring people of all colors and status from the four courners of the world to complete awakening, and that he would receive the essentials without attachment." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> These five are referred to at <i>J.</i> i, 69; see Thomas' Life, 70 n. Our <i>Comy.</i> observes that there are four dream-causes: (1) body-disturbanees, due to bile, produsing dreams such as falling from a precipice or flying or being chased by a beast or robber; (2) previous happenings; (3) being deva-possessed, and devas bring thoughts both for one's good and otherwise; (4) premonitions; this last is the Bodhisat's. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Milinda,</i> Dilemma 75 (p. 297).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Ohita</i> (Thomas <i>loc. cit.</i>), 'plunged,' but <i>Comy.</i> <i>na udakasmiɱ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> I give a literal trsl. of the five; the meaning no doubt is that the Bodhisat so interpreted the dreams.</p>
