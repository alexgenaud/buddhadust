					the brāhmaṇī becomes<br />

					for sport<br />
					and for pleasure<br />
					or to beget offspring.</p>

					<p class="f4">He leads a life doing all these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brāhmans say thus of him;</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it that an honourable brāhman<br />

					<a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> but not by that is the fire defiled;<br />
					even so, good sire, if a brāhman lead a life doing all these things,<br />
					not by that is a brāhman defiled."</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He leads a life doing all these things,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and therefore he is called a brāhman-outcast.</p>
