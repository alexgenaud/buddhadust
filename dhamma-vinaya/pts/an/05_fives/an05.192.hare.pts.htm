					or to beget offspring.</p>

					<p class="f4">He leads a life doing all these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brāhmans say thus of him;</p>

					<p class="f4">"How is it that an honourable brāhman<br />

					even so, good sire, if a brāhman lead a life doing all these things,<br />
					not by that is a brāhman defiled."</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He leads a life doing all these things,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and therefore he is called a brāhman-outcast.</p>
