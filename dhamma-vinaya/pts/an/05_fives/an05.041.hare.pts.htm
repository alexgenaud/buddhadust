					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					in Jeta Grove, at Anāthapiṇdika's Park;<br />
					and there Anathapiṇḍika, the householder, came and visited him and,<br />
					after saluting,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					the Exalted One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Householder, there are these five reasons for getting<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> rich.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the case of an Ariyan disciple<br />
					with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br />
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br />
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br />
					justly obtained in a lawful way<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					he makes himself happy,<br />
					glad,<br />
					and keeps that great happiness,<br />
					he makes his parents happy,<br />
					glad,<br />
					and keeps them so;<br />
					he makes his wife and children,<br />
					glad,<br />
					and keeps them so;<br />
					he makes his slaves,<br />
					glad,<br />
					and keeps them so;<br />
					he makes work-folk and men,<br />
					glad,<br />
					and keeps them so.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br />
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br />
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br />
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br />
					he makes his friends and companions happy,<br />
					glad,<br />
					and keeps them so.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br />
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br />
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br />
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br />
					ill-luck from fire and water,<br />
					rajahs and robbers,<br />
					enemies and heirs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is warded off,<br />
					and he keeps his goods in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br />
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br />
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br />
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br />
					he makes the fiive oblations,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is to say:<br />
					oblations to kin,<br />
					guests,<br />
					petas,<br />
					rajahs<br />
					and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a> Moreover, householder, with riches gotten by work and zeal,<br />
					gathered by the strength of the arm,<br />
					earned by the sweat of the brow,<br />
					justly obtained in a lawful way,<br />
					the Ariyan diseiple institutes offerings,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of lofty aim,<br />
					celestial,<br />
					ripening to happiness,<br />
					leading heavenward,<br />
					for all those recluses and godly men<br />
					who abstain from pride and indolence,<br />
					who bear all things in patience and humility,<br />
					each mastering self,<br />
					each calming self,<br />
					eaeh perfecting self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth reason for getting rich.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, there are these five reasons for getting rich.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if the wealth of that Ariyan disciple,<br />
					heeding these five reasons,<br />
					come to destruction,<br />
					let him consider thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"At least, I've heeded<br />
					those reasons for getting rich,<br />
					but my wealth has gone!" —</p>

					<p class="f4">thus he is not upset.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And if his wealth increase,<br />
					let him think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Truly, I've heeded<br />
					those reasons for getting rich,<br />
					and my wealth has grown! —</p>

					<p class="f4">thus he is not upset in either case.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Bred,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> borne and battened is my household all<br />
							Upon my wealth; I've warded off ill-luck;<br />
							Made five oblations; furnished those good men.<br />
							Who lead the godly life composed, with gifts<br />
							And offerings of lofty aim; that meed,<br />
							The wealth wise householders should seek, by me<br />
							Is won — whate'er befall there's no regret!"</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso considers thus, that man firm set<br />
							In Ariyan Dhamma here on earth they praise.<br />
							And afterwards in heaven he finds delight.</p>
