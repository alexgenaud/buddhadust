<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Fives, Sutta 71. The Buddha describes how the development and making a big thing of the idea of their being nothing attractive in the body, the disgusting nature of food, the thought of distaste for the world, the perception of impermanance in everything that has been own-made, and the establishment in mind of the thought of death has its fruition in freedom of heart and the advantages of freedom of heart and freedom of wisdom and the advantages of freedom of wisdom." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these five things,<br />
					when made become,<br />
					made an increase in,<br />
					have as their fruits<br />
					mind-emancipation<br />
					and the advantages thereof,<br />
					insight-emancipation<br />
					and the advantages thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk abides<br />
					perceiving the foulness of the body;<br />
					is conscious of the cloying of food;<br />
					is conscious of distaste as to the world;<br />
					perceives impermanence in all compounded things;<br />
					and the thought of death<br />
					is by him inwardly well established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these five things,<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, when<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> indeed a monk is both<br />
