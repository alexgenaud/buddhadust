					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near Rājagaha, at the Squirrels' Feeding Ground<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in the Bamboo Grove;<br />
					and there Cundī,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the rajah's daughter,<br />
					attended by five hundred maidens<br />
					in a like number of chariots,<br />
					came and visited him and,<br />
					after saluting,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seated, Cundī, the rajah's daughter, spoke to the Exalted One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, our royal brother, Cunda, says this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When a woman or man has taken refuge in the Buddha,<br />
					has taken refuge in Dhamma,<br />
					has taken refuge in the Order,<br />
					abstains from taking life,<br />
					from taking what is not given,<br />
					from carnal lusts,<br />
					from lying<br />
					and from indulging in spirituous liquor, causing idleness;<br />
					he will surely arise,<br />
					on the breaking up of the body alter death,<br />
					to a fair course,<br />
					not to an ill one.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I, lord, would ask the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's trust in what sort of teacher will one surely arise,<br />
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					to a fair course<br />
					and not to an ill one?</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's trust in what sort of Dhamma will one surely arise,<br />
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					to a fair course<br />
					and not to an ill one?</p>

					<p class="f4">With one's trust in what sort of Order will one surely arise,<br />
					on the breaking up of the body after death,<br />
					to a fair course<br />
					and not to an ill one?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what sorts of virtuous practices must one perform<br />
					to arise, after death,<br />
					to a fair course and not to an ill one?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever orders or communities there are, Cundī,<br />
					of them the Order of the Tathāgata's disciples is declared the best,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the four pairs of men,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> the eight persons,<br />
					that Order of disciples of the Exalted One,<br />
					which is worthy of offerings,<br />

					incorrupt<br />
					and conducive to concentration;<br />

					perform the best,<br />

							Distinguish best;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> who in the Buddha see<br />
							The gift-worthy, the unsurpassed, the best;<br />
							In Dhamma best the ease of passion's calm;<br />

							For merit - yea, for those who alms bestow<br />
							In the best place best merit doth increase,<br />
							And life and beauty, honour, fame and power,<br />
							Best happiness. Who gives unto the best,<br />

(<i>To himself,</i> viii, 5; Rendall's <i>trsl.,</i> 1910); <i>cf. Vin.</i> iii, 20: <i>bhagavatā anekapariyāyena rāgavirāgāya dhammo desito, madanimmadanāya,</i> etc., as here.</p>
