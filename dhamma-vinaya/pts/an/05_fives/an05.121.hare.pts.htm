If a sick person can keep in mind the idea of their being nothing attractive in the body, the disgusting nature of food, the thought of distaste for the world, the perception of impermanance in everything that has been own-made, and has established in his mind the thought of death, he may expect Arahantship even in this life." />

					<p class="f4">On one occasion, when he was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Veaālī</a>, at the Gabled Hall in Mahāvana, the Exalted One, arising from seclusion at eventide, visited the hall of the sick.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw a monk, weak and ailing;<br />
					and at the sight he sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was seated, the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if five things forsake not anyone weak and ailing,<br />
					for him this may be expected:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere long,<br />
					by destroying the cankers,<br />
					he will enter and abide in<br />
					the emancipation of mind,<br />
					the emancipation of insight,<br />
					which is free of cankers,<br />
					realizing this by his own knowledge<br />
					even both here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk abides<br />
					seeing nothing attractive in the body;<br />
					is conscious of the cloying of food;<br />
					conscious of distaste as to the world;<br />
					perceives impermanence in the compounded;<br />
					and his inner self is well set<br />
					on the thought of death.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, if these five things forsake not anyone weak and ailing,<br />
