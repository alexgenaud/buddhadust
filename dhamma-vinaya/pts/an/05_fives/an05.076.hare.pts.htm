					<p class="f4">patting away ill-will and hatred,<br />
					he abides with heart free therefrom;<br />
					kindly and compassionate to all creatures,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of ill-will and hatred:</p>

					<p class="f4">putting away sloth and torpor,<br />
					he abides free therefrom;<br />
					conscious of light,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of sloth and torpor:</p>

					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed;</p>

					<p class="f4">free from the fervour of zest,<br />

					and is free of ease and ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the heart thus serene,<br />
