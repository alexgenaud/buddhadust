					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br />

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br />
					follow the course of five things,<br />
					as his reward he is surely cast into hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He is stingy as to praise;<br />
					he is stingy over (sharing) his lodging;<br />
					he is stingy as to the family (who provides);<br />
					he is stingy as to gains<br />
					he is stingy of Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if a monk in residence<br />
					follow the course of these five things,<br />

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not stingy as to praise;<br />
					he is not stingy over (sharing) his lodging;<br />
					he is not stingy as to the family (who provides);<br />
					he is not stingy as to gains<br />
					he is stingy of Dhamma.</p>
