					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One<br />
					with a great company of monks,<br />
					while wandering for alms among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalese,</a><br />
					came to the brahman village of Icchānangala<br />
					belonging to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there the Exalted One dwelt in the Icchānangala woodland thicket.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brāhman householders of Icchānangala heard of this.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Mark you,' they said,<br />
					the recluse, Master Gotama, the Sakya,<br />
					gone forth from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					has come to Icchānangala<br />
					and dwells in our wood near by;<br />
					and of this same Master <a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> Gotama<br />
					this excellent report goes abroad:</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					perfectly enlightened,<br />
					endowed with wisdom and righteousness,<br />
					one well-gone,<br />
					a world-knower,<br />
					the unsurpassed,<br />
					a tamer of tamable men,<br />
					a teacher,<br />
					a Buddha of devas and men,<br />
					the Exalted One!</p>

					<p class="f4">Having realized more-knowledge himself,<br />
					he declares it to this world<br />
					with its devas<br />
					and Māras<br />
					and Brahmas,<br />
					to this earth with its recluses and brahmans,<br />
					its devas and men;<br />
					and he teaches Dhamma,<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in.the middle<br />
					and lovely in the end;<br />
					and sets forth the godly life,<br />
					utterly pure and perfect,<br />
					both in spirit and letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed is it to see such arahants!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the night was over,<br />
					they went to the wood,<br />
					taking with them a great deal of hard and soft food,<br />
					and stood outside the entrance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					making a great din and uproar.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Nāgita<br />
					was the Exalted One's personal attendant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One called to the venerable Nāgita and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who are these, Nāgita, that make this great din and uproar?</p>

					<p class="f4">Like fisherfolk, methinks,<br />
					with a great haul of fish!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'These men, lord, are the brahman householders of Icchānangala,<br />
					who wait outside the gateway.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have brought much hard and soft food<br />
					for the Exalted One and for the Order.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have naught to do with homage, Nāgita,<br />
					nor has homage aught to do with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whosoever cannot obtain at will,<br />
					easily and without difficulty<br />
					this happiness of renunciation,<br />
					this happiness of seclusion,<br />
					this happiness of calm<br />
					and this happiness of enlightenment,<br />
					which I can obtain at will,<br />
					easily and without difficulty,<br />
					let him enjoy that dung-like happiness,<br />
					that sluggish happiness,<br />
					that happiness gotten of<br />
					gains,<br />
					favours<br />
					and flattery.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Exalted One accept (their offerings)!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Well-gone accept;<br />
					now, lord,<br />
					is the time for the Blessed One to accept!</p>

					<p class="f4">For wheresoever henceforth the Exalted One shall go,<br />
					the brahman householders of town and country<br />
					will be just as inclined (to give).</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, just as when the (rain-) deva <a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> rains big drops,<br />
					the water flows with the incline;<br />
					even so, lord,<br />
					wheresoever the Exalted One shall henceforth go,<br />
					the brahman householders of town and country<br />
					wil1 be inclined.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, it is because of the virtue and wisdom of the Edited One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nāgita, I have naught to do with homage,<br />
					nor has homage aught to dö with me.</p>
