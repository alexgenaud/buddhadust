Ārabhati</i> is <i>lit.</i> to start (doing something); and <i>vippaṭisārī:</i> strongly remembering something against (oneself), so generally 'remorse.' <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/abhi/idx_04_pug.htm#s5.1"><i>Pug.</i> 64.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The text reads <i>ārabbhajā,</i> but <i>S.e.</i> with <i>v.l.</i> and <i>Comy.</i> <i>ārambhajā</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Hare's construction of these goes: "...the cankers, born of doing amiss, are discovered; born of dejection they wax...". This creates problems in the following sections which he has abridged with the indication that this pattern should be followed. I have altered his rendering to parallel the Pali.</p>
