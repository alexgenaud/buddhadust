					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/05_fives/an05.078.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/05_fives/an05.078.than.ati.htm#p1">than</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five fears in the way<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from contemplating which<br />
					the earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute monk,<br />
					ought to live<br />
					just to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am now young,<br />
					a mere youth,<br />
					black-haired<br />
					and blessed with the beauty of youth,<br />
					the heyday of youth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the prime of youth;<br />
					but time will be<br />
					when old age shall touch this body:<br />
					and when grown old<br />
					and overcome by age,<br />
					not easy is it<br />
					to turn to the Buddhas' word,<br />
					not easy things<br />
					are forest-wilderness,<br />
					the outland bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> that state come to me —<br />
					unwelcome,<br />
					undesired,<br />
					unloved —<br />
					lof I will put forth energy<br />
					against that time<br />
					even to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered, <a id="pg83"><span class="f2 g"><b>[83]</b></span></a> to realize the unrealized,<br />
					and of that state possessed<br />
					I will dwell comforted even when old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first fear in the way<br />
					from contemplating which<br />
					the earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute monk,<br />
					ought to live<br />
					just to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I have health and well-being,<br />
					a good digestion<br />
					which is neither over-cold<br />
					nor over-heated,<br />
					but even and suitable for striving;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> but time will be<br />
					when sickness shall touch this body;<br />
					and sick and ill,<br />
					not easy is it<br />
					to turn to the Buddhas' word,<br />
					not easy things<br />
					are forest-wilderness,<br />
					the outland bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere that state come to me —<br />
					unwelcome,<br />
					undesired,<br />
					unloved —<br />
					lof I will put forth energy<br />
					against that time<br />
					even to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered, to realize the unrealized,<br />
					and of that state possessed<br />
					I will dwell comforted even when sick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the second fear in the way<br />
					from contemplating which<br />
					the earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute monk,<br />
					ought to live<br />
					just to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is there no famine<br />
					and crops are good,<br />
					food is easy to get<br />
					and it is easy<br />
					to keep oneself going<br />
					by gleanings and favours;<br />
					but time will be<br />
					when there is a famine,<br />
					bad crops,<br />
					and difficulty in getting food,<br />
					nor will it be easy<br />
					to keep oneself going<br />
					by gleanings and favours;<br />
					and the famine-stricken men<br />
					will move to where there is ample food,<br />
					and there one will dwell in a crowd<br />
					and a throng:<br />
					and where such conditions are,<br />
					not easy is it<br />
					to turn to the Buddhas' word,<br />
					not easy things<br />
					are forest-wilderness,<br />
					the outland bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere that state come to me —<br />
					unwelcome,<br />
					undesired,<br />
					unloved —<br />
					lof I will put forth energy<br />
					against that time<br />
					even to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered, to realize the unrealized,<br />
					and of that state possessed<br />
					I will dwell comforted even in time of famine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the third fear in the way<br />
					from contemplating which<br />
					the earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute monk,<br />
					ought to live<br />
					just to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again take the case of a monk who reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now men dwell in friendly fellowship together,<br />
					as mingled milk and water,<br />
					they do not quarrel,<br />
					but look upon one another with friendly eye;<br />
					but time will be<br />
					when fear is about,<br />
					perils of robbers,<br />
					and the country-folk mount their carts<br />
					and drive away,<br />
					and the fear-stricken men<br />
					will move away<br />
					to where there is safety,<br />
					and there one will live in crowds<br />
					and throngs:<br />
					and where such conditions are,<br />
					not easy is it<br />
					to turn to the Buddhas' word,<br />
					not easy things<br />
					are forest-wilderness,<br />
					the outland bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere that state come to me —<br />
					unwelcome,<br />
					undesired,<br />
					unloved —<br />
					lof I will put forth energy<br />
					against that time<br />
					even to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered, to realize the unrealized,<br />
					and of that state possessed<br />
					I will dwell comforted even in time of fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fourth fear in the way<br />
					from contemplating which<br />
					the earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute monk,<br />
					ought to live<br />
					just to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, the monk reflects thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Order lives in friendly fellowship together,<br />
					finding comfort in one teaching;<br />
					but the time will come<br />
					when the Order will be rent:<br />
					and when that happens,<br />
					not easy is it to turn to the Buddhas' word,<br />
					not easy things<br />
					are forest-wilderness,<br />
					the outland <a id="pg84"><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></a> bed and seat, to seek.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ere that state come to me —<br />
					unwelcome,<br />
					undesired,<br />
					unloved —<br />
					lof I will put forth energy<br />
					against that time<br />
					even to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered, to realize the unrealized,<br />
					and of that state possessed<br />
					I will dwell comforted even though the Order be rent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the fifth fear in the way<br />
					from contemplating which<br />
					the earnest,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolute monk,<br />
					ought to live<br />
					just to attain the unattained,<br />
					to master the unmastered,<br />
					to realize the unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these are the five fears in the way<br />
