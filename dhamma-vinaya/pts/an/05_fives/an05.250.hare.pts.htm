					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One dwelt near Sāvatthī;<br />
					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five disadvantages<br />
					of devotion to one person.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, when a person<br />
					becomes very devoted to a person<br />
					and that person falls into an error<br />
					such that the Order suspend him,<br />
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Order has suspended<br />
					him who is dear and lovely to me!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will be no more<br />
					full of devotion for the monks,<br />
					and from being without that devotion<br />
					he will not follow other monks,<br />
					and from not following other monks<br />
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br />
					and from not hearing Saddhamma<br />
					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first disadvantage<br />
					of devotion to one person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or that person falls into an error<br />
					such that the Order make him sit on the outskirts (of a gathering),<br />
					then he will think:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Order has made<br />
					him who is dear and lovely to me<br />
					sit on the outskirts!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And he will be no more<br />
					full of devotion for the monks,<br />
					and from being without that devotion<br />
					he will not follow other monks,<br />
					and from not following other monks<br />
					he will not hear Saddhamma,<br />
					and from not hearing Saddhamma<br />
					he will fall away from Saddhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second disadvantage<br />

					<p class="f4">Or when a person<br />

					<p class="f4">And he will not follow other monks,<br />
