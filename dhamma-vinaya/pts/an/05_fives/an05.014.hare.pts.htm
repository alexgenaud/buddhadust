					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five powers.</p>

					steadfast and strenuous,<br />
					he shirks not the burden of right things.</p>

					which is born of solitude<br />

					he enters and abides in the second musing,<br />
					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of joy and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed;<br />
					free from the zest for joy,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the third musing,<br />
