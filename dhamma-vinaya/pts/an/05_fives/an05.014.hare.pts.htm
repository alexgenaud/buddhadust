					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five powers.</p>

					which is self-evolved,<br />
					born of concentration,<br />
					full of joy and ease,<br />
					free from applied and sustained thought,<br />
					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed;<br />
					free from the zest for joy,<br />
