					and there he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord,' they replied; and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five spheres<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of release<br />
					wherein the unreleased mind of a monk,<br />
					abiding zealous,<br />
					ardent<br />

					finds release;<br />
					or the cankers,<br />
					not yet wholly destroyed,<br />
					come to complete destruction;<br />
					or the unsurpassed peace from effort,<br />
					not yet attained,<br />
					is won.</p>

					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, take the case when the Master,<br />
					or some fellow in the godly life<br />
					who acts as teacher,<br />
					instructs a monk in Dhamma —<br />
					while he teaches,<br />
					that monk partakes of both the spirit<br />
					and the letter<br />
					of this Dhamma;<br />
					when the Master,<br />
					or some fellow in the godly life<br />
					who acts as teacher,<br />
					instructs a monk in Dhamma<br />
					gladness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> springs <a id="pg16"><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></a> up;<br />

					ease is experienced;<br />
					and for him who dwells at ease<br />
					the mind is composed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the first sphere of release<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, when the Master,<br />

					as he has learnt it by heart —<br />

					<p class="f4">Monks, this is the second sphere of release<br />
