					<p class="f4"><a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple has faith<br />

					fully enlightened,<br />
					abounding in wisdom and right,<br />
					the well-gone,<br />
					the world-knower,<br />
					the incomparable tamer of tamable men,<br />

					the Buddha, the Exalted One."</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of faith.</p>

					he shirks not the burden of right things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the power of energy.</p>

					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of conscientiousness;<br />
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of fear of blame;<br />
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of energy;<br />
					we will become possessed of the learner's power called the power of insight.</p>
