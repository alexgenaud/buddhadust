					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One with<br />
					a great following of monks<br />
					walked a walk among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as the Exalted One went along the highway<br />
					he saw a place where grew a big grove of sal trees;<br />
					and seeing it there,<br />
					he moved down from the road<br />
					and went towards it<br />
					and made his way among the trees;<br />
					and at a certain place<br />
					he smiled.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What cause now,<br />
					what reason<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					moved the Exalted One to show a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for nothing<br />
					do Tathāgatas smile.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda asked him<br />
					concerning the matter:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What cause now,<br />
					what reason<br />
					moved the Exalted One to show a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not for nothing<br />
					do Tathāgatas smile.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(Then said the Exalted One:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this place, Ānanda,<br />
					in olden times<br />
					there was a rich and flourishing city<br />
					thronged with many people;<br />
					and by the city, Ānanda,<br />
					there dwelt the Exalted One, Kassapa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened;<br />
					and Gavesin was a lay-disciple<br />
					of the Exalted One, Kassapa;<br />
					but he kept not the moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Now beoause of Gavesin<br />
					there were about five hundred who testified<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and were stirred to discipleship,<br />
					but they kept not the moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought he:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br />
					being the first to move and bestir myself;<br />
					yet I keep not the moral precepts<br />
					nor do these five hundred others.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					leaving no whit of a more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm for something more!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So Gavesin went up to the five hundred<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Know, good sirs,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from today<br />
					that I keep the moral precepts."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda, those five hundred<br />
					thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, Master Gavesin has greatly served us,<br />
					being first to move and bestir himself,<br />
					and this same Master Gavesin<br />
					will <a id="pg159"><span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span></a> now keep the moral precepts —<br />
					why then not we too?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then went those five hundred lay-disciples to Gavesin<br />
					and told him that they too<br />
					henceforth<br />
					would keep the moral precepts.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again thought Gavesin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br />
					being the first to move and bestir myself;<br />
					being the first to keep the moral precepts,<br />
					and now they too keep the moral precepts,<br />
					but I do not follow the celibate's life,<br />
					the life remote,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<br />

					<p class="f4">So Gavesin went up to the five hundred<br />

					<p class="f4">Then went those five hundred lay-disciples to Gavesin<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again thought Gavesin:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the lay-disciple Gavesin considered thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have greatly served these five hundred lay-disciples,<br />

					being the first to keep the moral precepts,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is a levelling of levels,<br />
					leaving no whit of a more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm for something more!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And, Ānanda,<br />
					the lay-disciple Gavesin<br />
					went to the Exalted One, Kassapa,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened,<br />
					and, having come,<br />
					said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, grant that I may go forth beside the Exalted One;<br />
					grant me full acceptance!"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					and Gavesin,<br />
					the lay-disciple,<br />
					obtained permission to go forth beside Kassapa,<br />
					the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened;<br />
					he obtained full acceptance.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a> Now not long after his acceptance, Ānanda,<br />
					Gavesin the monk,<br />
					living alone,<br />
					withdrawn,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolved,<br />
					entered into and abode in<br />
					that unsurpassed goal of the godly life,<br />

					realizing it by his own knowledge —<br />
					that goal<br />
					for the good of which<br />
					clansmen's sons rightly go forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life —<br />
					and he declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">Destroyed is birth,<br />
					lived is the godly life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					there is no more this-ness!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter, Ānanda,<br />
					the monk Gavesin<br />
					was numbered among the arahants.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought those five hundred lay-disciples:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Verily, Master Gavesin has greatly served us,<br />
					being first to move and bestir himself,<br />
					being first to keep the moral precepts<br />

					and now we too are one-mealers<br />
					abstaining from night-eating,<br />
					giving up eating at wrong times,<br />
					and this same Master Gavesin<br />
					now has had his hair and beard shaved off,<br />
					donned the yellow robe,<br />
					and goes forth from the home to the homeless life;<br />
					why then not we too?"</p>

					<p class="f4">And those five hundred lay-disciples, Ānanda,<br />
					went and begged the Exalted One, Kassapa,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Grant, lord, that we may go forth beside the Exalted One;<br />
					grant us full acceptance!"<br />
					- and those five hundred<br />
					obtained permission to go forth beside Kassapa,<br />
					the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened;<br />
					obtained full acceptance.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought the monk Gavesin:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, verily, can obtain<br />
					this unsurpassed bliss of liberation<br />
					at will,<br />
					easily,<br />
					and without difficulty;<br />
					would that these five hundred monks<br />
					could obtain this bliss<br />
					at will,<br />
					easily,<br />
					and without difficulty!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, those five hundred monks<br />
					abode alone,<br />
					withdrawn,<br />
					zealous,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					resolved;<br />
					and, not long after,<br />
					entered into and abode in<br />

					lived is the godly life,<br />
					done is the task,<br />
					there is no more this-ness!</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus verily, Ānanda,<br />
					those five hundred monks<br />
					with Gavesin at their head,<br />
					in striving from higher things to higher,<br />
					from strength to strength,<br />
					came to realize a liberation,<br />
					above which there is no higher.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Ānanda,<br />
					train yourselves in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">From higher to higher,<br />
					from strength to strength,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Verily thus, Ānanda, train ye yourselves.'</p>
