<meta name="description" content="E.M. Hare's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Sixes, Sutta 28. A group of bhikkhus has gathered around to discuss the appropriate time for visiting a bhikkhu who has become mind. Their suggestions all have to do with the convenience of the visit for the mind-become bhikkhu. Maha Kaccana however heard the teaching of the Buddha himself on the subject when a bhikkhu asks the Buddha about the same issue. He then relates the sutta [AN 6.27.] in which the Buddha describes the six occasions when such a visit is called for: at the time a bhikkhu is harassed by lust for sense pleasures, the anger and hate resulting from deviance from the way, sluggishness, anxiety from remorse, uncertainty, and not knowing what indicates what such as to terminate the corrupting influences." />

					<p class="f4">Once, when many elders dwelt at the Deer Park in Isipatana, near Benares,<br />
					there arose by chance this talk among them,<br />
					as they sat assembled in the round hall,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					after breakfast,<br />
					on their return from alms-collecting:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What's the proper time, reverend sirs,<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind?'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now having stated this,<br />
					a certain monk said to the elders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When, reverend sirs, a monk,<br />
					a student of mind,<br />
					has returned from alms-collecting,<br />
					breakfasted,<br />
					washed his feet,<br />
					seated himself,<br />
					crossed his legs,<br />
					straightened his body<br />
					and made mindfulness stand up,<br />
					as it were,<br />
					before him;<br />
					then is the time to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And after he had thus spoken, another said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, reverend sirs,<br />
					that is not the time to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind;<br />
					for when he has returned from alms-collecting,<br />
					breakfasted,<br />
					washed his feet,<br />
					seated himself,<br />
					crossed his legs,<br />
					straightened his body<br />
					and made mindfulness stand up,<br />
					as it were,<br />
					before him;<br />
					he is languid from his walk<br />
					and is not then completely at ease;<br />
					or he is languid after his meal<br />
					and is not then completely at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time,<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, sirs, in the evening<br />
					he has risen from seclusion<br />
					and is seated in the shade of his lodging,<br />
					cross-legged,<br />
					with body erect,<br />
					with mindfulness set before him;<br />
					then is the time to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said another:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, verily, reverend sirs,<br />
					that is not the time to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind; for when, reverend sirs, in the evening<br />
					he has risen from seclusion<br />
					and is seated in the shade of his lodging,<br />
					cross-legged,<br />
					with body erect,<br />
					with mindfulness set before him<br />
					whatsoever concentration-image<br />
					he has by day concentrated on,<br />
					just that will then beset him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time<br />
					to go and see that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when, sirs, night recedes<br />
					and day dawns<br />
					and he is seated cross-legged<br />
					with body erect<br />
					with mindfulness set before him;<br />
					then is the time to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But another monk said:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Endue. (indue) from induce, induct. With meanings such as digest, take the form of, dress, clothe, overlay, cover, endow with an ability, talent, attribute, etc. Invest with an honour, dignity, etc. Supply with something. Bring up, educate, instruct.<br />

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, neither is that the time<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who is a student of mind;<br />
					for when night recedes<br />
					and day dawns<br />
					and he is seated cross-legged<br />
					with body erect<br />
					<a id="pg227"><span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span></a> with mindfulness set before him,<br />
					then is his body endued with strength<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he finds comfort in pondering<br />
					on the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore that is not the time<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had thus spoken,<br />
					the venerable Mahā Kaccāna said this to the elders:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Erom the mouth of the Exalted One, reverend sirs,<br />

					from his own mouth have I received this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these six times<br />

					a monk who is a student of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monk, when a monk is obsessed in heart by passionate lust,<br />
					overwhelmed by passionate lust<br />
					and knows no refuge,<br />
					as there really is,<br />
					from the surge of passionate lust;<br />
					then let him visit a monk,<br />
					who has made a study of mind,<br />
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by passionate lust,<br />
					overwhelmed thereby,<br />
					nor know I any refuge from the surge thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br />
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br />
					to rid me of this lusting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br />
					to rid him of that lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the first time<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by ill-will<br />
					overwhelmed by ill-will<br />
					and knows no refuge,<br />
					as there really is,<br />
					from the surge of ill-will;<br />
					then let him visit a monk,<br />
					who has made a study of mind,<br />
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by ill-will,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br />
					to rid him of that ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the second time<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by sloth and torpor<br />
					overwhelmed by sloth and torpor<br />
					and knows no refuge,<br />
					as there really is,<br />
					from the surge of sloth and torpor;<br />
					then let him visit a monk,<br />
					who has made a study of mind,<br />
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by sloth and torpor,<br />
					overwhelmed by sloth and torpor,<br />

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br />
					to rid him of that sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the third time<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by flurry and worry<br />
					overwhelmed by flurry and worry<br />
					and knows no refuge,<br />
					as there really is,<br />
					from the surge of flurry and worry;<br />
					then let him visit a monk,<br />
					who has made a study of mind,<br />
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by flurry and worry,<br />
					overwhelmed by flurry and worry,<br />

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br />
					if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br />
					to rid me of this flurry and worry.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br />
					to rid him of that flurry and worry.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the fourth time<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, when in heart he is obsessed by or by doubt,<br />
					overwhelmed by doubt<br />
					and knows no refuge,<br />
					as there really is,<br />
					from the surge of doubt;<br />
					then let him visit a monk,<br />
					who has made a study of mind,<br />
					and say this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, I am indeed obsessed in heart by doubt,<br />
					overwhelmed by doubt,<br />
					nor know I any refuge from the surge of doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me,<br />

					to rid me of this doubt.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhamma<br />
					to rid him of that doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the fifth time<br />
					to go and see a monk<br />
					who has made a study of mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monk, when from some image,<br />
					as he concentrates thereon,<br />
					there comes not to him at intervals<br />
					canker-destruction,<br />
					nor knows he that image<br />
					nor realizes it;<br />
					then let him visit a monk,<br />
					who has made a study of mind, and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Good sir, from this image,<br />
					as I concentrate thereon,<br />
					there comes not to me at intervals<br />

					<p class="f4">Well were it for me, if the venerable one would teach me Dhamma<br />
					to the end that I may destroy the cankers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk will teach him Dhanāna to destroy the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monk, is the sixth time<br />

					<p class="f4">From the mouth of the Exalted One<br />
