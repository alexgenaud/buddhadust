					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nādika,<br />
					a householder,<br />
					a wood-seller,<br />
					visited him,<br />
					saluted<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the Exalted One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Maybe, householder, alms are given by your family?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg279"><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span></a> '0 yes, lord, and in this way too:<br />

					arahants<br />
					or men won to the arahant's Way -<br />
					to them, lord, alms are given by my family.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'But surely, householder,<br />

					merry with silver and gold<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
