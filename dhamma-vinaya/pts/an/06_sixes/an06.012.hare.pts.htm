					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are six ways of being considerate, which endear,<br />
					bring honour,<br />
					lead to concord,<br />
					banish contention,<br />
					lead to unity,<br />
					lead to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk's part is amity in deed<br />
					towards his fellows in the godly life,<br />
					openly and in private;<br />
					verily, this is a way of being considerate,<br />
					which endears,<br />
					brings honour,<br />
					leads to concord,<br />
					banishes contention,<br />
					leads to unity,<br />
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, his part is amity in word,<br />
					towards his fellows in the godly life,<br />
					openly and in private;<br />
					verily, this also is a way of being considerate,<br />
					which endears,<br />
					brings honour,<br />
					leads to concord,<br />
					banishes contention,<br />
					leads to unity,<br />
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, those proper gains,<br />
					gotten according to rule -<br />
					be they but böwl-scraps -<br />
					he loves to share them impartially,<br />
					to have them in common<br />
					with his virtuous fellows in the godly life;<br />
					this also is a way of being considerate,<br />
					which endears,<br />
					brings honour,<br />
					leads to concord,<br />
					banishes contention,<br />
					leads to unity,<br />
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And those virtues that are unbroken,<br />
					without flaw,<br />
					spotless,<br />
					without blemish,<br />
					bringing freedom,<br />
					praised by wise men,<br />
					incorruptible,<br />
					leading to concentration -<br />
					he dwells one in virtue with them<br />
					among his fellows in the godly life,<br />
					openly and in private;<br />
					this also is a way of being considerate,<br />
					which endears,<br />
					brings honour,<br />
					leads to concord,<br />
					banishes contention,<br />
					leads to unity,<br />
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And that Ariyan view,<br />
					saving,<br />
					leading him who acts accordantly<br />
					to the utter destruction of Ill -<br />
					he dwells one in view with that<br />
					among his fellows in the godly life,<br />
					openly and in private;<br />
					this also is a way of being considerate,<br />
					which endears,<br />
					brings honour,<br />
					leads to concord,<br />
					banishes contention,<br />
					leads to unity,<br />
					leads to singleness of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, these are the six ways of being considerate, which endear,<br />
					bring honour,<br />
					lead to concord,<br />
					banish contention,<br />
					lead to unity,<br />
					lead to singleness of heart.'</p>
