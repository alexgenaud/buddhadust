					<p class="f4">Once, while the Exalted One<br />
					walked a walk among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalese</a><br />
					with a great company of the Order's monks,<br />
					he came to a Kosalan town called Dandakappaka.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One<br />
					stepped down from the road<br />
					and sat on a seat made ready<br />
					at the foot of a tree;<br />
					but the monks entered Dandakappaka<br />
					to seek a lodging.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					with a number of monks,<br />
					went to the river Aciravatī<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to bathe his limbs;<br />
					and after he had bathed<br />
					and had come out,<br />
					he stood in one garment<br />
					drying his limbs.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then a monk approached the venerable Ānanda<br />
					and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, reverend sir,<br />
					was it after concentrating his whole mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">"Gone<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> wayward,<br />
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br />

					<p class="f4">or was it from some deva-source<br />
					(he learnt it)?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> 'It was even as the Exalted One has declared.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda<br />
					approached the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted<br />
					and sat down at one side;<br />
					and so seated,<br />
					he told the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now I, bhante,<br />
					with a number of monks,<br />
					went to the river to bathe our limbs;<br />
					and after I had bathed<br />
					and had come out,<br />
					I stood in one garment<br />
					drying my limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a monk approached me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, reverend sir,<br />
					was it after concentrating his whole mind<br />
					that Devadatta was declared by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br />
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br />
					unpardonable is Devadatta" -<br />
					or was it from some deva-source?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I responded:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It was even as the Exalted One has declared.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(Then said the Exalted One:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'Either, Ānanda,<br />

					not long gone forth,<br />
					or if an elder,<br />
					a witless one.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, when I have definitely declared it,<br />
					can there be an alternative?</p>

					<p class="f4">I know not another person<br />
					of whom this was declared by me,<br />
					after full mental concentration,<br />
					save of Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so long, Ānanda,<br />
					as I saw a bright spot<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> in Devadatta,<br />
					even the prick-end of a horse-hair<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> in size,<br />
					I declared not:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br />
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br />
					unpardonable is Devadatta!"</p>

					<p class="f4">but it was when I saw none, that I declared:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gone wayward,<br />
					hell-bound for a kalpa,<br />
					unpardonable is Devadatta!"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Imagine,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> Ānanda,<br />
					a cesspool,<br />
					of a man's depth,<br />

					and a man fallen in,<br />
					head and all -<br />
					though a man appear,<br />
					ready to help,<br />
					to do the friendly,<br />
					to set him in safety,<br />
					to lift him out;<br />
					yet were he to go all round that cesspool,<br />
					he would not see<br />

					unsmeared with dung<br />
					by whieh to grasp<br />
					and lift him out.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is even so with Devadatta, Ānanda,<br />
					when I saw not a bright spot in him -<br />
					not even the prick-end of a horse-hair in size -<br />
					then I declared:</p>

							<p>Mark iv, 1: <span class="f2">... And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth ... And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. And he said unto them ... The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit ...</span><br />
