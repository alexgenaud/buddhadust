					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, for the renunciation of indolence<br />
					six things ought to be made to become.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought of impermanence,<br />
					the thought of the ill therein,<br />
					the thought of there being no self in ill,<br />
					the thought of renunciation,<br />
					the thought of dispassion<br />
					the thought of ending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, for the renunciation of indolence<br />
					these six things ought to be made to become.'</p>
