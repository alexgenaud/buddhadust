					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a>,<br />
					on Mount Vulture Peak,<br />
					the venerable Sona<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> dwelt on Cool Wood<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Sona,<br />
					in solitude apart,<br />
					communed thus in his heart:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Exalted one's disciples live in active energy<br />
					and I am one of them;<br />
					yet my heart is not detached<br />

					<p class="f4">My family is rich<br />

					what if I were to forsake the training<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br />
					knowing in his own heart<br />
					the venerable Sona's thoughts<br />
					— as a strong man might stretch his bent arm<br />
					or bend his stretched arm —<br />
					left Mount Vulture Peak<br />
					and appeared in Cool Wood<br />
					before the venerable Sona.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when <a id="pg267"><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span></a> his seat was ready,<br />
					the Exalted One sat down;<br />
					and the venerable Sona,<br />
					after saluting,<br />
					also sat down — at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One said to him, so seated:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sona, did you not thus commune in your heart:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Exalted one's disciples live in active energy<br />
					and I am one of them;<br />
					yet my heart is not detached<br />
					and free of the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And bethink you, Sona,<br />
					when your lute's strings were over-strung,<br />
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, indeed, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'And bethink you, Sona,<br />
					when your lute's strings were over-lax,<br />
					was your lute then tuneful and playable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, indeed, lord.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'But when, Sona,<br />
					your lute's strings were neither over-strung<br />
					nor over-lax,<br />
					but keyed to the middle pitch,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Sona,<br />

					ends in flurry,<br />
					when over-lax,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Sona,<br />
					stand fast in the mean<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> of energy;<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> 'Yes, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One,<br />
					after charging the venerable Sona with this counsel<br />
					— as a strong man might bend his arm to and fro —<br />
					left Cool Wood<br />

					<p class="f4">And presently<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> the venerable Sona stood fast in the mean of energy;<br />
					pierced the mean in the faculties;<br />
					and grasped therein the mark;<br />
					and living alone, secluded,<br />
					earnest, ardent, resolute,<br />
					entered and abode, not long after,<br />
					here amid things seen,<br />
					by his own power,<br />
					in the realization of that end above all<br />
					of the godly life,<br />
					for the sake of which<br />
					clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life;<br />
					and he knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Sona<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having won to arahantship,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Suppose I visit the Exalted One<br />
					and declare gnosis<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> near him!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him, and sat down at one side;<br />
					and so seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the arahant monk<br />
					who has destroyed the cankers,<br />
