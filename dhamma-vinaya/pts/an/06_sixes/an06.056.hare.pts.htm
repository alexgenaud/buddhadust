					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at that time<br />
					the venerable Phagguna was sick,<br />
					ailing,<br />
					very ill;<br />
					and the venerable Ānanda<br />
					went to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted,<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the venerable Phagguna is sick,<br />
					ailing,<br />
					very ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good were it, lord,<br />
					if the Exalted One<br />
					were to go and see the venerable Phagguna<br />
					out of compassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the evening,<br />
					after he had come from solitude,<br />
					the Exalted One visited the venerable Phagguna.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Phagguna saw him coming,<br />
					when he was some way off,<br />
					and stirred<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> on his bed;<br />
					but the Exalted One spoke to him and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enough, Phagguna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stir not on your bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there not these seats<br />
					here prepared already?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sat down<br />
					on the seat prepared.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated,<br />
					the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I hope, Phagguna, you're bearing up,<br />
					keeping going;<br />
					that vour aches and pains grow less,<br />
					not more;<br />
					that there are signs of their growing less,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					not more?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I can neither bear up<br />
					nor keep going;<br />
					my aches and pains grow grievously more,<br />
					not less;<br />
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br />
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> the violent ache<br />
					that racks my head<br />
					is just as though some lusty fellow<br />
					chopped at it with a sharp-edged sword;<br />
					<a id="pg271"><span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span></a> lord, I can neither bear up<br />
					nor keep going;<br />
					my pains grow more,<br />
					not less;<br />
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br />
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the violent pain in my head<br />
					is just as though some lusty fellow<br />
					clapped a stout leather strap about it;<br />
					lord, I cannot bear up<br />
					nor keep going;<br />
					my pains grow more,<br />
					not less;<br />
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br />
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the violent stab<br />
					that shoots through my stomach<br />
					is just as though a skilful butcher<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					gutted it with a carving knife;<br />
					lord, I cannot bear up<br />
					nor keep going;<br />
					my pains grow more,<br />
					not less;<br />
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br />
					not less.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, the fever of my body<br />
					is just as though a couple of lusty fellows<br />
					had seized a weakling by his limbs<br />
					and toasted him<br />
					and roasted him<br />
					over a fire-pit;<br />
					lord, I cannot bear bear up<br />
					nor keep going;<br />
					my pains grow more,<br />
					not less;<br />
					and there are signs of their growing more,<br />
					not less.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One instructed him,<br />
					roused him,<br />
					gladdened him<br />
					and comforted him<br />
					with Dhamma-talk,<br />
					then rose from his seat<br />
					and departed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now not long after the Exalted One's departure,<br />
					the venerable Phagguna died;<br />
					and at the time of his death<br />
					his faculties were completely purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then went the venerable Ānanda<br />
					to the Exalted One,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, not long after the Exalted One left,<br />
					the venerable Phagguna died;<br />
					and at that time<br />
					his faculties were completely purified.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But why, Ānanda,<br />
					should not the faculties of the monk, Phagguna,<br />
					have been completely purified?</p>

					<p class="f4">The monk's mind, Ānanda,<br />
					had<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> not been wholly freed<br />
					from the five lower fetters;<br />
					but, when he heard that Dhamma teaching,<br />
					his mind was wholly freed.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six advantages, Ānanda,<br />
					in hearing Dhamma in time,<br />
					in testing its goodness in time.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, Ānanda, the monk<br />
					whose mind is not wholly freed<br />
					from the five lower fetters,<br />
					but, when dying,<br />
					is able to see the Tathāgata:<br />
					the Tathāgata teaches him Dhamma,<br />
					lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely in the end,<br />
					its goodness,<br />
					its significance;<br />
					and makes known the godly life,<br />
					<a id="pg272"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span></a> wholly fulfilled,<br />
					perfectly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has heard that Dhamma teaching,<br />
					his mind is wholly freed<br />
					from the five lower fetters.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Ānanda,<br />
					is the first advantage<br />
					in hearing Dhamma in time,<br />
					in testing its goodness in time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, Ānanda, the monk<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, Ānanda, the monk<br />

					<p class="f4">Then is his mind wholly freed<br />

					<p class="f4">And as he does so,<br />
