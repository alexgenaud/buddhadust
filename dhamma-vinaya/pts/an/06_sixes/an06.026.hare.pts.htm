Maha Kaccana praises the the Buddha's exposition of the six establishments of further memory: recollection of the Buddha, Dhamma, Saŋgha, one's own ethical conduct, one's generosity, and to reflect on the fact that it is by these means that the various Gods have become such as they are and further it is by these means some attain Nibbāna." />

					<p class="f4">Once the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/maha_kaccana.htm">Mahā Kaccāna</a> was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the venerable Mahā Kaccāna addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, reverend sirs!.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reverend sir!' they rejoined;<br />
					and the venerable one said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> is wonderful, reverend sirs;<br />
					it is amazing<br />

					win truth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					realize Nibbāna -<br />
					I mean the six states of ever minding.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider, reverend sirs, the Ariyan disciple who is ever minding the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened,<br />
					perfected in knowledge and way of life,<br />
					one well-gone,<br />
					a knower of the worlds,<br />
					none higher,<br />
					a tamer of tamable men,<br />
					a teacher,<br />
					the awake among devas and men,<br />
					the Exalted One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he so minds him,<br />
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br />
					nor hate-obsessed,<br />
					nor obsessed by infatuation;<br />
					upright in heart is he at that time,<br />
					moved,<br />
					freed,<br />
					raised from greed;<br />
					and this greed, monks,<br />
					is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures;<br />
					and, sirs, that Ariyan disciple<br />
					lives at all times<br />
					with heart spacious,<br />
					large,<br />
					lofty,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					free of hatred and ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, reverend sirs,<br />
					by making this thought their object,<br />
					some men thereby become pure in nature.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br />
					a view for this life,<br />
					nor for this only,<br />
					bidding come and see,<br />
					a guide,<br />
					to be known by the wise<br />
					each for himself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Order:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Exalted One's Order of disciples<br />
					has rightly stepped the way,<br />
					has straightly stepped the way,<br />
					has fitly stepped the way,<br />
					has wholly stepped the way,<br />
					that is:<br />
					the four pairs among men,<br />
					the eight persons among mankind;<br />
					and this Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br />
					is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the virtues in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are unbroken,<br />

					and are praised by wise men;<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds liberality in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is indeed a gain for me,<br />
					indeed I have greatly gained,<br />
					I who among folk, overwhelmed by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					live the home-life heart-free of the stingy taint,<br />
