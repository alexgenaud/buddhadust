					at Jeta Grove,<br />

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk who follows six things is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />

					the world's peerless field for merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, herein a monk experiences psychic power in manifold <a id="pg203"><span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span></a> modes -</p>

					<p class="f4">Being one,<br />

					through mountains,<br />
					as if they were but air;<br />
					he dives in and out of the earth,<br />
					as if it were but water;<br />
					he walks on water<br />
					without parting it,<br />
					as if it were earth;<br />
					he travels cross-legged through the air,<br />
					as a bird on the wing;<br />
					he handles and strokes the moon and the sun,<br />
					though they be so powerful and strong;<br />
					he scales the heights of the world<br />
					even in this body -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
