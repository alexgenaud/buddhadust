					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, lord, a monk, aloof from sensuous appetites,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />

					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This state of ever minding, lord,<br />
					thus made become,<br />
					thus made to increase,<br />
					leads to dwelling at ease here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					<p class="f4">Free from the zest for joy,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, he concentrates<br />
					on the thought of light,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					fixes his mind on the thought of day -<br />
					as by day,<br />

					upwards from the soles of his feet,<br />
