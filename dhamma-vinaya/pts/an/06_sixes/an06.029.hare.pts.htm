					<p class="f4">What five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, lord, a monk, aloof from sensuous appetites,<br />
					aloof from evil ideas,<br />
					enters and abides in the first musing,<br />
					wherein applied and sustained thought works,<br />
					which is born of solitude<br />
					and is full of joy and ease.</p>

					and there the mind becomes calm and one-pointed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This state of ever minding, lord,<br />
					thus made become,<br />
					thus made to increase,<br />
					leads to dwelling at ease here now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					<p class="f4">Free from the zest for joy,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					he enters and abides in the <a id="pg228"><span class="f2 g"><b>[228]</b></span></a> third musing<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					and experiences in his being<br />
					that ease whereof the Ariyans declare:<br />
					'He that is tranquil and mindful dwells at ease'.</p>

					<p class="f4">This state of ever minding, lord,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, he concentrates<br />
					on the thought of light,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					fixes his mind on the thought of day -<br />
					as by day,<br />

					as by night,<br />
					so by day -<br />
					thus with mind neither hampered nor hindered,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, he considers this body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn3" href="#edn3">ed3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					upwards from the soles of his feet,<br />
					downwards from the hair of his head,<br />
					as skin-bound,<br />

					<p class="f4">There is in this body<br />
