					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">A brāhman,<br />
					approached the Exalted One,<br />
					greeted him<br />
					and, after exchanging the usual compliments,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say, sir,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhamma's for this life,<br />
					Dhamma's for this life!"</p>

					<p class="f4">But how, sir, is Dhamma for this life,<br />
					for other worlds,<br />
					bidding "Come see,"<br />
					leading onwards,<br />
					knowable to the wise by its relation to self?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, brāhman,<br />
					I will just question you in turn about this;<br />
