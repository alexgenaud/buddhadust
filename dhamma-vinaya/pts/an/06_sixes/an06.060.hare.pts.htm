<meta name="description" content="E. M. Hare's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Sixes, Sutta 60. Citta Hatthisariputta keeps interrupting the discourse of higher Dhamma by two elders and when told not to do so is defended by his friends who call him a wise bhikkhu capable of such a discussion. Maha Kotthita gently explains to them that although this bhikkhu has attained certain very high states of samadhi, he is nevertheless still world-bound and will soon leave the order. This happens and the bhikkhus are impressed and tell the Buddha who then tells them that Citta will soon tire of the worldly life and again join the order. And this too happens and Citta becomes an arahant." />
