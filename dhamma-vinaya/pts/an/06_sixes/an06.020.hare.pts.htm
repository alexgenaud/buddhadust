					<p class="f4">Once, when the Exalted One was staying in the Brick Hall at Nadika,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Lord,'they replied;<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, mindfulness of death,<br />

					<p class="f4">How so, monks is mindfulness of death,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">-&#9702;-</p>

					<p class="f4">Consider the monk who,<br />
