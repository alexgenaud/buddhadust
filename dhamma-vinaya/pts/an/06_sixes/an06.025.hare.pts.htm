					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these six states of ever minding.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What six?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Tathāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is the Exalted One,<br />
					arahant,<br />
					fully enlightened,<br />
					perfected in knowledge and way of life,<br />
					one well-gone,<br />
					a knower of the worlds,<br />
					none higher,<br />
					a tamer of tamable men,<br />
					a teacher,<br />
					the awake among devas and men,<br />
					the Exalted One!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, what time the Ariyan disciple minds the Tathāgata,<br />
					his heart is not lust-obsessed,<br />
					nor hate-obsessed,<br />
					nor obsessed by infatuation;<br />
					upright in heart is he at that time,<br />
					moved,<br />
					freed,<br />
					raised from greed;<br />
					and this greed, monks,<br />
					is a name for the fivefold sensuous pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, monks, by making this thought their object,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well declared by the Exalted One is Dhamma,<br />
					a view for this life,<br />
					nor for this only,<br />
					bidding come and see,<br />
					a guide,<br />
					to be known by the wise<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the Order:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Exalted One's Order of disciples<br />
					has rightly stepped the way,<br />
					has straightly stepped the way,<br />
					has fitly stepped the way,<br />
					has wholly stepped the way,<br />
					that is:<br />
					the four pairs among men,<br />
					the eight persons among mankind;<br />
					and this Order of disciples of the Exalted One<br />
					is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					worthy of oblations,<br />
					meet to be reverently saluted,<br />
					the world's peerless field for merit."</p>

					some men thereby are purged.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds the virtues in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are unbroken,<br />
					without a flaw,<br />
					spotless,<br />
					without blemish;<br />
					they bring freedom<br />
					and are praised by wise men;<br />
					they are incorruptible<br />
					and lead to concentration."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Ariyan disciple ever minds liberality in himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is indeed a gain for me,<br />
					indeed I have greatly gained,<br />
					I who among folk, overwhelmed by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					live the home-life heart-free of the stingy taint,<br />

					open-handād,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or the Ariyan diseiple ever minds the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are the Four Royal devas,<br />
					there are the devas of the Thirty,<br />
					the Yama devas,<br />
					the Tusita devas,<br />
					the devas who delight in creating,<br />
					the devas who have power over others' creations,<br />
					the Brahma-world devas,<br />
					and there are the devas beyond that;<br />
					because their faith was such,<br />
					those devas fared hence and arose there,<br />
					I also have such faith;<br />
					because their virtue was such,<br />
					those devas fared hence and arose there,<br />
					I also have such virtue;<br />
					because their learning was such,<br />
					those devas fared hence and arose there,<br />
					I also have such learning;<br />
