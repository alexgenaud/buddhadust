					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a>  Now, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					aloof from sense-desires,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters upon the first musing,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> its sweetness,<br />
					longs for it<br />
					and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein<br />
					and not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in the company of devas of the Brahmā-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">A kalpa, monks, is the life-span<br />
					of the devas of the Brahmā-group.<br />
					Therein the ordinary man stays<br />
					and spends his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br />
					then he goes to purgatory<br />
					or the womb of an animal,<br />
					he goes to the peta-realm.<br />
					But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br />
					after staying there<br />
					and spending his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas,<br />
					finally passes away in that same state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br />
					such the specific feature,<br />
					the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the unlearned ordinary man<br />
					in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					enters upon the second musing,<br />
					that calming of the inner self,<br />
					that one-pointedness of mind<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br />
					longs for it<br />
					and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein<br />
					and not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in the company of the Radiant devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of those devas is two kalpas.<br />
					Therein the ordinary man stays<br />
					and spends his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br />
					then he goes to purgatory<br />
					or the womb of an animal,<br />
					he goes to the peta-realm.<br />
					But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br />
					after staying there<br />
					and spending his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas,<br />
					finally passes away in that same state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br />
					such the specific feature,<br />
					the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the unlearned ordinary man<br />
					in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					by the fading out of zest,<br />
					disinterested,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					experiences in his  <a id="pg131"><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></a>  own person<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br />
					"He who is disinterested and alert<br />
					dwells at ease,"<br />
					— thus he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br />
					longs for it<br />
					and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein<br />
					and not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in the company of the Ever-radiant<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of those devas is four kalpas.<br />
					Therein the ordinary man stays<br />
					and spends his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br />
					then he goes to purgatory<br />
					or the womb of an animal,<br />
					he goes to the peta-realm.<br />

					finally passes away in that same state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br />
					such the specific feature,<br />
					the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the unlearned ordinary man<br />
					in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br />
					attains the fourth musing,<br />
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br />
					longs for it and finds happiness therein.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein<br />
					and not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in the company of the Vehapphala devas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life-span of the Vehapphala devas is five hundred kalpas.<br />
					Therein the ordinary man stays<br />
					and spends his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br />
					then he goes to purgatory<br />
					or the womb of an animal,<br />
					he goes to the peta-realm.<br />
					But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br />
					after staying there<br />
					and spending his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas,<br />
					finally passes away in that same state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br />
					such the specific feature,<br />
					the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the unlearned ordinary man<br />
					in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, then, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
