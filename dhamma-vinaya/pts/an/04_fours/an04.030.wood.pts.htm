					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> on Vultures' Peak Hill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a great number of notable Wanderers<br />
					were in residence<br />
					on the bank of the Snake river,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the Wanderers' Park,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">the Wanderers Annabhara,<br />
					Varadhara,<br />
					Sakuludayin<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and other notable Wanderers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at eventide the Exalted One,<br />
					arising from his solitary <a id="pg33"><span class="f2 g"><b>[33]</b></span></a> musing,<br />
					went towards the bank of Snake river,<br />
					where was the Wanderers' Park,<br />
					and on reaching it<br />
					sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to those Wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wanderers, these four factors of Dhamma,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-coveting, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not-malice, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right mindfulness, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right concentration, wanderers, is a factor of Dhamma,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four factors of Dhamma,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Here and for the followings Bhk. Bodhi's understanding would make better sense: "If anyone should say: 'I will reject this Dhamma factor of ~ and point out a [real] ascetic of brahmin who has a mind of ~ (the negative factors)..." Woodward's translation has Gotama proposing an argument that is so simple-minded as to be disrespectful. Unlikely.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br />
					though he has realized<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> this Dhamma-factor of not-coveting,<br />
					is nevertheless covetous,<br />
					strongly passionate in his desires," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br />
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br />
					it is a thing impossible<br />
					that such a recluse or brahmin,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of not-coveting,<br />
					could be pointed to as covetous,<br />
					strongly passionate in his desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of not-malice,<br />
					is yet malevolent of heart,<br />
					of corrupt thoughts," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br />

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br />
					it is a thing impossible<br />
					that such an one,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of not-malice,<br />
					could be pointed to as malevolent of heart,<br />
					as of corrupt thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br />
					is nevertheless distracted and uncontrolled," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br />
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br />
					it is a thing impossible<br />
					that such an one,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br />
					could be pointed to<br />
					as distracted and uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Wanderers, if one should thus object:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I could point to a recluse or brahmin who,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right concentration,<br />
					is nevertheless not concentrated but flighty-minded," -</p>

					<p class="f4">of such an one I would say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then let him speak out!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him utter speech,<br />
					and I shall behold his excellence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers,<br />
					it is a thing impossible<br />
					that such an one,<br />
					though he has realized this Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br />
					could be pointed to<br />
					as not concentrated but flighty-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> Now, Wanderers, whoso should think<br />
					he ought to censure and despise<br />
					these four Dhamma-factors<br />
					of not-coveting,<br />
					not-malice,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration, -<br />
					I say that in this very life<br />
					four righteous reproaches,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					occasions for censure,<br />
					come upon that man.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">If your reverence despises,<br />
					censures the Dhamma-factor of not-coveting,<br />
					then (it follows that) those recluses and brahmins who are covetous,<br />
					strongly passionate in desires,<br />
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br />
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your reverence censures,<br />
					despises the Dhamma-factor of not-malice,<br />
					then (it follows) that those recluses and brahmins who are malevolent of heart,<br />
					corrupt in thought,<br />
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br />
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your reverence censures,<br />
					despises the Dhamma-factor of right mindfulness,<br />
					then (it follows that) those recluses and brahmins who are distracted and uncontrolled<br />
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br />
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if your reverence censures,<br />
					despises the Dhamma-factor of right concentration,<br />
					then (it follows that) those recluses and brahmins who are not concentrated<br />
					but flighty-minded<br />
					must be honoured by your reverence,<br />
					must be praised by your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, Wanderers, whosoever<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> should think he ought to censure and despise<br />
					these four factors of Dhamma,<br />
					I say that in this very life<br />
					these four righteous reproaches,<br />
					occasions for censure,<br />
					come upon that man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, Wanderers, even, the men of Ukkala,<br />
					Vassa and Bhanna,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who were deniers of the cause,<br />
					deniers of the deed,<br />
					deniers of reality, -<br />
					even they did not judge it fit<br />
					to censure and despise<br />
					these four Dhamma-factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they feared blame,<br />
					attack,<br />
					reproach.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg35"><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span></a> Without ill-will and mindful ever,<br />
							Who in the self <i>(ajjhattaɱ)</i> is well composed,<br />
