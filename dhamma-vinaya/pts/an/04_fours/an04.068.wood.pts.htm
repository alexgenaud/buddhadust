							<p>There seems to me to be a problem here with Woodward's translation of <i>'parābhavāya'.</i> The plantain, bamboo, reed and mule are said to <i>'attavadhāya'</i> 'destruction of self' and <i>'parābhavāya'</i>  Woodward's 'destruction of others'. That Devadatta brought about problems for others is obvious, but not so obvious is the harm done to others by these other things. PED just has 'destruction.' 'Others' is not found in the word or outside it. Bhk. Bodhi has 'to his own ruin and destruction' which looks to be the better translation. Maybe 'to his own ruin and general (para) destruction. The problem here is holding on to 'atta' as 'self'. (little joke).</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, the plantain gives fruit<br />
