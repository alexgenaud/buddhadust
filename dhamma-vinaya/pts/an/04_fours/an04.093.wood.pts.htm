					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br />
					but does not gain the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person<br />
					is one who gains the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things<br />
					but does not gain mental calm of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person<br />
					is one who gains neither mental calm of the self,<br />
					nor the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br />
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who gained<br />
					mental calm in himself,<br />
					but not the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things,<br />
					should make an effort to establish<br />
					mental calm in himself,<br />
					and attain the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some future time<br />
					he is one who has gained<br />
					mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who has gained<br />
					the higher wisdom of insight into things,<br />
					but not mental calm in himself,<br />
					should make an effort to establish<br />
					the higher wisdom of insight into things,<br />
					and attain mental calm in himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some future time<br />
					he is one who has gained<br />
					mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, he who has gained<br />
					neither mental calm in himself<br />
					nor the higher wisdom of insight into things<br />
					should put forth intense desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					exertion,<br />
					impulse,<br />
					unobstruction,<br />
					mindfulness<br />
					and attention<br />
					for the attainment of mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, when one's turban or head is ablaze,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the extinguishing thereof<br />
					one must put forth intense desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					exertion,<br />
					impulse,<br />
					unobstruction,<br />
					mindfulness<br />
					and attention,<br />
					even so must that person<br />
					put forth intense,<br />
					effort,<br />
					exertion,<br />
					impulse,<br />
					unobstruction,<br />
					mindfulness<br />
					and attention,<br />
					for the attainment of mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at some future time<br />
					he is one who has gained<br />
					mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, monks, he who has gained both<br />
					mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things<br />
					should make an effort to establish just those profitable states<br />
					and further to destroy the āsavas.</p>
