					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Fear of self-reproach,<br />
					fear of others' reproach,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					fear of punishment<br />
					and fear of the way of woe.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is fear of self-reproach?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to practise evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					would not the self reproach me<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					as to virtue therein?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br />
					scared by the fear of self-reproach,<br />
					he abandons the practice<br />
					of evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					and makes-to-grow the practice<br />
					of good conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					and carries about<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> a pure self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'fear of self-reproach.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is fear of others' reproach?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to practise evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					would not others <a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> reproach<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> me<br />
					as to virtue therein?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br />
					scared by the fear of others' reproach,<br />
					he abandons the practice<br />
					of evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					and makes-to-grow the practice<br />
					of good conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					and carries about a pure self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'the fear of others' reproach.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is fear of punishment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one beholds the rajahs seizing a bandit,<br />
					a miscreant,<br />
					and subjecting him to divers forms of punishment;<br />
					flogging him with whips,<br />
					with canes<br />
					or cudgels;<br />
					cutting off his hand,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					his foot,<br />
					hand and foot,<br />
					his ear,<br />
					nose,<br />
					ear and nose;<br />
					torturing him with the 'gruel-pot,'<br />
					with the 'chank-shave'<br />
					torturing him with 'Rahu's mouth,'<br />
					with the 'fire-garland,'<br />
					with the 'flaming hand,'<br />
					with the 'hay-twist,'<br />
					the 'bark-dress,'<br />
					with the 'antelope,'<br />
					with 'flesh-hooking,'<br />
					with the 'disc-slice,'<br />
					with the 'pickling process,'<br />
					with 'circling the pin,'<br />
					torturing him with the 'straw-mattress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they spray him with boiling oil,<br />
					give him as food to dogs,<br />
					spit him alive on a stake<br />
					and chop his head off.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to do such deeds<br />
					as those for which the rajahs seize a bandit,<br />
					a miscreant,<br />
					and so treat him to divers forms of punishment;<br />
					flogging him with whips,<br />
					with canes<br />
					or cudgels;<br />
					cutting off his hand,<br />
					his foot,<br />
					hand and foot,<br />
					his ear,<br />
					nose,<br />
					ear and nose;<br />
					torturing him with the 'gruel-pot,'<br />
					with the 'chank-shave'<br />
					torturing him with 'Rahu's mouth,'<br />
					with the 'fire-garland,'<br />
					with the 'flaming hand,'<br />
					with the 'hay-twist,'<br />
					the 'bark-dress,'<br />
					with the 'antelope,'<br />
					with 'flesh-hooking,'<br />
					with the 'disc-slice,'<br />
					with the 'pickling process,'<br />
					with 'circling the pin,'<br />
					torturing him with the 'straw-mattress'<br />
					or they spray him with boiling oil,<br />
					give him as food to dogs,<br />
					spit him alive on a stake<br />
					or chop his head off<br />
					they would surely treat me<br />
					to divers forms of punishment;<br />
					flogging me with whips,<br />
					with canes<br />
					or cudgels;<br />
					cutting off my hand,<br />
					my foot,<br />
					my hand and foot,<br />
					my ear,<br />
					nose,<br />
					my ear and nose;<br />
					torturing me with the 'gruel-pot,'<br />
					with the 'chank-shave'<br />
					torturing me with 'Rahu's mouth,'<br />
					with the 'fire-garland,'<br />
					with the 'flaming hand,'<br />
					with the 'hay-twist,'<br />
					the 'bark-dress,'<br />
					with the 'antelope,'<br />
					with 'flesh-hooking,'<br />
					with the 'disc-slice,'<br />
					with the 'pickling process,'<br />
					with 'circling the pin,'<br />
					torturing me with the 'straw-mattress'<br />
					or they would spray me with boiling oil,<br />
					give me as food to dogs,<br />
					spit me alive on a stake<br />
					or chop my head off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus scared by the fear of punishment<br />
					he goes not about plundering others' property.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'fear of punishment.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the fear of the way of woe?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who practises<br />
					evil conduct in body, speech and thought<br />
					there is a bad result in the life to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now if I were to practise<br />
					evil conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					should not I be reborn after death<br />
					in the waste,<br />
					the way of woe,<br />
					the downfall,<br />
					in purgatory?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br />
					scared by the fear of the way of woe<br />
					he abandons the practice<br />
					of evil conduct<br />
					and makes-to-grow<br />
					the practice of good conduct in body, speech and thought,<br />
					and carries about a pure self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the<br />
					'fear of the way of woe.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four fears."</p>
