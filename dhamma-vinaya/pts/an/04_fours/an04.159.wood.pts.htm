					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a certain nun<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> 'Come, thou good fellow!</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, a nun named so and so is sick,<br />

					<p class="f4">'And do you say this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be a good thing, sir,<br />

					out of compassion for her."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, lady,'replied that man,<br />
					and went to the venerable Ānanda and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda came to where she was,<br />
