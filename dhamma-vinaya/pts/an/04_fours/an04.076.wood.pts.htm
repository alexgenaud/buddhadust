					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kusinara">Kusinārā,</a><br />
					at the Bend,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the Sāl-grove of the Mallas,<br />
					between the twin sal-trees,<br />
					at the time of his final passing away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yea, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be, however, monks,<br />
					that some one of you has doubt or misgiving<br />
					as to the Buddha<br />
					or Dhamma<br />
					or Order<br />
					or the Way<br />
					or the Practice (going to the Way).</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not hereafter remorseful (at the thought):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Face to face with us was the Teacher<br />
					and we could not question the Exalted One face to face.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words those monks were silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time the Exalted One addressed the monks: :</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be, however, monks,<br />
					that some one of you has doubt or misgiving<br />
					as to the Buddha<br />
					or Dhamma<br />
					or Order<br />
					or the Way<br />
					or the Practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> Be not hereafter remorseful (at the thought):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Face to face with us was the Teacher<br />
					and we could not question the Exalted One face to face.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words those monks were silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for the third time the Exalted One addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It may be, however, monks,<br />
					that some one of you has doubt or misgiving<br />
					as to the Buddha<br />
					or Dhamma<br />
					or Order<br />
					or the Way<br />
					or the Practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask, monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">Be not hereafter remorseful (at the thought):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Face to face with us was the Teacher<br />
					and we could not question the Exalted One face to face.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words those monks were silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It may be, however, monks, that out of respect for the teacher ye ask not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then let one ask as friend of a friend.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At these words those monks were silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus convinced am I of the Order of monks<br />
					that there is not in this Order of monks<br />
					in a single monk<br />
					any doubt or misgiving<br />
					as to the Buddha,<br />
					Dhamma,<br />
					the Order,<br />
					the Way<br />
					or the Practice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'You, Ānanda, speak out of faith,<br />
					but the Tathāgata has knowledge therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is indeed in this Order of monks<br />
					no doubt or misgiving<br />
					in a single monk<br />
					as to the Buddha,<br />
					the Order,<br />
					Dhamma,<br />
					the Way,<br />
					or the Practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these five hundred monks here, Ānanda,<br />
					the most backward<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is a Stream-winner,<br />
					one saved from the Downfall,<br />
					assured,<br />
					bound for enlightenment.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Upavattana</i> (branching off), so always, but at <i>DA.</i> i, <i>Upavattam Mallānaṃ.</i> It is not the name of a place proper. <i>Comy.</i> 'At a place midway between the eastward row of sāl-trees where it turns northward.' <i>UdA.</i> 238; <i>SA.</i> i, 222, <i>uttarena nivattati; tasmā upavattanan ti vucoati.</i> <i>Cf.</i> also <i>DA.</i> ii, 573.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The meaning here is obvious, but <i>Comy.</i> says 'Ask each other, as friend of friend, and I will solve your doubts,' which seems a strained interpretation. See Gotama the Man, 246-50.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Pacchimaka.</i> <i>Comy.</i> thinks this refers to Ānanda, and was said to encourage him to persevere, but this is open to doubt. It is improbable, also, that a large number of monks was present.</p>
