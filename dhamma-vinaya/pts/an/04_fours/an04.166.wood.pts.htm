Four paths to the eradication of the corrupting influences: the unpleasant slow path to higer knowledge; the unpleasant fast path to higher knowledge, the pleasant slow path to higher knowledge, and the pleasant swift path to higher knowledge. The factors of unpleasantness and slowness are considered less than advantageous while those factors of pleasantness and speed are considered advantageous."/>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The mode of progress that is painful<br />
					with sluggish intuition,<br />
					the mode of progress that is painful<br />
					with swift intuition,<br />
					the mode of progress that is pleasant<br />
					with sluggish intuition,<br />
					and the mode of progress that is pleasant<br />
					and accompanied with swift intuition.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now here, monks, the mode of progress that is painful<br />
					with sluggish intuition<br />
					is reckoned low<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> in both respects,<br />
					both as regards its pain<br />
					and its sluggishness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how it is reckoned low in both respects.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br />
					the mode of progress that is painful<br />
					with swift intuition<br />
					is reckoned low in respect of its being painful.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br />
					the mode of progress that is pleasant<br />
					with sluggish intuition<br />
					is reckoned low in respect of its being sluggish.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, monks, the mode of progress that is pleasant<br />
					with swift intuition<br />
					is reckoned excellent in both respects,<br />
					both as regards its pleasantness<br />
					and its swiftness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is reckoned excellent in both respects.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>
