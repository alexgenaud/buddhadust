					<i>[aloof from unprofitable states of mind,]</i> or<br />
					<i>[aloof from evil conditions]</i><br />
					attains the first musing<br />
					<i>[which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />

					<p class="f4">by the calming down of thought directed and sustained ...<br />
					<i>[he enters on that inward calm,<br />
					that single-minded purpose,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />

					<p class="f4">by the fading out of zest ...<br />
					<i>[he becomes balanced and<br />
					remains mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences with the body<br />
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:<br />
					"The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily," and]</i><br />
					he attains the third musing;</p>

					<p class="f4">by rejecting pleasure and pain alike ...<br />
					<i>[by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,]</i><br />
					he attains the fourth musing<br />
					<i>[free of pain and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity<br />
					of balance and equanimity.]</i> <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
