					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Possessed of four qualities, monks,<br />
					a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br />
					is worthy of the rajah,<br />
					is the rajah's possession,<br />
					is reckoned an asset of the rajah.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a rajah's noble, thoroughbred steed<br />
					is possessed of beauty,<br />
					strength,<br />
					speed<br />
					and good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br />

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks,<br />
					possessed of four qualities<br />
					a monk is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of hospitality,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk has beauty (of life),<br />strength (of characteɱ,<br />
					speed (of insight)<br />
					and good proportions (of necessaries).</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of beauty?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is virtuous,<br />
					he lives restrained with the restraint of the obligations,<br />
					is proficient in the practice of good conduct,<br />
					seeing danger in the slightest faults<br />
					he trains himself in the precepts<br />
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has beauty (of life).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of strength?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives ardent in energy,<br />
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br />
					to acquire good qualities,<br />
					strenuously exerting himself,<br />
					not throwing off the burden in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has strength (of character).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of speed?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					attains the heart's release,<br />
					the release by wisdom<br />
					that ie without the āsavas,<br />
					in this very life<br />
					of himself thoroughly comprehending it,<br />
					and abides therein.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a monk is possessed of speed (of insight).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk possessed of good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk is one<br />
					who gets robe and alms-food,<br />

					extras and necessary medicines<br />
					for use in sickness.</p>
