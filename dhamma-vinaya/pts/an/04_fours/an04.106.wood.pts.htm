					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four mangoes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unripe which looks ripe,<br />
					the ripe which looks unripe,<br />
					<a id="pg113"><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span></a> the unripe which looks unripe,<br />
					and the ripe which looks ripe.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four mangoes.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, there are these four persons<br />
					resembling mangoes<br />
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unripe which looks ripe,<br />
					the ripe which looks unripe,<br />
					the unripe which looks unripe,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person unripe but ripe-looking?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the mien of a certain person<br />
					is charming,<br />
					whether he be departing or approaching,<br />
					looking forward or backward,<br />
					bending or unbending (his arm),<br />
					or bearing outer robe,<br />
					bowl<br />
					and (ordinary) robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br />

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>
