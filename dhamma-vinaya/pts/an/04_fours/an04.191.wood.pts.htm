					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, four advantages are to be looked for<br />
					from the frequent verbal practice<br />
					of teachings heard with the ear,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					from considering them in the mind,<br />
					from thoroughly penetrating them by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākarana, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhu-tadhamma</i> and <i>Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Those teachings heard with the ear,<br />
					often practised verbally,<br />
					considered by the mind,<br />
					are thoroughly penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">He making an end<br />
					with <a id="pg194"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span></a> memory confused<br />
					is reborn in a certain company of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the happy ones<br />
					recite to him Dhamma-verses.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Slow to arise in him, monks,<br />
					is memory,<br />
					but that being very quickly reaches excellencc.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first advantage to be looked for<br />
					from the frequent verbal practice<br />

					from considering them by the mind,<br />

					one who has won mastery of mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is teaching Dhamma to a company of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, this is just<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> the Dhamma-discipline<br />
					according to which<br />
					formerly I practised the God-life!</p>

					is memory,<br />
					but that being very quickly reaches excellence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					while going along the highroad,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					should hear the sound of a drum.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would have no doubt or uncertainty<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> It is just as if two playmates<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> who used to play at mud-pies together were to meet some time or other.</p>
