					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin Doṇa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> was also journeying along the highroad between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setabbya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Doṇa, beheld on the footprints of the Exalted One the wheel-marks<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> with their thousand spokes, with their rims and hubs and all their attributes complete.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing these he thought thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful indeed! It is marvellous indeed! These will not be the footprints of one in human form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then the Exalted One stepped aside from the highroad and sat down at the root of a certain tree, sitting cross-legged, holding his body upright and setting up mindfulness in front of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Doṇa, following up the Exalted One's footprints, beheld the Exalted One seated at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him comely, faith-inspiring,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> with senses calmed, tranquil of mind, in the attainment of composure by masterly control, (like) a tamed, alert, perfectly trained<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> elephant,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> he approached the Exalted One and drawing near to him said this:</p>

							<p>Bhk. Thanissaro's solution here is that this is a manner of speech. I would only express it slightly differently as a contracted form of: "Will you be being about being a ..." From the perspective of the awakened mind there is actually no true 'present' to base a present tense upon in the case of asking a person what he is in the present. Things are under constant change, so a being is always about becoming something. There should really be a special tense for this case: The present-future or the future-present.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Bhavissati.</i> This passage has hitherto been mistranslated. The brahmin does not ask 'Are you?' but uses the future tense common to the verbs be and become. The Buddha replies, not 'I am not (these things),' but 'shall not become,' also using the future. The gāthas clearly imply that he will not again 'become' any one of these creatures, having destroyed the basis of rebirth; nor do they hint at any supernatural or superhuman marks or appearance. Probably the sentence about the 'wheels,' as well as the last prose paragraph, is a later insertion, being an editorial attempt to lend the plausibility of later values to a fragmentary, half-forgotten 'saying.' We meet with apparently the eame Doṇa, in the next Nipāta.</p>
