					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapndika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/mallika.htm">Mallikā</a> the queen<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she sat thus<br />
					Mallikā the queen<br />
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why in this world<br />
					some women-folk are ill-favoured,<br />
					deformed,<br />
					of a mean appearance,<br />
					and are poor,<br />
					having little of their own,<br />
					of small possessions<br />
					and are of small account?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, pray what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why in this world<br />
					some women-folk are ill-favoured,<br />
					deformed,<br />
					of a mean appearance,<br />
					but yet are wealthy,<br />
					of great riches,<br />
					of great possessions<br />
					and of great account?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, pray what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why in this world<br />
					some women-folk are well-favoured,<br />
					well-formed,<br />
					lovely to look upon,<br />
					amiable,<br />
					possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion,<br />
					and yet are poor,<br />

					<p class="f4">And yet again, lord, pray what is the reason,<br />

					some women-folk are well-favoured,<br />

					lovely to look upon,<br />
					amiable,<br />
					possessed of the greatest beauty of complexion,<br />
					and are moreover wealthy,<br />

					of great possessions<br />
					and of great account?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, Mallikā, a certain woman<br />
					is ill-tempered,<br />
					of a very irritable nature.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On very little provocation<br />
					she becomes cross and agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is upset and becomes stubborn,<br />
					she shows temper<br />
					and ill-will<br />
					and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">She is no giver of charity<br />

					respect,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					homage<br />

					<p class="f4">She is revengefull<br />
					and harbours a grudge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, if, deceasing from that life,<br />

					is ill-favoured,<br />
					ill-formed,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein again (in the second case), Mallikā,<br />

					<p class="f4">She is upset and becomes stubborn,<br />

					<p class="f4">However, she is not jealous-minded,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein again (in the third case), Mallikā,<br />
					a certain woman<br />

					<p class="f4">Even on great provocation<br />

					<p class="f4">She is not upset,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein again (in the fourth case), Mallikā,<br />

					<p class="f4">Moreover, she is a giver of charity<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, Mallikā, these are the reasons and causes<br />

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					queen Mallikā said this<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suppose, lord, that I<br />
					in another birth<br />
					was ill-tempered and of an irritable nature,<br />
					becoming cross and agitated<br />
					even on slight provocation;<br />
					that I became upset thereat and stubborn,<br />
					showed ill-will and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same I<br />
					(might now be) ill-favoured,<br />
					ill-formed<br />
					and of mean appearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, lord, that in another birth<br />
					I gave gifts of charity<br />
					to recluse and brahmin<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothing,<br />
					vehicle,<br />
					flowers,<br />
					scent,<br />
					ointment,<br />
					bed,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and light,<br />
					that same I<br />
					now might be wealthy,<br />
					of great riches,<br />
					of great possessions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, lord, that in another birth<br />
					I was not jealous-minded,<br />
					I was not jealous of other folk's gain,<br />
					nor of the honour,<br />
					respect,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					homage<br />
					and worship paid to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was not revengeful<br />
					nor did I harbour a grudge.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same I<br />
					am now of great account.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now again, lord, in this rajah's family<br />
					there are maids of the nobles,<br />
					maids of the brahmins<br />
					and of the householders too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Over them I hold supremacy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, from this day forth<br />
					I will indeed become good-tempered,<br />
					not irritable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even on great provocation<br />
					I will not become upset nor stubborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will not show ill-will<br />
					nor displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will give to recluse and brahmin<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothing,<br />
					vehicle,<br />
					flowers,<br />
					scent,<br />
					ointment,<br />
					bed,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and light.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will not become jealous-minded.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will not be jealous of <a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> other folk's gain,<br />
					nor of the honour,<br />

					<p class="f4">I will not be revengeful<br />
					nor will I harbour a grudge.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, lord,<br />
					one should raise the fallen<br />
					or show forth the hidden,<br />
					or point the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects,-<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					has dhamma been set forth by the worthy Gotama.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, may the Exalted One accept me<br />
					as a woman disciple<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life may last,<br />
