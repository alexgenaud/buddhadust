					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is bent, on his own profit,<br />
					not another's;<br />
					he who is bent on another's profit,<br />
					not his own;<br />
					he who is bent on the profit of both;<br />
					he who is bent on the profit of neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					bent on his own profit, not another's?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person,<br />
					as regards himself,<br />
					abstains from killing,<br />
					but does not incite another to do so;<br />
					as regards himself,<br />
					abstains from stealing,<br />
					but does not incite another to do so;<br />
					as regards himself,<br />
					abstains from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br />
					but does not incite another to do so;<br />
					as regards himself,<br />
					abstains from lying,<br />
					but does not incite another to do so;<br />
					as regards himself,<br />
					abstains from liquor fermented and distilled,<br />
					but does not incite another so to abstain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent on his own profit,<br />
					not another's</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					bent on another's profit,<br />
					not his own?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br />
					does not himself<br />
					abstain from killing,<br />
					but does incite another to do so;<br />
					does not himself,<br />
					abstain from stealing,<br />
					but does incite another to do so;<br />
					does not himself,<br />
					abstain from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br />
					but does incite another to do so;<br />
					does not himself,<br />
					abstain from lying,<br />
					but does incite another to do so;<br />
					does not himself,<br />
					abstain from liquor fermented and distilled,<br />
					but does incite another so to abstain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person bent on another's profit,<br />
					not his own</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent<br />
					neither on his own<br />
					nor on another's profit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br />
					neither himself abstains<br />
					nor incites another to abstain from killing<br />
					neither himself abstains<br />
					nor incites another to abstain from stealing,<br />
					neither himself abstains<br />
					nor incites another to abstain from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br />
					neither himself abstains<br />
					nor incites another to abstain from lying,<br />
					neither himself abstains<br />
					nor incites another to abstain from liquor fermented and distilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent<br />
					neither on his own<br />
					nor on another's profit</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent<br />
					both on his own profit<br />
					and another's?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br />
					both himself abstains from killing<br />
					and incites another to do so,<br />
					both himself abstains from stealing,<br />
					and incites another to do so,<br />
					both himself abstains from from wrong conduct in sense-desires,<br />
					and incites another to do so,<br />
					both himself abstains from lying,<br />
					and incites another to do so,<br />
					both himself abstains from liquor fermented and distilled<br />
					and incites another to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent<br />
					both on his own profit<br />
					and another's</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
