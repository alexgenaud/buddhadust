<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 180. The Buddha tells the bhikkhus to determine whether or not a saying is to be considered as his word by comparing the phrases and their construction with the phrases and construction found in the Suttas and in the Vinaya. This is to be done even in the case of four great authorities: Someone who has reportedly heard a saying face-to-face with the Buddha; some Saŋgha with a reportedly learned elder; some reportedly learned Saŋgha; a single reportedly learned monk." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying in Bhoganagara<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at the Ānanda Shrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you these four great authorities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Carefully give your minds to it and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> 'And what, monks, are the four great authorities?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a monk might say:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Dhamma,<br />
