					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sapwood surrounded by sapwood,<br />
					sapwood surrounded by heartwood,<br />
					heartwood surrounded by sapwood,<br />
					and heart-wood surrounded by heartwood.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling trees<br />
					are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sapwood surrounded by sapwood,<br />
