					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, those families where mother and father<br />
					are worshipped in the home<br />
					are reckoned like unto Brahma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those families where mother and father<br />
					are worshipped in the home<br />
					are ranked with teachers of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those families where mother and father are worshipped in the home<br />
					are ranked with the devas<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> of old.</p>

					<p class="f4">Worthy of offerings, monks, are those families<br />
					where mother and father are worshipped in the home.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahma," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Teachers of old," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Devas of old," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Worthy of offerings," monks, is a term for mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because mother and father do much for children,<br />
					they bring them up,<br />
					nourish<br />
					and introduce them to the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Parents are "Brahma" called, "teachers of old,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Worthy of gifts are they, compassionate<br />
							Unto their tribe of children. Thus the wise<br />

							Serve them with food and drink, clothing and bed.<br />
							Anoint their bodies, bathe and wash their feet.<br />
