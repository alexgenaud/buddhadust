					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is bent, on his own profit,<br />
					not another's;<br />
					he who is bent on another's profit,<br />
					not his own;<br />
					he who is bent on the profit of neither;<br />
					he who is bent on the profit of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, monks, is a person bent on the profit of self,<br />
					not of another?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is quick to observe<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in teachings that are profitable,<br />
					has naturally a good memory<br />
					for teachings he has heard,<br />
					examines the meaning of teachings he has learned by heart,<br />
					and by understanding both the meaning and the letter thereof,<br />
					walks in accordance with Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet is he not possessed of a charming voice or delivery,<br />
					not possessed of urbane speech,<br />
					distinctly and clearly enunciated,<br />
					so as to make his meaning clear.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is he one to teach,<br />
					urge,<br />
					incite<br />
					and gladden his fellows in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is bent on the profit of self,<br />
					not of another.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on the profit of another,<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not quick to observe<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent on the profit of another,<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on neither his own nor another's profit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is not quick to observe<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent on neither his own nor another's profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person bent on the profit both of self and of another?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is quick to observe<br />
					in teachings that are profitable,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is bent on the profit both of self and of another</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
