					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.115.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/04_fours/an04.115.than.ati.htm#p1">than</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four occasions.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, monks, the occasion when action is unpleasant<br />
					and unprofitable to the doer;<br />
					that occasion when action is unpleasant<br />
					but profitable to the doer;<br />
					that occasion when action is pleasant<br />
					but unprofitable to the doer;<br />
					and the occasion when action is both pleasant<br />
					and profitable to the doer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, in the first instance,<br />
					in a case when action is both unpleasant<br />
					and unprofitable to the doer,<br />
					one deems action inadvisable for both reasons,<br />
					for it is both unpleasant and unprofitable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, in the second instance, that is,<br />
					when action is unpleasant<br />
					but profitable,<br />
					one may know who is a fool<br />
					and <a id="pg123"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span></a> who a wise man<br />
					in the matter of manly strength,<br />
					manly vigour<br />
					and energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, monks, the fool has no such consideration as this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though this is an occasion when action is unpleasant,<br />
					yet it is one which brings profit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly he does not act,<br />
					and his inaction brings him loss.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the wise man thus considers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though this is an occasion when action is unpleasant,<br />
					yet it brings profit to the doer.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly he acts,<br />
					and profit results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the third case<br />
					when action is pleasant<br />
					but unprofitable, -<br />
					in this case also one may know who is a fool<br />
					and who a wise man<br />
					in the matter of manly strength,<br />
					manly vigour<br />
					and energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, monks, the fool does not thus consider:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though this act is pleasant,<br />
					yet it brings loss.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly he acts<br />
					and the result is loss.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas the wise man thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though this act is pleasant,<br />
					yet its results bring loss.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he acts not<br />
					and the result is to his profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, monks, in the case<br />
					where action is both pleasant<br />
					and profitable,<br />
					one deems action advisable for both reasons,<br />
					for it is both pleasant and profitable;<br />
					that is why one deems action advisable.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four occasions (of action).'</p>
