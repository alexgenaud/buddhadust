<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 46. Gotama relates to the bhikkhus his conversation with the Deva Rohitassa who asks if it is possible to reach the end of the world where there is no more birth and aging and death and rebirth. Gotama explains that it is not possible to get to that end of the world by 'going' but it is not possible to make an end of birth and aging and death and rebirth without reaching the end of the world. The world, he says, the origin of this world, the end of this world, and the way to go to go to the end of this world is to be got by understanding this body with it's perceptions and thoughts." />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.046.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />
					at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when that night was spent<br />
					the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> 'Monks, this night Rohitassa of the devas,<br />
					when night was waning,<br />
					came to visit me,<br />
					lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with surpassing brilliance,<br />
					and on coming to me<br />
					stood at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So standing<br />
					Rohitassa of the devas said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, is it possible for us,<br />
					by going,<br />
					to know,<br />
					to see,<br />
					to reach world's end,<br />
					where there is no more being born<br />
					or growing old,<br />
					no more dying,<br />
					no more falling (from one existence)<br />
					and rising up (in another)"?</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, monks, I said this<br />
					to Rohitassa of the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Your reverence, where there is no more being born<br />
					or growing old,<br />
					no more dying,<br />
					no more falling from one existence<br />
					and rising up in another, -<br />
					I declare that that end of the world<br />
					is not by going to be known,<br />
					seen,<br />
					or reached."</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereupon, monks, Rohitassa of the devas<br />
					said this to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, lord,<br />
					how well it is said by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where there is no more being born<br />
					or growing old,<br />
					no more dying,<br />
					no more falling from one existence<br />
					and rising up in another, -<br />
					I declare that that end of the world<br />
					is not by going to be known,<br />
					seen,<br />
					or reached.'!</p>

					<p class="f4">Formerly, lord, I was the hermit called Rohitassa,<br />
					Bhoja's son,<br />
					one of psychic power,<br />
					a sky-walker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, lord, was my speed, -<br />
					just as if a stout bowman,<br />
					for instance,<br />
					a skilled archer,<br />
					a practised hand,<br />
					a trained man<br />
					could with a light shaft<br />
					shoot easily across a palm-tree's shadow, -<br />
					such was my speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">The extent of my stride<br />
					was as the distance between the eastern<br />
					and the western ocean.</p>

					<p class="f4">To me, lord, possessed of such speed<br />
					and of such a stride,<br />
					there came a longing thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will reach world's end<br />
					by going.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord, not to speak of (the time spent over)<br />
					food and drink,<br />
					eating,<br />
					tasting<br />
					and calls of nature,<br />
					not to speak of struggles<br />
					to banish sleep and weariness,<br />
					though my life-span was a hundred years,<br />
					though I lived a hundred years,<br />
					though I travelled a hundred years,<br />
					yet I reached not world's end<br />
					but died ere that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful indeed, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous it is, lord,<br />
					how well it has been said by the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your reverence, where there is no more being born<br />
					or growing old,<br />
					no more dying,<br />
					no more falling from one existence<br />
					and rising up in another, -<br />
					I declare that that end of the world<br />
					is not by going to be known,<br />
					seen,<br />
					or reached.'!</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, monks,<br />
					I said this to Rohitassa of the devas:</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, your reverence,<br />
					I declare not<br />
					that there is any making an end of Ill<br />
					without reaching world's end.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, your reverence,<br />
					in this very fathom-long body,<br />
					along with its perceptions and thoughts,<br />
					I proclaim the world to be,<br />
					likewise the origin of the world<br />
					and the making of the world to end,<br />
					likewise the practice going to the ending of the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Not to be reached by going is world's end.<br />
							Yet there is no release for man from Ill<br />
							Unless he reach world's end. Then let a man<br />
							Become world-knower, wise, world-ender,<br />
							Let him be one who liveth the God-life.<br />
							Knowing the world's end by becoming calmed<br />
							He longeth not for this world or another.'</p>
