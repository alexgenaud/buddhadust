					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The mode of progress that is impatient,<br />
					that which is patient,<br />
					that which tames,<br />
					and the mode of progress that calms.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the mode of progress that is impatient?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one<br />
					reviles again<br />
					him that reviles,<br />
					insults again<br />
					him that insults,<br />
					abuses again<br />
					him that abuses.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"the impatient mode of progress."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the patient mode of progress?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one<br />
					reviles not again,<br />
					him that reviles,<br />
					insults not again,<br />
					him that insults,<br />
					abuses not again<br />
					him that abuses.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"the patient mode of progress."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the mode of progress that tames?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who lives with the faculty of the eye uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to control of the faculty of eye,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br />
					attains control over the faculty of eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who lives with the faculty of the ear uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to control of the faculty of ear,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br />
					attains control over the faculty of ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he with the nose smells a scent,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who lives with the faculty of the nose uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to control of the faculty of nose,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of nose,<br />
					attains control over the faculty of nose.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he with the tongue <a id="pg158"><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></a> tastes a savour,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who lives with the faculty of the tongue uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to control of the faculty of tongue,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br />
					attains control over the faculty of tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he with body contacts tangibles,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who lives with the faculty of the body uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to control of the faculty of body,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of body,<br />
					attains control over the faculty of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with mind he cognizes mental states,<br />
					he is not misled by its outer view<br />
					nor by its lesser details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who lives with the faculty of the mind uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to control of the faculty of mind,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of mind,<br />
					attains control over the faculty of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"the mode of progress that tames."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the mode of progress that calms?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk admits not<br />
					sensual thinking that has arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons,<br />
					restrains,<br />
					calms it down,<br />
					makes an end of it,<br />
					forces it not to recur.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So also a monk admits not<br />
					malicious thinking that has arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons,<br />
					restrains,<br />
					calms it down,<br />
					makes an end of it,<br />
					forces it not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">So also a monk admits not<br />
					harmful thinking that has arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">He abandons,<br />
					restrains,<br />
					calms it down,<br />
					makes an end of it,<br />
					forces it not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not admit evil,<br />
					unprofitable states<br />
					that occur from time to time;<br />
					he abandons them,<br />
					restrains,<br />
					calms them down,<br />
					makes an end of them,<br />
					forces them not to recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					"the mode of progress that calms."</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>
