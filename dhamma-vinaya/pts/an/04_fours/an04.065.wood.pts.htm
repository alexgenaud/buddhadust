					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who measures according to (outward) form and is satisfied therewith;<br />
					he who measures according to (others') words and is satisfied therewith;<br />
					he who measures according to austerity and is satisfied therewith;<br />
					he who measures according to dhamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and is satisfied therewith.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If they have measured by the form and go by what folk say,<br />
							Desire-and-passion-led, they do not know that man.<br />
							If the very man he know not, nor things external see,<br />
							Hedged in on every side that fool by words is swayed.<br />
							If the very man he know not, but things external see,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The outward fruits observing, he too by words is swayed.<br />
							But if he know the very man and see externals too,<br />
							Clear-sighted without hindrance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> by words he is not swayed.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
