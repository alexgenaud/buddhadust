					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, on the manifestation of a Tathāgata,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					four wonderful, marvellous things<br />
					are manifested.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">When a Bodhisattva, deceasing from the Tusita-deva-group,<br />

					with its host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					of devas and mankind,<br />
					then an infinite,<br />
					glorious radiance is manifested,<br />
					surpassing the deva-majesty of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the gloom of space between the worlds,<br />

					the murk of darkness,<br />
					where even the radiance of our moon and sun,<br />
					though of such wondrous power and majesty,<br />
					cannot be manifested, -<br />
					even there an infinite,<br />
					glorious radiance is spread abroad,<br />
					surpassing the deva-majesty of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise those creatures that have come into being there,<br />
					becoming aware of each other through that radiance,<br />
					exclaim:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It seems, friends,<br />
					that there be other creatures also<br />
					that have come into being here."</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, on the manifestation of a Tathāgata,<br />
