					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, he who possesses not four qualities<br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who possesses not the Ariyan virtue<br />

					<p class="f4">He who possesses not the Ariyan release<br />

					<p class="f4">These are the four qualities<br />

					<p class="f4">But, monks, he who possesses these four qualities is said not to be fallen away from this Dhamma-discipline.</p>

Our <i>Comy.'s</i> interp. differs from that on <i>Thag.</i> (where birds of prey pounce, <i>patanti,</i> on fallen flesh (<i>cutā</i>) and pounce greedily again). Here, however, <i>Comy.</i> says: <i>Ye cutā, te patanti: ye patitā, te cutā: cutattā patitā, patitattā cutā ti attho.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> I quote Mrs. Rhys Davids's note on <i>Brethr. loc. cit.</i> '<i>i.e.,</i> says the Commentary (ascribed to Dhammapāla): "By the happiness of the <i>attainment</i> of fruition has Nibbāna, which is beyond happiness (or is exceeding great happiness, <i>accanta-sukhaɱ</i>), been won, and by that happiness of insight, which has become a happy mode of <i>procedure,</i> has the bliss of Fruition, of Nibbāna, been reached." The latter interpretation, as Dr. Neumann has pointed out - winning happiness by happiness - is, in the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.014.pali.bd.htm#pg93"><i>Majjhima-Nikāya</i> (i, 93 <i>f.</i>),</a> contrasted with the Jain point of view: "Nay, friend Gotama, happiness is not to be got at by happiness, but by suffering," - the ascetic standpoint <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/chlm/mn/mn.014.chlm.sbb.htm#pg68">(<i>cf. Further Dialogues,</i> i, 68)</a>.' Here our <i>Comy.</i> much less convincingly simply describes a series: 'By human happiness, heavenly happiness: by musing-happiness, the happiness of insight: by this, path-happiness: by path-happiness, fruition-happiness: by this, Nibbāna-happiness is won.'</p>
