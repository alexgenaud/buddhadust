					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four talkers of Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person talking Dhamma<br />
					says little<br />
					and that not to the point;<br />
					while his company is unskilled to judge<br />
					what is to the point<br />
					or otherwise.</p>

							<p>Bhkkhu Bodhi's reading of this sutta is much better:<br />
							One that talks little and that is off point with a following that is incompetent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker;<br />
							one that says much and that is off point with a following that is incompetent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker;<br />
							one that says little but that is on point and his company is competent to judge and so considers him a Dhamma-talker;<br />
