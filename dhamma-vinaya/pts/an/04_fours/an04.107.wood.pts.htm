					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four mice.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one that digs a hole<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> but does not live in it,<br />
					the one that lives in a hole it has not dug,<br />
					the one that neither digs a hole nor lives in a hole,<br />
					and the one that both digs a hole and lives in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four mice.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, there are these four persons resembling mice found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one that digs a hole but does not live in it,<br />
					the one that lives in a hole it has not dug,<br />
					the one that neither digs a hole nor lives in a hole,<br />
					and the one that both digs a hole and lives in it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person one who digs a hole but lives not in it?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is one<br />
					who digs a hole but lives not in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that mouse digs a hole but lives not in it,<br />
					even so using this figure<br />
					do I speak of this person.</p>
