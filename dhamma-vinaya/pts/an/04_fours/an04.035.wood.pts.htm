					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>,<br />
					in Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion Vassakāra the brahmin,<br />
					a great official of Magadha,<br />
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					greeted him courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br />
					Vassakāra the brahmin said this<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Gotama, we brahmins proclaim a man,<br />
					if he possesses four qualities,<br />
					as one of great wisdom,<br />
					as a great man.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, master Gotama, he is learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of whatsoever he hears<br />
					he understands the meaning<br />
					as soon as it is uttered,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the meaning of that saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the meaning of that saying."</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, he has a good memory,<br />
					he can remember and recall a thing<br />
					done long ago,<br />
					said long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, in all the business of a householder<br />
					he is skilled and diligent,<br />
					and therein he is resourceful<br />
					and capable of investigating<br />
					what is proper to be done,<br />
					what should be arranged.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br />
					if a man possess these qualities,<br />
					we proclaim him as one of great wisdom,<br />
					as a great man.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the worthy Gotama thinks me<br />
					worthy of commenda- <a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> tion herein,<br />
					let him commend me.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the contrary,<br />
					if he thinks me blameworthy,<br />
					let him blame me therefor.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, brahmin, I neither commend you<br />
					nor blame you herein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself proclaim a man<br />
					possessed of four qualities<br />
					to be one of great wisdom,<br />
					to be a great man.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, brahmin, we have a man<br />
					given up to the welfare of many folk,<br />
					to the happiness of many folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">By him are many folk<br />
					established in the Ariyan Method,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to wit:<br />
					in what is of a lovely nature,<br />
					in what is of a profitable nature</p>

					<p class="f4">To whatsoever train of thought<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he wishes to apply himself,<br />
					to that train of thought<br />
					he applies himself:<br />
					to whatever train of thought<br />
					he desires not to apply himself,<br />
					to that train of thought<br />
					he applies not himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever intention<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he wishes to apply himself,<br />
					to that intention<br />
					he applies himself:<br />
					to whatever intention<br />
					he desires not to apply himself,<br />
					to that intention<br />
					he applies not himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is he master of the mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the ways of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also he is one who attains at will,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					without difficulty<br />
					and without trouble<br />
					the four musings<br />
					which belong to the higher thought,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					which even in this very life<br />
					are blissful to abide in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also<br />
					by destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					in this very life<br />
					thoroughly comprehending it of himself,<br />
					he realizes the heart's release,<br />
					the release by wisdom,<br />
					and attaining it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, brahmin,<br />
					I neither commend nor blame you herein,<br />
					but I myself proclaim a man<br />
					possessed of these four qualities<br />
					to be one of great wisdom,<br />
					to be a great man.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, master Gotama,<br />
					bow well this has been said<br />
					by the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself do hold the worthy Gotama<br />
					to be possessed of these same four qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, the worthy Gotama<br />
					is given up to the welfare of many folk,<br />
					to the happiness of many folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">By him are <a id="pg42"><span class="f2 g"><b>[42]</b></span></a> many folk<br />
					established in the Ariyan Method,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					in what is of a lovely nature,<br />
					in what is of a profitable nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, the worthy Gotama,<br />
					to whatever train of thought<br />
					he wishes to apply himself,<br />
					to that train of thought<br />
					he applies himself:<br />
					to whatever train of thought<br />
					he desires not to apply himself,<br />
					to that train of thought<br />
					he applies not himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, the worthy Gotama,<br />
					to whatever intention<br />
					he wishes to apply himself,<br />
					to that intention<br />
					he applies himself:<br />
					to whatever intention<br />
					he desires not to apply himself,<br />
					to that intention<br />
					he applies not himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama<br />
					is master of the mind<br />
					in the ways of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama<br />
					is one who attains at will<br />
					without difficulty<br />
					and without trouble<br />
					the four musings<br />
					which belong to the higher thought,<br />
					which even in this very life<br />
					are blissful to abide in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama by destruction of the āsavas<br />
					in this very life<br />
					thoroughly comprehending it of himself,<br />
					he realizes the heart's release,<br />
					the release by wisdom,<br />
					and attaining it<br />
					abides therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, brahmin, your words come close<br />
					and challenge me to a statement.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will satisfy you by replying.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am indeed given up to the welfare of many folk,<br />
					to the happiness of many folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">By me are many folk established in the Ariyan Method,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					in what is of a lovely nature,<br />

					I desire to apply myself,<br />

					I apply myself:<br />

					I desire not to apply myself,<br />
					to that train of thought<br />
					I apply not myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, to whatever intention<br />
					I desire to apply myself,<br />
					to that intention<br />
					I apply myself:<br />
					to whatever intention<br />
					I desire not to apply myself,<br />
					to that intention<br />
					I apply not myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, brahmin,<br />
					I am master of the mind<br />
					in the ways of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indeed, brahmin, I am one who attains at will<br />
					without difficulty<br />
					and without trouble<br />
