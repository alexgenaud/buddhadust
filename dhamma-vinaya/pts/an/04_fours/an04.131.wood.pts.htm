<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 131. The Buddha describes four sorts of persons in relationship to the sorts of self-yokings to rebirth (saŋyojanāni) they have or have not yet got rid of. This sutta is especially relevant to the debate concerning whether or not there is some sort of continued existence between the time of death and the next rebirth." />
