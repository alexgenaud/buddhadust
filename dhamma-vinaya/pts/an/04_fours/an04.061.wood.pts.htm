					<p class="f4">And what is perfection of virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein the Ariyan disciple abstains from taking life,<br />

					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />

					fermented and distilled<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein the Ariyan disciple lives at home<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is perfection of wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">Housefather, living with his heart overcome<br />

					one does what he should not<br />
					fails to do what he should;<br />

					<p class="f4">Living with his heart overcome<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, that Ariyan disciple,<br />

					to be a depravity of the mind,<br />
					casts out the mind's depravity<br />
					of coveting and wrong desire;</p>

					<p class="f4">knowing malice<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, in so far as the Ariyan disciple,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">These four conditions, housefather,<br />

					delightful,<br />
					hard to win in the world.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather, that same Ariyan disciple,<br />
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br />
					is the doer of four deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, housefather, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple makes himself happy and cheerful,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he is a contriver of perfect happiness;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> makes his mother and father, his children and wife, his servants and workmen, his friends and comrades<br />
					cheerful and happy,<br />
					he is a contriver of perfect happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is the first opportunity<br />
					seized by him,<br />
					turned to merit<br />
					and fittingly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefather,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful and lawfully gotten, -<br />
					with that wealth<br />
					he makes himself secure<br />
					against all misfortunes whatsoever,<br />
					such as may happen by way of fire,<br />
					water,<br />
					the rajah,<br />
					a robber,<br />
					an ill-disposed person<br />
					or an (expectant) heir.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes steps<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> for his defence,<br />
					he makes himself secure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is the second opportunity<br />
					seized by him,<br />
					turned to merit<br />
					and fittingly made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, housefather,<br />
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful and lawfully gotten, -<br />
					the Ariyan disciple is a maker<br />
					of the fivefold offering,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> namely:<br />
					to relatives,<br />
					to guests,<br />
					to departed petas,<br />
					to the rajah<br />
					and to the devata.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third opportunity<br />
					seized by him,<br />
					turned to merit<br />
					and fittingly made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, housefather,<br />
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple offers a gift<br />
					to all such recluses and brahmins<br />
					as abstain from sloth and negligence,<br />
					who are bent on kindness and forbearance,<br />
					who tame the one self,<br />
					calm the one self,<br />
					cool<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> the one self,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					to such he offers a gift<br />
					which has the highest results,<br />
					a gift heavenly,<br />
					resulting in happiness<br />
					and leading to heaven.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This <a id="pg77"><span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></a> is the fourth opportunity<br />
					seized by him,<br />
					turned to merit<br />
					and fittingly made use of.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, housefather, this same Ariyan disciple,<br />
					with the wealth acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful and lawfully gotten,<br />
					is a doer of these four deeds of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the wealth of anyone<br />
					be spent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> without these four deeds of merit,<br />
					such wealth is called<br />
					"wealth that has failed<br />
					to seize its opportunity,<br />
					failed to win merit,<br />
					unfittingly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> made use of.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But, housefather, if the wealth of anyone<br />
					be spent on these four deeds of merit,<br />
					then it is called<br />
					"wealth that has seized its opportunity,<br />
					turned to merit,<br />
					and is fittingly made use of."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I have enjoyed my wealth. Those serving me<br />
							And those dependent on me have escaped<br />
							From dangers. I have made the best of gifts,<br />
							Nay, done th' oblations five. The virtuous,<br />
							Composed, who live the good life, I've supported.<br />
							That aim<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> the which to win householders wise<br />
							Should long for wealth, I've won. I've done a deed<br />
							Never to be regretted, - pondering thus<br />
							A mortal man in Ariyan dhamma firm<br />
							Is praised in this world, then in heaven rejoices.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>
