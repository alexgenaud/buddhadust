					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four modes of progress.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The painful mode of progress with sluggish intuition,<br />
					the painful mode with swift intuition,<br />
					the pleasant mode of progress with sluggish intuition,<br />
					the pleasant mode with swift intuition.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four modes of progress.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the mode of progress<br />
					that is painful<br />
					with sluggish intuition?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one is by nature<br />
					passionately lustful;<br />
					he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br />
					passionately malicious;<br />
					he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br />
					passionately infatuated;<br />
					he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such an one<br />
					these five controlling faculties<br />
					are dully <a id="pg154"><span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span></a> manifested,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, owing to the dullness of these five faculties,<br />
					sluggish is his attainment<br />
					of the concentration that follows on<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					"the progress that is painful<br />
					with sluggish intuition."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the mode of progress<br />
					that is painful<br />
					but with swift intuition?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one is by nature<br />
					passionately lustful;<br />
					he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br />

					he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise he is by nature<br />
					passionately infatuated;<br />
					he experiences the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such an one<br />
					these five controlling faculties<br />
					are manifested in abundance,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					and the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, owing to the preponderance of these five faculties,<br />
					swift is his attainment<br />
					of the concentration that follows on<br />
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					"the progress that is painful<br />
					but with swift intuition."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the mode of progress<br />
					that is pleasant,<br />
					but with sluggish intuition?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one<br />
					is not by nature passionately lustful;<br />
					he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately malicious;<br />
					he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br />

					"the mode of progress that is pleasant,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is the mode of progress that is both pleasant<br />
					and accompanied by swift intuition?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one is not by nature passionately lustful;<br />
					he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately malicious;<br />
					he does not experience the perpetual pain and dejection<br />
					that are born of malice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is he by nature passionately infatuated;<br />

					<p class="f4">And in such an one these five controlling faculties are manifested in abundance, to wit:<br />

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />

					<p class="f4">So these are the four modes of progress.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ānantariyaɱ (sc. samādhiɱ).</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>VM.</i> ii, 675, which quotes our sutta, and <i>Sn.</i> 226:</p>

							Samādhiɱ ānantarikaɱ nam āhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This failure to attain is due to the hindrances (<i>cf.</i> <i>Expos.</i> i, 244) - <i>i.e.,</i> it is difficult for him to give up the lower nature without a great struggle. This painful progress is described in <a href="an04.163.wood.pts.htm">§ 163.</a></p>
