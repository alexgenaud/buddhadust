					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Sikha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Moggallāna, the brahmin, came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg240"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span></a>Having greeted him courteously he took a seat at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side Sikha Moggallāna the brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend Gotama, the other day or a few days ago the youth Soṇa-Kāyana came to me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Gotama the recluse proclaims the ineffectiveness of all deeds.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In doing so, sir,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> he has uttered annihilation of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, sir, it is in deed that the world is real.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It persists in (man's) continual effort in his deeds!"'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'For my part, brahmin, I know not the youth Soṇa-Kāyana even by sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whence then such a talk (by me)?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brahmin, these four deeds I have myself comprehended,<br />
					realized<br />
					and made known.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a dark deed<br />
					with a dark result;<br />
					a bright deed<br />
					with a bright result;<br />
					a deed that is both dark and bright,<br />
					with a dark and bright result;<br />
					and the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br />

					conduces to the waning of deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, brahmin<br />
					is the deed that is dark,<br />
					with a dark result?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahmin a certain one<br />
					plans planned bodily action<br />
					joined with harm<br />
					plans planned action of speech,<br />
					joined with harm,<br />
					plans planned action of thought,<br />
					joined with harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus planning harmful action of body,<br />
					planning harmful action of speech<br />
					planning harmful action of thought,<br />
					is born into a world that is harmful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus born into a harmful world,<br />
					harmful contacts contact him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus touched by harmful contacts<br />
					he feels feeling that is harmful,<br />
					that is sheer pain,<br />
					just as do beings in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin is called<br />
					"the dark deed with a dark result."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, brahmin<br />
					is the bright deed<br />
					with the bright result?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahmin a certain one<br />
					plans planned bodily action<br />
					that is not joined with harm<br />
					plans planned action of speech,<br />
					that is not joined with harm,<br />
					plans planned action of thought,<br />
					that is not joined with harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus planning harmless action of body,<br />
					planning harmless action of speech<br />
					planning harmless action of thought,<br />
					is born into a world that is harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">So born into a harmless world<br />
					harmless contacts touch him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus touched by harmless contacts,<br />
					experiences feeling that is harmless,<br />
					utter bliss,<br />
					such as do the Ever-radiant devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin is called<br />
					"the bright deed with a bright result."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, brahmin<br />
					is the deed that is both dark and bright,<br />
					with a result that is both dark and bright?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahmin a certain one<br />
					plans planned bodily action<br />
					that is joined with harm and harmlessness,<br />
					plans planned action of speech,<br />
					that is joined with harm and harmlessness,<br />
					plans planned action of thought,<br />
					that is joined with harm and harmlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thus planning action of body,<br />
					that is both harmful and harmless<br />
					planning harmless action of speech<br />
					that is both harmful and harmless<br />
					planning harmless action of thought,<br />
					that is both harmful and harmless<br />
					is born into a world<br />
					that is both harmful and harmless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by contacts<br />
					both harmful and harmless<br />
					he experiences feeling<br />
					that is both harmful and harmless,<br />
					a mixture of pleasure and pain,<br />
					such as for instance some humans,<br />
					some devas,<br />
					and some dwellers in purgatory feel.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin is called<br />
					"the deed that is both dark and bright,<br />
					with a result that is both dark and bright."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, brahmin<br />
					is the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br />
					with a result that is neither dark nor bright,<br />
					which, itself a deed,<br />
					conduces to the waning of deeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahmin<br />
					the intention to abandon this dark deed<br />
					with its dark result,<br />
					the intention to abandon this bright deed<br />
					with its bright result,<br />
					the intention to abandon this deed both dark and bright<br />
					with a its result both dark and bright, -<br />
					this intention is called<br />
					"the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br />
					with a result that is neither dark nor bright,<br />
					which, itself a deed,<br />
					conduces to the waning of deeds."</p>

					<p class="f4">These four deeds I have myself comprehended,<br />
