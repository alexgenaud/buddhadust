					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four deeds I have myself comprehended,<br />
					realized<br />
					and made known.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a dark deed<br />
					with a dark result;<br />
					a bright deed<br />
					with a bright result;<br />
					a deed that is both dark and bright,<br />
					with a dark and bright result;<br />
					and the deed that is neither dark nor bright,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus born into a harmful world,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus touched by harmful contacts<br />
